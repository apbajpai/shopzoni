(1, 9, '0', 'Ronald McDonald, We Have Company', '<p>At the Indiabulls Finance Centre &amp; One Indiabulls Centre on Mumbai&rsquo;s Senapati Bapat Road, the lights have been staying on late than usual on the 10th floor of Tower 3 and the 16th floor of Tower 2A respectively. In these adjacent high rises, a couple of boardrooms have been a beehive of activity. One is the market leader by miles and the second, an unpretentious contender not only in the Indian market which it has just entered but also in its home base where it is a distant second. Even from an overall perspective, its 13,000 outlets seem puny compared with the leader which has 14,000 in the US alone. This heft is also reflected in a market cap of $92 billion compared with the contender&rsquo;s $12 billion (<em>see: Who&rsquo;s your daddy</em>). Tower 3 is home to the offices of Hardcastle Restaurants, the development licensee (West and South India) for McDonald&rsquo;s Corporation while Tower 2A houses Everstone Capital, a private equity firm which is the master franchisee for Burger King in India. For now, Burger King India, too, works out of the Everstone office. By the time you are reading this, both will be fiercely competing less than a mile away at High Street Phoenix, a high footfall retail destination in Mumbai. The irony is that they will literally be within shouting distance at many of the high profile locations. Given their overlapping target market, is such an in the face presence a source of worry for McDonald&rsquo;s India?</p>\r\n<p>[[QUOTE]]</p>\r\n<p><img style="float: left; margin: 10px;" title="Market value" src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-15/1418634417.jpg" alt="Market value" width="500" height="188" /></p>\r\n<p>Hardly so, feels Amit Jatia, vice-chairman, Westlife Development, the listed entity which houses Hardcastle Restaurants. &ldquo;They are opening a few restaurants. We have 350, for them to make an impact in India; they first need to get a 100. We like to compete when a brand is right next to us as that is when the differentiation stands out. As nobody has a location advantage, it boils down to execution. Somebody coming next to us at the mall doesn&rsquo;t matter to us.&rdquo; That is not cockiness but ground reality from someone whose brand has single handedly grown the category and made burgers a much familiar item of consumption in India.</p>\r\n<p>[[QUOTE]]</p>\r\n<p>Informal eating out is a $90 billion market and growing at about 10% a year. Within that, western fast food is growing at 15% a year and the organised sector&rsquo;s share is about a billion dollars. Given a turnover of about Rs 1,500 crore in India, McDonald&rsquo;s roughly has a 25% market share of the organised sector. This heft has been created through nearly two decades of patient investment.&nbsp; When further pressed about the advantages and disadvantages that late comers such as Burger King enjoy, Jatia shares, &ldquo;The biggest advantage for a new comer is that there is a supply chain in place. The disadvantage is there is a very strong global leader. Business is not just about opening doors. Enough restaurants have opened their doors in India. Competitive advantage comes from real estate, supply chain and customer connect. It is not that easy a thing to put together.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Paving The Path</strong></p>\r\n<p>To the uninitiated, this may again come across as self boast. But speak to almost anyone in the industry and there is unanimity about the role that McDonald&rsquo;s India has played in developing a reliable supply chain in the country. Post its entry, McDonald&rsquo;s worked directly with farmers to address its requirements. Samar Gupta, director, Trikaya Agriculture was among the first to work with McDonald&rsquo;s as it went about building its sourcing network. The company supported him in growing superior lettuce and he ended up as its biggest supplier of fresh iceberg lettuce in its earlier years. He stopped supplying to McDonald&rsquo;s as he wanted to focus on being an exotic agro boutique rather than a mass supplier as margins are better in the former. His reminiscence, &ldquo;McDonald&rsquo;s brought in a new level of intensity to sourcing. When their people visited the farm, it was serious business for them. For most five-star hotels that we supply to, it is still more of a picnic when they come down to my farm.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Gupta also adds that while many organisations talk about best practices, 90% of them are just talk. &ldquo;In one of the sandwich chains that I used to supply to, because of its franchised model, it clearly used to be a free for all. In some cases, lettuce was chopped right off the floor. McDonald&rsquo;s is a stickler for processes unlike at the other chains where a lot of them just went by the supplier&rsquo;s word. McDonald&rsquo;s tested everything, including for residue.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Given its early mover advantage and deep processes, couldn&rsquo;t McDonald&rsquo;s have created an entry barrier by opting for exclusive sourcing arrangements with all its suppliers? Well, turns out it is not the parent&rsquo;s policy to do so. Jatia says, &ldquo;We do handshakes with suppliers, not agreements. Our French fries comes from the same supplier who sells to everybody else but McDonald&rsquo;s French fries are McDonald&rsquo;s French fries. That is because we have proprietary potatoes and processes.&rdquo; This level of supplier trust is something that Gupta clearly remembers as well. &ldquo;They were very comfortable letting suppliers mingle among themselves unlike a typical Indian mindset where you would want to keep them apart for fear of them discussing what each of them was paid,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Many, who came in latter have ridden on the back of the supply chain put in place by McDonald&rsquo;s. Gupta cites the almost year round availability of lettuce. &ldquo;Because McDonald&rsquo;s popularised lettuce, now a lot of farms in Ooty grow it, so availability is not an issue.&rdquo; The current situation is a far cry from the day when McDonald&rsquo;s had a stock out situation and had to use cabbage. Since that was unacceptable, the unhappy experience led them to plan for future stock out scenarios (<em>see: Round-the-clock delivery</em>).</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>Round-The-Clock Delivery</p>\r\n<p><strong>A world-class supply chain ensures a zero stock out at every McDonald&rsquo;s outlet</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Annual consumption</em></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Buns&nbsp;<strong>150 million</strong></li>\r\n<li>Million litres of special vegetarian sauce&nbsp;<strong>3.2 million</strong></li>\r\n<li>Patties&nbsp;<strong>100 million</strong></li>\r\n<li>Cheese Slices&nbsp;<strong>350 metric tonne</strong></li>\r\n<li>Fresh Iceberg Lettuce&nbsp;<strong>1,500 tonne</strong></li>\r\n<li>Tons Of Tomatoes&nbsp;<strong>1,000 tonne</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em>Source: Company</em></p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>Burger King, too, might rely on the usual suspects for supplies as it goes about expanding in India. And while a lot of strategy might get discussed in the boardroom and one can hype up one&rsquo;s arrival on social media, the honchos at Burger King are aware that the moment of truth is when the customer troops in and tries out the Indian whopper, be it chicken, mutton or vegetarian. Burger King might be the newest kid on the burger block but Rajeev Varman who runs it in India is a Burger King veteran. He used to run Burger King&rsquo;s operations in the UK earlier and it is now upon him to deliver a whopper of a presence.</p>\r\n<p>Burger King&rsquo;s approach to the Indian market is at odds compared to what it is doing in the home market. Out there it not only franchises but is also actively selling its owned stores in favor of an asset light model. In India, not only has it agreed to a minority stake but is also going to operate its own stores. This test-the- waters approach on the part of 3G Capital, the aggressive owner of Burger King seems to suggest that they wouldn&rsquo;t be averse to walking away if the numbers don&rsquo;t show up in the desired timeframe. 3G is known to run a very tight ship and one needs to see how patient they are willing to be in a deep duration market like India. Burger King India&rsquo;s point of view could not be obtained as despite repeated attempts, they did not respond after having asked for a questionnaire.</p>\r\n<p>While the intent is to open about 12 outlets in the next three months, Varman was quoted by Reuters as saying, &ldquo;In India, we will set up our first few restaurants and use that to fine-tune our operating model before determining our growth plans.&rdquo; Burger King&rsquo;s choice of partner Everstone is also interesting. Everstone is helping out with stores where the initial outlets are coming up. For instance, the High Street Phoenix outlet earlier housed Spaghetti Kitchen; a brand owned by Blue Foods, which itself is controlled by Everstone, ditto for its first outlet at Select Citywalk Mall in Delhi. There, too, a Spaghetti Kitchen made way for a Burger King. Even from an equity partner&rsquo;s perspective, if the venture gathers critical mass for 3G&rsquo;s comfort, it could very well buy Everstone out. But that for now is the equivalent of wishing for the moon from terra firma.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Burger King has a very long way to compete before it enjoys some semblance of recall in the Indian market which has its own idiosyncrasies in terms of perception not to mention taste. Jatia recalls the experience of his early days. Cleanliness and value are prime planks on which McDonald&rsquo;s operates and that is what it put into practice when it entered India. &ldquo;We built spick and span restaurants for our customers which offered affordably priced meals. But the neat look of the restaurants itself ended up becoming a barrier as customers thought it must be expensive and one should be well dressed to get in,&rdquo;&nbsp;says Jatia. The company changed that through advertising about the fun nature of the brand and emphasising that it was easy on the pocket.</p>\r\n<p><img style="float: left; margin: 10px;" title="Taste preference" src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-15/1418634601.jpg" alt="Taste preference" width="220" height="276" /></p>\r\n<p><strong>Matter Of Taste</strong></p>\r\n<p>While that perception issue was addressed by imagery, getting the taste right in a diverse market like India is a herculean task (see: Give me Red). After the first bite, the challenge is getting the right word of mouth. It is a test that will be faced not only by Burger King but all the other new burger chains that have entered or plan to venture into India. Among those already here include Johnny Rockets as well as Fatburger and in the pipeline are Carl&rsquo;s Jr., Wendy&rsquo;s and Dairy Queen. Johnny Rockets currently has three outlets up and running. Prime Gourmet, the master franchisee for Johnny Rockets, decided to take no chances and drafted noted chef Bakshish Dean on board. But that did not prevent their original vegetarian offering, a soya patty, from crashing off the menu. Since then Dean has consistently worked to Indianise Johnny Rockets&rsquo; offerings to suit the Indian palate. He details, &ldquo;The primary challenge was to make a bridge between international flavours and what the palate in India wants. One outcome is a vegetarian burger called Ultimate Veggie. It has a European style flavoring yet connects with the Indian palate that likes garlic, thyme and oregano. When you bite into it, it is 85% vegetables unlike other vegetable patties which is primarily potato with specks of vegetables. We upped the seasoning a bit, added a hint of spice and it has worked very well for us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Like Jatia, Dean has had his own share of surprises in a market that has a high vegetarian population. McDonald&rsquo;s today sells 1.5 chicken burgers for every one vegetarian burger. Even during Burger King&rsquo;s pre-booking offer in the north in the run-up to its launch, the biggest preference displayed was for chicken burgers, then mutton and vegetarian. As for Dean&rsquo;s shocker, &ldquo;Our highest selling burger is called Houston whether in chicken, tenderloin or vegetarian builds. It is an actual Johnny Rockets recipe and we haven&rsquo;t changed it at all. But we clearly did not expect a demand ratio of 60% tenderloin and 40% chicken when we started off.&nbsp; Now it has settled at 55% chicken and 45% tenderloin.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Jay Singh&rsquo;s experience at the high end, though, has a twist. He is the co-founder of JSM Corp, which has straddled the entire spectrum from a nightspot to fine dining. His experience running casual dining brands such as Hard Rock Caf&eacute; and California Pizza Kitchen reveal that at the top end there is a distinct vegetarian bias. &ldquo;At our price point, there is more similarity than difference between the consumer here and the other parts of the world. Of the top five, at least two or three menu preferences will be in the top five globally. However, vegetarian offerings with high-end ingredients account for 50% to 60% of our sales.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>While Carl&rsquo;s Jr. is working on a 60% vegetarian and 40% chicken menu for its launch next year, Sam Chopra, chairman, CybizCorp, which is getting the brand into India, says, &ldquo;Outside of a Wednesday or Sunday, many Indians are vegetarians either by religion or personal choice.&rdquo; He also says that in India, most people consider burger to be healthy and pizza to be unhealthy. &ldquo;Pizza has much visible cheese and burger has salad and the option of whole wheat bread which can be dressed down a low calorie burger. The fried patty can be replaced by chargrilled, which we will do,&rdquo; he adds. Burger King, too, will offer flame-grilled patties and is bringing its own menu innovations such as mutton burger and vegetarian options like Spicy Bean Royale, Paneer King Melt and Veg Chilli Cheese Melt.</p>\r\n<p>While Jatia doesn&rsquo;t rule out the chances of McDonald&rsquo;s launching a mutton burger, he says it is remote. He elaborates, &ldquo;We started with the mutton burger in 1996-1997. There are supply chain constraints in mutton and limited interest and we found the chicken platform to be more standard. We recently launched a mutton burger in Australia. We keep bringing things from the globe. If we find that consumers are favoring it, we may or may not bring it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><img style="margin: 10px; float: right;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-15/1418634654.jpg" alt="Supply chain" width="300" height="287" /></p>\r\n<p><strong>Building It Right</strong></p>\r\n<p>McDonald&rsquo;s massive size and reach does lead to a lot of cross learning but it is not all smooth sailing for the Golden Arches as it is dealing with turmoil back home as well as in India. Its overall sales have continued to plummet this year as niche burger chains such as Shake Shack and Five Guys continue to roll in the dough. The parent&rsquo;s Q3 topline and profit also took a hit due to increased competition in its home market (Chipotle that it had funded and held equity in earlier, is growing faster and now has a market cap of $20 billion), the food scare in China and Putin hitting back in Russia by closing down 9 outlets and citing health &amp; hygiene violations continues to investigate more than 200 others.</p>\r\n<p>In India, it is sparring with its partner in the North and East. The exact genesis of the dispute between the parent and Connaught Plaza Restaurants is still not clear. Vikram Bakshi did not respond to questions on what exactly triggered off the current state of affairs nor elaborated on his contribution in establishing McDonald&rsquo;s in the areas that he earlier used to oversee. Hearsay varies from Bakshi alleging preferential treatment to Jatia&rsquo;s Hardcastle Restaurants to allegations of impropriety on Bakshi&rsquo;s part. Left to itself, the US parent would want Bakshi out of its cross hairs, so that it can protect and grow its business in the North and East market. Already, Burger King has chosen Delhi as it launch market and so have a lot of other burger chains like Johnny Rockets, Carl&rsquo;s Jr. and Fatburger among others.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There is enough launch buzz now to get footfalls in for Burger King but to manage that on a sustained basis in the current economic climate has been challenging for Jatia as well. Same store sales have been falling and for the first half of the current financial year his company reported nearly a Rs 15 crore loss compared to a profit of about Rs 3 crore in the same period last year (<em>see: Investing to grow</em>).</p>\r\n<p>The current red ink does not bother Jatia much as he says he is building for the future and this temporary trough is well understood by his investors. &ldquo;Every new restaurant I build I lose money. So my P&amp;L is only going to get worse. My investors understand that it is an operating leverage business. I started my first restaurant in 1996 but the first time we made money was in 2009. That time we were privately held, so nobody cared. As we now start scaling again, there is twin pressure. Cost pressure and new stores are taking away our profits and in the old stores, same store sales are negative,&rdquo; he explains.</p>\r\n<p>Jatia is aiming for a critical mass of 500 to 1,000 restaurants and is opening 30 to 40 stores a year. As he expands, his pet theme is broadening accessibility, which translates to being accessible and affordable to customers. He explains, &ldquo;We just opened a restaurant in Vasai. Previously they had to drive 30 minutes. By going close to them, they will build McDonald&rsquo;s into their life. I also need to be affordable. Then you will visit more often, you will eat more often. We have played a significant role in moving the eating out frequency from 3 in 2003 to 8 times a month now in Mumbai If a restaurant in Kalyan (a far flung Mumbai suburb) does as well as the one at Crossroads (India&rsquo;s first mall at South Mumbai) that is because they can afford it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>To this, Singh adds a word of caution. He reminds, &ldquo;Low prices are not sustainable as costs are not going down. So, something has to give. You lower prices with the assumption that your economies of scale are going to kick in and you can become more and more efficient to sustain that price. Those are untested assumptions.&rdquo; Asked if he has considered a price hike to offset input costs, Jatia answers, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t react in a knee-jerk manner in matters of pricing. So, if my input costs have suddenly gone up, I need to absorb it and maintain consistency. Menu prices can take half the pressure and the other half we will extract through productivity growth at the suppliers end.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><img style="margin: 10px; float: right;" title="Investing to grow" src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-15/1418634703.jpg" alt="Investment" width="300" height="263" /></p>\r\n<p><strong>Keep Them Coming&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>Unlike Jatia, who is banking on scale, Vishal Chaudhry at Johnny Rockets does not have that pressure. For a Johnny Rockets or Singh&rsquo;s Hard Rock Caf&eacute; for that matter hitting 150 outlets is not the driver. Given the limited capital, being profitable as early as possible is. In fact, the very reason that Prime Gourmet decided to go with Johnny Rockets was because there was flexibility in terms of format and menu localisation. &ldquo;We have the flexibility to go into a location like Ambience Mall, which is 2,500 square feet with 92 covers or Select City, which is 1,500 square feet. Our sweet spot is 60 covers but we can go down to 40. This flexibility allows us to balance footfall, rentals and the overall business model,&rdquo; says Chaudhry as the servers break into their regular dance routine, a Johnny Rockets differentiator.</p>\r\n<p>As you look around the Johnny Rockets outlet at Gurgaon&rsquo;s Ambience Mall during the weekday lunch hour, many notions about India&rsquo;s eating habits get dismantled. With classics from the 60s, 70s and the 80s wafting in the background, Johnny Rockets is supposed to be an American Diner where the typical demographic should be expatriates wanting to feel at home, tourists looking for familiar eating spots or the well travelled looking for a genuine burger experience or working executives. While you do have all of the above, also in tow with their parents are kids and at a faraway table teenagers with their grandparents. Despite this diverse patron profile, Gaurav Sharma, director, Prime Gourmet, says, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t consider ourselves competing with a McDonald&rsquo;s. It is a different price point. We consider our competition to be casual dining chains like Chili&rsquo;s, Nando&rsquo;s or Big Chill. People who prefer us don&rsquo;t want to spend thousands on fine dining but don&rsquo;t either want to go to a McDonald&rsquo;s and have a QSR kind of experience.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The 70% to 80% weekday occupancy at Johnny Rocket&rsquo;s biggest outlet is heartening but Singh thinks hyper growth will take its time coming as the industry tackles affordability issues and eating habits. He says he agrees with Yum India&rsquo;s President, Niren Chaudhary&rsquo;s assessment about India being a case of &lsquo;first world cost, third world pricing&rsquo;. &ldquo;Our cost structure in the industry is becoming close to what it is in the West and the pricing power is probably 30% of what prevails there,&rdquo; he points out. With respect to food habits, he says, Indians like things that fill them up. That is why wraps of different kinds sell. In Chinese food, there is a clear preference for things to be saucy and gravy. &ldquo;In India, the appetisers are dry but the main course is always gravy or curry. If you really want to expand, you got to address that, &ldquo;he says. Hence, the only way out, he says, for mass players is to localise their offering and aggressively sweat their assets.</p>\r\n<p>Singh&rsquo;s prescription has already been swallowed by a lot of QSR players. KFC is offering a rice bowl. Even at Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts, it is the more (burgers and sandwiches) that is selling more. McDonald&rsquo;s is also working on filling up its restaurants in the slack hours by reaching out through different formats, be it through breakfast options, McCafe, online delivery or a Drive-thru.</p>\r\n<p>Jatia is banking on McCafe and wraps to reverse the decline in same store sales. &ldquo;We have 27 McCafe compared with zero last October and plan to ramp up to 75 by end of next year. McCafe gets me into your consideration set if you are a regular coffee drinker. Then there is wraps as it has a roti feel. Customers are increasingly buying it with a meal. So, we will play with more choice and options there. Then there is the flatbread option in case you want something different from the bun option.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>So, will all this be enough to help McDonald&rsquo;s India grow and protect its turf? Jatia grabs this opportunity to pull out his trump card, &ldquo;There is a whole generation that has grown up with us. Kids &amp; teens have celebrated birthday parties at McDonald&rsquo;s. People like to click their pictures with Ronald McDonald. You can&rsquo;t take away that brand connect or nostalgia.&rdquo; Well, that is certainly true. Parents don&rsquo;t go to McDonald&rsquo;s, their kids drag them there. And if the grown-ups drag the kids into Burger King for a curiosity visit, &lsquo;doesn&rsquo;t feel like McD&rsquo; is the last thing the guys in Tower 2A would like to hear. Kids may not be their core market but pester power is a killer multiplier. As for those huddled in Tower 3, they might just go, &ldquo;We Are Lovin&rsquo; It&rdquo;.</p>', 'The burger and fries pasha may no longer be the only player in town but that is hardly a deterrent as it goes about deepening its market reach', '2', '501,494', 0, 'ca496bf5dbd230afb59242c98a28f9cb.jpg', 'ronald-mcdonald-we-have-company-1', 1, 1, 1, 1, 19, 'Ronald McDonald, We Have Company', 'The burger and fries pasha may no longer be the only player in town but that is hardly a deterrent as it goes about deepening its market reach', '', '', '', 'Burger chains,Burgers,McDonald,Burger King,Johnny Rockets', 0, NULL, '2014-12-15 14:45:49', '2015-06-19 17:52:39', '2014-11-28', 43),

In doing so he realised that there was a scalable business opportunity staring him in the face &mdash; an affordable daily-wear jewellery brand that offered women a variety of cheap and trendy pieces. &ldquo;Gold and diamond sets are costly and can&rsquo;t be updated often. So, I decided to sell handcrafted earrings (#500-#2,500), rings (#800-#1,500), bracelets, pendants (#1,000-#2,500) and neckpieces (#3,000 and above) made from semi-precious natural stones and a mix of silver and copper,&rdquo; he says.

(3, 12, '', 'Not Socially Awkward Anymore', '<p class="p1">Take one surreptitious look over your shoulder on your next local train or metro ride and be prepared to face a flurry of updates and pings emanating from the dimly-lit screens closest to you. Welcome to the 21st century, where citizens nurture a fervent and almost umbilical connection to their smartphones, constantly stalking strangers, reading about celebrity lives with voyeuristic pleasure or sharing intimate details of their own mundane lives online. Not surprising, then, that most brands seem to have caught on to this trend. According to a 2013 study by Ernst &amp; Young on social media marketing, 42% of companies said they spend anywhere between 1% and 5% of their marketing spend on social media; 17% spend between 20-30%. Around 30% of the respondents said their social media marketing budgets were between Rs 11 lakh&nbsp;and Rs 25 lakh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p1"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418904053.jpg" alt="Waiting for Godot" width="808" height="551" /></p>\n<p class="p3">Though the greatest demand still remains for search engine optimisation, companies are slowly realising the impact that social media can have as a marketing and consumer engagement tool. Ramesh Chembath, assistant vice-president, sales and marketing, Godrej Appliances, says, &ldquo;We evaluated the nascent digital space as far back as 2010. While there is still scope for growth in the space, we have realised that making the shift to digital back then was the right step. Social media marketing is not just about Facebook likes; as we already know, engagement is the key. Digital marketing not only reduces costs but also improves marketing efficiency by spreading word through various platforms.&rdquo; And it is not just the old economy that is betting big on social media &mdash; even businesses that thrive on the new economy are taking note of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Praveen Sinha, founder and managing director, Jabong, says, &ldquo;Everyone has to build their own USP and position themselves on social media in terms of quality of responses and turnaround time. They cannot be entirely impersonal in their interactions on such platforms.&rdquo; Leena Shoor, marketing head of Maybelline India, says, &ldquo;As the digital space becomes more and more important as a medium to target the young Indian consumer, our spend has kept pace with it at about 25% of our advertising budgets each year.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">With digital marketing slowly gaining ground, a whole new bunch of start-ups looking to advise companies on their social marketing strategies have also sprung up. While larger umbrella agencies have the required leverage over smaller agencies, the past few years have seen the start-ups grow organically to gain prominence and be accessed by big brands thanks to their reliability. Rajiv Dingra kicked off one such initiative by starting WATConsult in Mumbai in 2007. Started with three other friends as an attempt to work freelance in the digital space, WATConsult bagged Rediff as its first client, with the Rs 4 lakh advance received from that account serving as the initial investment in the business.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418904134.jpg" alt="Rajiv Dhingra" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>"People, technology and processes comprise a lot of our expenses currently" - Rajiv Dhingra, Founder and CEO, WATConsult</strong></span></p>\n<p class="p3">Starting off by offering social media management and creative work to begin with, WATConsult now offers a wider range of services, from social media marketing to video and mobile apps development and search engine optimisation. Dingra says he holds what one could call the first-mover advantage. &ldquo;Being one of the first few agencies to do what we do, we had a lot of time at hand to learn how to avoid mistakes that relatively inexperienced agencies would make. Since my blog &mdash; which served as an inspiration for the agency &mdash; was about the digital space, we never had to go out of our way to learn how to make things work on social media. It was our lack of financial management skills that was our initial failing but we had enough time to recover from it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418905573.jpg" alt="WATConsult" width="808" height="551" /></p>\n<p class="p3">And how. Today, WATConsult has around 85 clients on a retainer basis, 150+ employees and four offices across Mumbai, New Delhi, Bengaluru and Kolkata. Under a retainer arrangement, the client pays the agency a pre-specified amount in lump sum or EMIs. With a top line growth rate of 80-90% and profit margins of up to 30%, Dingra is confident that the agency will be able to clock Rs 27 crore in revenue by the end of FY15 &mdash; almost double its revenue figures of Rs 15 crore in FY14 &mdash; by charging a retainer fee of Rs 2.5 lakh-3 lakh. With video production for the digital space and mobile apps becoming more commonplace, WATConsult has realised that technology still remains its greatest expense, with 10-15% of spend going towards the same. &ldquo;People, technology and processes comprise a lot of our expenses at the moment. But those are costs that we are prepared for; we have built up on internal accruals over the years,&rdquo; says Dingra.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Around the time that WATConsult came to life, four friends came together in 2008 on a mission of sorts. After pooling in Rs 16,000 each, Pratik Gupta, Harshil Karia, Suveer Bajaj and Paritosh Ajmera started FoxyMoron in Mumbai, named so to be, well, oxymoronic. About what started off as just a way to be different from the rest of their Bachelors in Management Studies classmates, Gupta, its director for new business and innovation, says the company has now turned out to be a seven-year long internship for the group. &ldquo;A website was as digital as companies could get back when we started FoxyMoron. The first 15 months taught us a lot about the industry and about what clients want, and being heavy users of social media ourselves, we realised that brands would want to pursue social media as well at some point in time. That&rsquo;s when we shifted to being a full-fledged digital agency.&rdquo; The first services that were offered were website-making and blog creation, both handled by Ajmera. Its first major client being PVR Pictures, FoxyMoron was responsible for the campaign for the <em>Twilight</em> movie franchise when it first made its entry into India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418904433.jpg" alt="FoxyMoron team" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Writing your own rules for a new space is tough. We questionedall the rules that came in from offline advertising"- Pratik Gupta, Co-founder, FoxyMoron&nbsp;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class="p3">At the moment, FoxyMoron has around 70 clients, to whom it provides digital solutions &mdash; referred to as 360 Digital &mdash; depending on their needs on a retainer basis, and has serviced 500-600 of them, including big names such as Maybelline India, Viber India, Starbucks and Quikr. They seem to be growing in terms of revenue as well. Starting off from earning Rs 30,000 per month, FoxyMoron managed to rake in a total of Rs 25 crore in the last fiscal and is expecting Rs 40 crore by the end of this year. &ldquo;At 22, it doesn&rsquo;t help when you have to write your own rules about a space that is in its nascent stage. In fact, we started questioning all the rules that came in from offline advertising,&rdquo; adds Gupta.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418904609.jpg" alt="FoxyMoron" width="808" height="551" /></p>\n<p class="p3">One of the rules FoxyMoron questioned was the need for a client servicing team and, consequently, to this day, it functions without one. However, employee retention and training remain its greatest challenges, with the company having to spend Rs 45,000 per employee to train them about the latest developments in the digital space.</p>\n<p class="p3">FoxyMoron is still struggling to find ways to be able to keep up with its own growth, especially after opening a second office in Gurgaon in July 2013. &ldquo;We were a team of 80 people in 2013, now we are a team of over 200 people. We end up saying no to a lot of business because we cannot create the required bandwidth that quickly,&rdquo; says Gupta. In June 2012, the company added video production to its portfolio, adding PR to its varied digital services by 2013.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Looking ahead, Gupta says, &ldquo;To scale up without losing touch with our creative impulses is the challenge. We would eventually like to merge media planning and creative work for the digital space. Right now, 35% of our revenue comes from creative and media work each. The remaining 30% comes from our remaining services such as PR, video production, SEO and the like.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While some players have chosen to act as social media solutions providers, others have taken roads less travelled. Bhupendra Khanal founded Simplify360 in 2009 after his first venture, Marketelligent, kicked off. Being a data enthusiast, this seemed like the most obvious solution to combine social media and data analytics, though it didn&rsquo;t come into being with the idea of being a monitoring solution for companies. &ldquo;The challenge was that there are multiple sources of data because of the various platforms available to the public. All these social conversations were important; our job, then, is simply to provide the data with a unified view to our clients,&rdquo; says Khanal. After two years of R&amp;D, the company finally began operations in 2011 and earned its first client in Caf&eacute; Coffee Day. After building a crawler to keep up with conversations, it soon started working with media agencies and BPO companies and decided to take the platform ahead. It built a social marketing suite in 2012 that integrates Simplify360&rsquo;s analytical findings to help companies measure RoI for their social marketing campaigns. &ldquo;The marketing suite does three things &mdash; listen, analyse and publish. We may not be active in creating campaigns but we provide platforms for them by providing intelligence from markets,&rdquo; explains Khanal. Product revenue contributes to 80% of his total revenue, which, as of FY14, stood at Rs 3 crore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418904684.jpg" alt="Bhupendra Kanwal" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We may not be active in creating campaigns but we set up platforms by providing intelligence from markets" - Bhupendra Khanal, Founder, Simplify360</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class="p3">Khanal soon realised that some of the greatest beneficiaries of his data were media companies and BPOs &mdash; in fact, his clientele still consists of around 70 media entities and seven BPOs. With a 30% growth rate month-on-month, the company is only expected to do better in future, with Rs 18 crore expected by the end of FY15. Priced at Rs 25,000 and upwards, Simplify360&rsquo;s platform fee is decided by brand image and perception, with airline and telecom companies paying the highest price for the service. While intelligence gathering for India-specific needs was what opened the door for the company, customer relationship management data remains the largest contributor to revenue.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418904894.jpg" alt="Simplify360" width="808" height="551" /></p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>THE REAL WORLD</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">However, things are not always hunky dory for such agencies. Though competition is tough, they seem confident about being able to tide over those issues, at least for now. Dingra says, &ldquo;By virtue of owning the mainline spend, the Ogilvys and WPPs of the world tend to control digital trends as well. It may seem like a case of might over matter but, over the last eight years, we have fought for the attention of our clients. From a creative standpoint, strong mainline creativity needs to be adapted to the social and digital space. But that does not mean that it will work every time.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Gupta of FoxyMoron says, &ldquo;Anyone&rsquo;s first reaction to a new company is to say that &lsquo;our company is older than yours. Why should we hand over our account to you?&rsquo;. We are young and because most of us have little agency experience, we realise that we are constantly learning. Being a digital agency, we see what the customer is demanding on a real-time basis and give it to them in the voice of the brand, as opposed to a mainline message that remains the same across all media. We have to create messages in a 30-second window on a daily basis. Without sounding cocky, we can beat them at their game.&rdquo; For Khanal, training people is a challenge. &ldquo;The biggest problem is finding people to use the data analytics effectively, though this may be because the company does not have an analytics team in place yet. &ldquo;We work with training academies to help solve this problem as much as we can. Our own strong analytical base means that we can help the companies as well.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418904965.jpg" alt="Getting social" width="808" height="551" /></p>\n<p class="p3">But clients are pleased with the current regime, nonetheless. Chembath of Godrej, a client of WATConsult&rsquo;s, says, &ldquo;Being a specialised space, we realise that we needed strategy from experts. Back in 2010, offline agencies weren&rsquo;t as equipped as WATConsult and Dingra were. It helps that their involvement in our brand has the same amount of sense of ownership that we have.&rdquo; Says Shoor, &ldquo;FoxyMoron has brought a complete integrated approach to the digital space. Its ideas are not just about creating virality for the sake of it but about understanding the brand&rsquo;s bigger business objectives and making digital work towards the same end. Also, being a group of young professional themselves, they are able to think and talk like my target consumer and create ideas and campaigns that connect much better with them.&rdquo; The audience agrees &mdash; the popular crowd-sourced &lsquo;kiss&rsquo; song for Maybelline was handled by FoxyMoron.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With rising social media spends, competition in the digital and social media solutions space will only increase. There is also a strong possibility of traditional advertising agencies buying out social media players, with Publicis&rsquo; global takeover of digital agency giant Sapient for $4 billion recently.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While consolidation is still some time away as far as India is concerned, for now, digital media agencies need to find a sweet spot for themselves. Marketing consultant Anaggh Desai feels larger agencies do have the wherewithal to handle strategy well and understand the brand but are slow when it comes to turnaround time and speed of execution. &ldquo;Smaller or niche digital media agencies can turnaround much faster and are good for tactical deliveries or projects but need to have the advantage of a complete bouquet of services. There are two paths all of them have to choose &mdash; commoditisation of work (which&nbsp;today&nbsp;is 75% of the agencies) or innovative, integrated value addition work, which is the future.&rdquo; For now, though, it seems like these startups are doing a pretty good job in riding the social media wave. <span class="s1"><br /></span></p>', 'A bunch of digital media firms are going beyond conventional advertising norms to be a part of the social media revolution', '16', '', 0, '', 'not-socially-awkward-anymore-3', 1, 1, 1, 0, 16, 'Not Socially Awkward Anymore', 'A bunch of digital media firms are going beyond conventional advertising norms to be a part of the social media revolution', '', '', '', 'social media,Praveen Sinha,Jabong,WATConsult,digital marketing,online advertising,social media marketing,FoxyMoron,Simplify360', 0, NULL, '2014-12-15 17:21:50', '2015-01-06 16:54:46', '2014-11-28', 0);

What finally caught their attention &mdash; post-harvest management, a grassroots problem that haunts the Indian agricultural sector &mdash; was a far cry from what they were doing in the US. They decided to solve the huge gap in post-harvest management services by removing inefficiencies across the agri chain. This included addressing issues with a host of operations such as warehousing, logistics, procurement, collateral management and quality testing that would not only make the process more productive but also ensure better prices for farmers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In 2010, the duo decided to start Origo Commodities India to do just that. &ldquo;It was clear that the sector was ripe for some disruption since most of it was unorganised. By straddling these services together, we can help build a more efficient supply chain,&rdquo; says Mayank Dhanuka, founder, Origo Commodities.</p>\n<p class="p3">Origo is one of the latest entrants in this space. A bunch of organised players such as StarAgri, Sohanlal Commodity Management (SLCM), National Collateral Management (NCML) and Shubham Logistics are already a couple of years into the game, offering these services while leveraging the existing warehousing infrastructure to offer better storage facilities to farmers. These companies have been working on cutting through the various levels of middlemen by procuring agricultural products directly from farmers on behalf of processors, traders and government bodies, thereby ensuring better prices for farmers. They provide an entire spectrum of warehouse-management, transportation and port-handling services and help farmers transport goods from <em>mandis</em> and warehouses to their processing centres. By delivering a host of services on a single platform, these companies make it easier for corporate clients to source from them, instead of dealing with multiple entities for each service. As for the farmer, he does not have to worry about lugging his produce to various locations.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Ground reality</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">In a country where millions go hungry every day, 10% of produce goes waste due to inefficient or insufficient storage. India is one of the largest producers of agri commodities, producing 250 million metric tonne of cereals and pulses and fruits and vegetables each year. In fact, the agricultural sector makes up around 20% of India&rsquo;s GDP. Apart from millions going hungry, the monetary loss due to this wastage amounts to a staggering Rs 60,000 crore every year.</p>\n<p class="p2"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418908059.jpg" alt="The push factor" width="808" height="551" /></p>\n<p class="p3">Much of this loss can be attributed to the unorganised structure of the agri industry. For several decades now, the industry has been governed by the agricultural produce marketing committee act (APMC). There are more than 7,500 APMC <em>mandis</em> or yards across India, each with its own set of rules and regulations and covering an average area of 450 sq km. However, due to insufficient coverage and inefficient price discovery, six states have done away with APMC <em>mandis</em>. These <em>mandis</em> not only control the entire trade of agricultural goods but also have a significant bearing on the final price of the produce. In fact, the government has now allowed the creation of private <em>mandis.</em></p>\n<p class="p3">Farmers come to these <em>mandis</em> to find buyers for their produce through an auction and the price is usually determined by visual inspection. Agents and other middlemen then grade the goods; most often, this ends up fetching the farmers a lower price than what they would get if they were to sell the produce directly to the final buyers. Since the business is mostly unorganised, intermediaries that have sprung up make the price discovery inefficient.</p>\n<p class="p3">The middlemen at the&nbsp;<em>mandis</em> charge a commission from both the seller (farmer) and the buyer (trader/processor). Apart from the commission, there is also a market fee and taxes that need to be paid by the buyer. Thanks to the various levels of intermediaries, the difference between the wholesale price &mdash; which is not paid to the farmer but what goes to the middleman &mdash; and retail prices is almost more than double for most commodities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Although commission agents charge a fee, they have no facilities to grade or sort the grain and their archaic storage facilities often lead to huge post-harvest losses. Also, due to the supply glut in the market just after the harvest season, the drastic fall in prices results in farmers being unable to even cover the transport costs. Almost 6% of the food grains are stored at farmer&rsquo;s households and sold at sub-optimal prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">However, there is significant scope to improve efficiency levels and reduce wastage in this sector through better warehousing. The public sector accounts for around 72% of agri warehousing capacity and there is a gap of 35 million tonne of warehousing capacity that needs to be filled. Despite the demand-supply gap, the investment into building warehousing capacity is not flying thick and fast due to the long payback period involved. For instance, a 20,000 sq ft warehouse costs anywhere between Rs 5 crore and Rs 7 crore and it takes 8-10 years to break even on the investment with a 12-14% return, which is not very lucrative. Offering only storage facilities becomes a commoditised business since there is not much differentiation except in pricing. A majority of the service providers follow an asset-light strategy by leasing out existing warehouses. That way, companies can follow the crop pattern without making heavy investments and go through the cumbersome process of procuring land and availing clearances for construction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418908102.jpg" alt="Mayank Dhanuka" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We want to use the existing infrastructure and offer the entire spectrum of the business with the help of technology" - Mayank Dhanuka,</strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong> Director, Origo Commodities</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class="p3">So, why aren&rsquo;t larger business houses getting into the post-harvest management business if the opportunities are so lucrative? &ldquo;This is one of the most operationally tough businesses to be in,&rdquo; says Origo&rsquo;s Dhanuka. &ldquo;It involves dealing with a lot of middlemen and manpower, besides building a network both on the buyers&rsquo; and the suppliers&rsquo; side. And with a lot of services being interlinked, timely execution is very critical. The existing players are unable to leverage technology and not all of them have the bandwidth to provide the entire spectrum of services. So we want to use the existing infrastructure and offer the entire spectrum of the business with the help of technology,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Sowing the seeds</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Currently, Origo has 500 warehouses and more than 1,000 employees, with a revenue of around Rs 150 crore. The number is expected to double in the next financial year. The company is looking to create around 20 integrated service centres, which will cost about #5 crore-15 crore depending on the location and size. While around Rs 50 crore-75 crore will come from internal accruals, the company is looking to raise money from private equity funds as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">When players such as StarAgri and&nbsp; SLCM started their operations six to seven years ago, the companies had to win over the trust of farmers to use their services. In the larger <em>mandis</em>, post-harvest companies have employed registered representatives who directly source from the farmers. StarAgri identified a few farmers in Rajasthan and worked with the company closely to sell the idea of working with the company for a commission. Their strategy of breaking into the rural community has paid off, with the company now having a direct relationship with 300,000 farmers across the country.</p>\n<p class="p3">These companies also work closely with banks to disburse loans and help with documentation, earning a fee on both the loan origination and collateral management. Farmers can also opt to hold the goods for three to four months and sell it at better prices if they choose to. They can also receive credit against the warehousing receipts from banks and financial institutions. Access to warehousing helps farmers avoid distress sales of their produce during the harvest season. &ldquo;For banks, too, it is the ideal way to meet their priority sector lending requirements,&rdquo; says Girish Nadkarni, partner at IDFC Alternatives, who pegs the opportunity at Rs 100,000 crore and believes that &ldquo;there is potential for exponential growth in the business since the annual agri production is over #8 lakh crore.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418908505.jpg" alt="Girish Nadkarni" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"There is potential for exponential growth in the business since the annual agri production is over Rs 8 lakh crore" - Girish Nadkarni, Partner, </strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>IDFC Alternatives-Private Equity</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class="p3">IDFC Alternatives first ventured into agri services when it invested Rs 150 crore in StarAgri in February 2012. Headquartered in Jaipur, StarAgri was founded in 2006 by Suresh Goyal, Amit Khandelwal, Amit Mundawala and Amith Agarwal, who were then associates at ICICI Bank, helping farmers get financing. Between them, they have years of experience in financing, procurement, warehousing and being commission agents. When the idea occurred to them, they had just the perfect match of skills required to start a post-harvest management company. They even spent time with each other&rsquo;s families for a week to see if they could work as a team. The foursome found that their value systems were similar and decided to start StarAgri. The company has come a long way since then: it operates 1,200 warehouses across 300 locations with a total warehousing capacity of 1.7 million tonne. Its collateral management portfolio has grown from Rs 500 crore in 2012 to Rs 9,000 crore currently and it has tied up with 35 banks to provide collateral financing to farmers. It also raised Rs 250 crore earlier this year from Singapore-based company Temasek to expand its agri warehouse network and develop private <em>mandis</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">StarAgri is looking to create five private <em>mandis</em> in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh where warehousing, procurement, testing and grading facilities will be provided under the same roof, making things easier for the farmer. Earlier, they had to first go to the <em>mandi</em> and then shift the goods to warehouses. The current process allows for better price discovery since the NCDEX terminal will live stream the prices of commodities. With one <em>mandi</em> already operational, four others will be functional by mid-December. Once the initial <em>mandis</em> gain some traction, the company&rsquo;s intention is to create 50 private <em>mandis</em> in a couple of years. It will invest in building silo-based storages, used for bulk storage based on international standards, and mechanised sorting and technology to ensure real-time inventory and risk management. The company clocked revenue of Rs 110 crore in FY14 and is expected to almost double it to Rs 200 crore in FY15, driven by its expanding agri logistics network. Almost two-thirds of its revenue comes from warehousing and the rest from procurement, testing and logistics.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418909166.jpg" alt="Star Agri Team" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Stock in trade: (L-R) Amit Khandelwal, Amit Mundawala,&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">For Sandeep Sabharwal, joining his family&rsquo;s food processing business was a natural choice after finishing his MBA from Delhi University in 1995. A decade into the business, he realised that apart from trading and processing, there was little being done to improve storage efficiency and reduce wastage in the existing warehouse system. So he set up SLCM in 2008 &mdash; from a single warehouse location in 2009, the company currently handles nearly 600 warehouses and nine cold storages with 1.55 million tonne of storage capacity across 20 states in the country. &ldquo;When I started out and mooted the idea of using technology to improve efficiency across warehouses, many existing warehouse owners told me that I had no clue about the business. But with our standard operating procedure, we have been able to prove that we can considerably improve storage efficiency,&rdquo; says Sandeep Sabharwal, CEO, SLCM.</p>\n<p class="p3">SLCM has invested in technology to set up a centralised management information system that has real-time information on the multi-location holdings of customers. It has also come up with its own SOP called Agrireach &mdash; that it is looking to patent &mdash; that significantly brings down wastage during storage. One of the major reasons for wastage is theft and the company has come up with a process that not only reduces theft but also checks the quality of the food grains. It has a bar-coded warehouse system wherein customers can track the movement of their products. &ldquo;Using bar codes, customers can track purchases right from the time they enter the warehouse till they leave in trucks,&rdquo; explains Sabharwal. The process includes quality checks and monitoring moisture levels on a daily or weekly basis.

In May 2010, Nexus Venture Partners made their first investment of Rs 10 crore in the company. Thanks to the challenges Suminter Organics &mdash; one of its portfolio companies &mdash; faced while sourcing, Nexus was aware of the gaps in post-harvest supply chain management. &ldquo;We were looking for a company that addressed challenges in the farm-to-production logistics space and decided to back Sabharwal because he was focused on using technology to build softer infrastructure that improves the overall efficiency,&rdquo; says Sandeep Singhal, managing partner, Nexus Venture Partners.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In the next round of funding in March 2011, Mayfield India and Nexus Venture Partners pumped in another Rs 35.5 crore for expansion. The company raised its third round of funding from Everstone Capital and Emerging India Fund (a fund under&nbsp;ICICI Bank), where the funds invested Rs 129 crore. At present, investors hold a nearly 74% stake in the company. SLCM is looking to foray into markets similar to India such as Myanmar and Africa, where it can replicate the business model. With revenue of Rs 1,100 crore in FY15, the company hopes to clock revenue of Rs 1,800 crore in FY16 as it expands its capacity across the country.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The company made its foray into the warehouse receipt financing arena by acquiring Chennai-based NBFC and launching its product KissanDhan in April 2014 and currently has a loan book of Rs 50 crore. StarAgri and Origo are also starting their own financing arms to finance farmers in areas where banks and financial institutions don&rsquo;t have operations. &ldquo;The financing business lends itself to the other services offered. Since we already have a network in place and the collateral is in our warehouses, we are leveraging our existing assets to add an additional revenue stream,&rdquo; says Amith Agarwal, director, StarAgri.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">These organised players form less than 5% of the total market, with the government making up for three-fourths of the market. While some of them are creating infrastructure in places where there are good occupancy rates and are setting up smart <em>mandis</em>, most of them are leveraging the existing infrastructure to improve the <br /> efficiency of warehouses and reducing wastage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">By straddling procurement, testing, logistics and financing, the companies are now generating additional revenue streams to improve their returns in a business that is more or less commoditised. As post-harvest management services move to being more organised, it would only mean more opportunities for these companies, helping them sustain their current growth rates. <span class="s1"><br /></span></p>', 'How a bunch of private players are looking to plug a serious gap and create value in India’s agri supply chain', '6', '', 0, '8a726a0236ef0a3579f61270b98486f1.jpg', 'a-storehouse-of-growth-4', 2, 1, 1, 0, 16, 'A Storehouse Of Growth', 'How a bunch of private players are looking to plug a serious gap and create value in India’s agri supply chain', '', '', '', 'Agriculture,post harvest,Origo Commodities,StarAgri,Sohanlal Commodity Management,mandis,APMC,farmer,IDFC Alternatives,warehouse,Nexus Venture Partners', 0, NULL, '2014-12-15 17:30:37', '2014-12-18 19:07:54', '2014-11-28', 0),

(7, 16, '', 'Changing With The Times', '<p class="p1">On days when he&rsquo;s looking for some inspiration, Shital Mehta steps out of his narrow office space on the seventh floor of a tower in downtown Mumbai and out onto the shop floor. On the balmy Friday afternoon when we met the forty-two-year-old CEO of retail apparel firm Pantaloons to discuss the company&rsquo;s growth strategies, Mehta decided to make the trek uptown to its High Street Phoenix mall outlet, which was hosting a weekly event for the brand. With Bollywood music booming over the speakers, excited shoppers posing with mannequins and nearly 50,000 sq ft of branded merchandise such as apparel, perfume and sunglasses, the outlet was making the most of its location at the rejuvenated mill district of the city. Clearly, Pantaloons &mdash; which counts Lifestyle and Shoppers Stop as neighbours in the Rs 499 to Rs 6,000 category at this mall &mdash; is slowly trying to erase its creator&rsquo;s stamp to make a definite statement in the market: &ldquo;We are here to make a difference, to carve out a distinct identity by positioning our brands somewhere between the premium and mass categories,&rdquo; says Mehta, an engineering graduate and a native of Gujarat, who entered the retail fashion industry in 2000 when he joined Madura Lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">As it happens, some of these transformations are visible in Pantaloons&rsquo; new stores across India. There are, for instance, several exclusive brands in its kitty, Louis Philippe, Van Heusen, Allen Solly, Peter England to the fairly recent The Collective. The chain has changed its tagline from &lsquo;Fresh Fashion&rsquo; to &lsquo;In Love with Fashion&rsquo;, rolling out a new campaign across the digital and print media and outdoor advertising to upgrade the brand&rsquo;s imagery. And the results are quite evident &mdash; according to Mehta, the High Street Phoenix store alone has seen a 15% sales growth for Q1FY15 and a #10-crore increase in sales since the rollout of the brand&rsquo;s new identity last December.</p>\n<p class="p3">Though there is enough scope for growth &mdash; apparel accounts for just 8% ($40 billion) of the Indian retail market &mdash; competition is rife with Shoppers Stop, Lifestyle and Westside and others vying for supremacy. All these retail majors face some key challenges &mdash; the heterogeneity of the market, evolving customer needs, and rising real estate rentals. With this diverse retail landscape abuzz with players in high fashion space, can the new owners help Pantaloons succeed in creating a niche for itself?</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Stitching it together</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Rewind to 2012, when Birla first noticed the declining state of the retail behemoth and the high debt burden borne by Biyani. The group decided to acquire Pantaloons Retail through a two-stage deal involving an Rs 800-crore cash payment, assumption of a similar amount of debt and an open offer of a minimum 26% to shareholders of the de-merged Pantaloons format-owning company. What prompted the deal? According to Mehta, the answer is the synergy benefits between Pantaloons and Birla&rsquo;s Madura Fashion &amp; Lifestyle, as the combined business will cater to the entire value chain of consumers &mdash; from the value-conscious middle class to top-end customers. Aditya Birla Nuvo, the parent, now has a presence across retail lifestyle chain. While Madura Fashion retails and distributes top-of-the-mind-recall brands, which include names such as Louis Phillipe, Van Heusen, Allen Solly and Peter England; Jayshree Textiles is into high-end linen and wool; and now Pantaloons has given the group a presence in retail apparel chain. One of the first steps taken by the Birlas after the deal was to synergise the operations of Madura Fashion &amp; Lifestyle and Pantaloons &mdash; they brought in a number of Madura employees, which includes CEO Mehta. In a career spanning two decades, Mehta has worked with several big names, including Madura, Godrej Foods and ITW Signode.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: top;" title="Pantaloons 1" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420544025.jpg" alt="" width="808" height="551" />&ldquo;Birla is one of the biggest apparel players. Since Pantaloons operates in a completely complimentary space &mdash; at a group level &mdash; we felt it was a good fit. It has everything that Madura lacks,&rdquo; said Mehta. While Pantaloons gets Madura&rsquo;s menswear exclusive brands, Birla has also brought in a new sales channel. Also, Pantaloons&rsquo; experienced management team is helping provide Aditya Birla the requisite skills and execution capabilities to achieve its growth aspirations, according to Mehta. He still remembers the freezing Bengaluru afternoon when, just as he was about to leave for the even colder east Canada region for an eighteen-month official trip, he received a circular from chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla. The circular featured details of the management changes at Pantaloons, including Mehta&rsquo;s promotion as the CEO of Pantaloons Fashion Retail, then a Rs 1,600-crore listed enterprise. The next call was from Mehta&rsquo;s boss &mdash; Ashish Dikshit, then CEO of Madura Fashion &amp; Lifestyle. The excitement was palpable, as this gave Mehta the opportunity to focus on building the organisation, improve scale and revenue and make it more profitable.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">So, how is the Birla group transforming Pantaloons? After taking over the company in 2012-13, the new management has focused on some key areas &mdash; rebuilding the organisation, expanding customer reach, enhancing productivity of the existing stores, strengthening the brand portfolio and optimising finance costs. To strengthen manpower, the company rebuilt the organisation by hiring executives at key critical positions across the design, merchandise, finance and human resource departments. In the last one year alone, the company has hired 230 employees, of which 40 are designers from India&rsquo;s top 10 companies. It also changed nearly half of the 200 vendors Pantaloons had earlier engaged with and has retained the ones that offer scalability and specialisation.</p>\n<p class="p3">The Birlas roped in retail veteran Nagesh C as the new head of design and visual merchandising at Pantaloons. Thirty-nine-year-old Nagesh was given the mandate to focus on three things: building a design studio and create a space for design thinking and aesthetics, develop a brand handwriting to help bring back focus on the core ingredients of the brand and to conduct brand architecture. Though he went about setting up a design studio and assigned two to three designers to each brand, there were several key drawbacks Nagesh felt he had to contend with &mdash; a lack of understanding of fashion and trends, outdated brands and a laidback approach to design. Very few fashion-conscious new customers could be seen coming into the stores, he explains. Apart from places such as Kolkata, where people have an emotional connect with the brand, the chain seemed to be losing its charm in bigger cities, says Nagesh. Hence, his first task was to identify contemporary trends in women&rsquo;s, men&rsquo;s and kids wear and bring back the brand&rsquo;s competitive spirit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">A new design philosophy soon took shape &mdash; being trendy, relevant to the market, global in thinking but local in execution and being aware of trends, yet catering to local sensibilities. In short, the company was trying to be more adaptable and to acclimatise itself to a changed India that is not only dynamic and consumerist but also demands the best. Key brands today include Annabelle (formal and evening wear for women), Honey (casual wear), sports lifestyle brand Ajile and ethnic <em>kurtas</em> from Rangmanch and Akkriti. Moreover, Nagesh&rsquo;s team also designs all Pantaloons stores to extend the same design inspiration and lend them the same identity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Changing mix</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Since the acquisition, the company has been expanding its store presence to penetrate newer markets and reach out to more customers. It launched 14 new Pantaloons stores and one factory outlet in 2013, taking the total count to 81 Pantaloons stores and 26 factory outlets. The average size of a Pantaloons store is around 23,000 sq ft; the store size could vary between 11,000 and 80,000 sq ft depending on the city, location and target market size. Pantaloons span a retail space of about two million sq ft, among the largest in India in the organised fashion retail segment. With an aim of improving customer footfalls and enhancing profitable sales growth in existing stores, 22 outlets were refurbished during 2013 through infrastructure and assortment upgrades.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Mehta claims that the group&rsquo;s endeavor is to transform Pantaloons from a private label-driven chain to a chain featuring exclusive products. &ldquo;We will no longer be mediocre. We provide modern shopping experiences in the price range of #199 to Rs 5,000,&rdquo; says Mehta. Or, to put it more bluntly, Mehta explains, the company now positions its products as elegant and classy, rather than just featuring cheap, retailer-manufactured products tucked away in the corners of the stores. While the split between its exclusive and partner brands is around 55:45, the exclusive brands share is set to spike to 60% by next year, says Nagesh. Moreover, says Mehta, there is an attempt to make trendy clothes while still retaining affordability, with an inflationary price increase of 5-6%. &ldquo;Our strategy is not to shift pricing. We want affordability to be a constant factor in our business,&rdquo; he adds. For instance, the company&rsquo;s denim jeans, which are on offer for Rs 1,999 for two pairs, were earlier selling for Rs 1,899 for two.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Over the last one year, the company has exited categories such as toys, home d&eacute;cor and electronics to make stores clutter-free. It has also minimised the share of diamond jewellery in the store. To emerge as an exclusive brands destination, Pantaloons has also strengthened the high-margin private labels portfolio, with three new brand launches &mdash; Byford for men&rsquo;s sportswear, Alto Moda in the plus-size category and Chirpie Pie for infants. The company built these new brands and popularised them through both mass media and in-store promotions. Its strategy was aimed at enriching the product portfolio, thereby, improving gross margins. To widen its menswear segment, the company started retailing Madura&rsquo;s leading brands Louis Philippe, Van Heusen, Allen Solly and Peter England.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">According the company&rsquo;s latest annual report, Pantaloons sells approximately 400 brands across segments, a mix of private labels, licensed brands and other brands. Some brands are also retailed under the shop-in-shop format, where Pantaloons charges fixed rentals or fixed margins. Private labels and licensed brands contribute to close to 50% of the company&rsquo;s sales. These comprise own brands such as Akkriti, Rangmanch, Ajile, Annabelle, Trisha, Honey and Chalk, as well as brands licensed on a perpetual basis from Future Group. The balance sales are contributed by other apparel and non-apparel brands. &ldquo;While our intention is to push all our brands, going forward, our women&rsquo;s business is likely to get stronger. From what used to be 38%, women&rsquo;s wear now accounts for around 42% of the business. By next year, the share should increase to 45%,&rdquo; says Mehta. Pantaloons just signed a licensing deal with American women&rsquo;s clothing brand Candie&rsquo;s, which is targeted towards 16-24 year old young girls and is ranked among the bestsellers at departmental store chain Kohl&rsquo;s in the US. Over the last one year, Mehta says the company has also done away with around 15-16 non-performing brands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418911191.jpg" alt="Nagesh C" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Unlike our peers, we are trying to give a distinct brand identity to each of our brands by positioning them sharply" - Nagesh C, Head design</strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong> &amp; visual merchandising, Pantaloons</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class="p3">It helps that just 55% of Pantaloons&rsquo; business comes from exclusive brands, says Nagesh. &ldquo;Unlike our peers, we try to give a distinct brand identity to each of our brands and position them sharply, whereas our rival brands often commoditise their merchandise. In terms of shelf space, we try to give visibility to exclusive and ethnic-wear brands,&rdquo; says Nagesh. Pantaloons&rsquo; real estate strategy is also different from its competition. Mehta says the company wants to set up stores either in emerging tier 1 cities, such as Kammanahalli in Bengaluru, or be the first mover in tier 2 towns such as Muzaffarnagar in UP, Jamshedpur and Shillong in the east or Guntur in the south. Typically, 10-12% of retailer costs go towards rentals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Expansion binge</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The retail chain claims to be reaping the rewards of its efforts. According to Mehta, bill value has improved by around 30% in Q1FY15 as people are buying more and buying better. In the men&rsquo;s apparel segment, year-on-year sales growth has increased by 10%. In the first quarter alone, the company has seen a 20% increase in sales among their top-tier loyalty customers. Net sales also rose 13.47% to Rs 381.30 crore in Q1FY15 over Q1FY13. Pantaloons is also seeing strong growth from the eastern region, which contributes to around one-third of its total revenue, followed by north, west and then south. In fact, in the last four months, 90% of its stock was sold out, says Mehta. During the same period, year-on-year growth increased by 8%, while bill value increased by 10%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Going ahead, Pantaloons plans to overhaul all of its stores by summer 2015. From 83 stores across 40 cities, the company plans to double its store count in tier 2 and 3 cities across the country over the next two years. Given that each such company-owned store will cost Rs 18-20 crore, the per-year investment for expansion is in the Rs 150-crore range, says Mehta. &ldquo;We have the advantage of financial muscle and the experience of building brands. What we want is to build on the inherent qualities of Pantaloons, which are costing, affordability and the ability to offer affordable fashionable items in a modern store format,&rdquo; says Mehta.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Abneesh Roy, associate director, Edelweiss Capital says, &ldquo;Pantaloons will have to change its product mix to offer more accessories to its new, young customers in order to move up the value chain, increase footfalls and compete with rivals.&rdquo; Though increasing footfalls is a key area of concern, Mehta does not want to enter accessories. &ldquo;It is a low-margin business. We want to remain focused on one category and be the best in it, which is why we are pushing the focus on apparel,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Nabankur Gupta, founder and CEO of Nobby Brand Architects &amp; Strategic Marketing Consultants, feels the transition from value to premium might be a tough journey for the group. &ldquo;The premium space is already crowded with players such as Shoppers Stop and Lifestyle. Moreover, they offer a wider variety of products to customers. Pantaloons would really have to give retail a special treatment to get bang for the buck,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;Pantaloons under the Biyanis was never really a player in the value segment. It always offered high-quality private label brands at reasonable prices. And the stores would always look plush and high-end,&rdquo; argues a Pantaloons ex-employee on condition of anonymity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418910958.jpg" alt="Nabankur Gupta" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Pantaloons would have to give retail a special treatment to get bang for the buck" - Nabankur Gupta, Founder and CEO, Nobby Brand&nbsp;</strong><strong>Architects &amp; Strategic Marketing Consultants</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">But Mehta is taking no chances. To make the shopping experience more interesting, Pantaloons plans to appoint 10 experience officers or fashion consultants across 10 cities to provide fashion tips to customers. &ldquo;Our customers aspire to live better and wear better clothes but do not have the exposure needed. So we came up with this plan to help them. For now, this is a pilot project, to be rolled out over the next two months,&rdquo; says Mehta.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">To provide a better brand experience to its customers, Pantaloons is also joining the online bandwagon with Trendin.com, an online platform launched by the Aditya Birla group a year-and-a-half ago to retail its Madura brands. &ldquo;We plan to make an online foray over the next two months. This is nothing but an extension of our physical retail stores. Like other online players, we will provide free home delivery to our customers and follow up with discounts at our retail stores. The investment for this space is only in terms of marketing,&rdquo; Mehta says. He refused to divulge details on the investment required for the project.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420544721.jpg" alt="Pantaloons 2" width="808" height="551" />To ensure a high brand recall, the company is currently working with Vyas Giannetti Creative, a Mumbai-based design and creative communication firm. It is still early days though. On sales of Rs 1,661 crore in FY14, the retail apparel chain is still in the red with a loss of #188 crore, which increased from Rs 69 crore in the previous fiscal owing to more hiring and renovation costs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">As of now, Mehta seems content with his strategies and their results. In 1999, Birla had entered fashion retail with the acquisition of Madura for Rs 236 crore. Today, Madura Lifestyle enjoys the highest return on capital employed (RoCE) in the industry. IT is growing from 20% in FY12 to 65% in FY14. Pantaloons&rsquo; RoCE of 9% just goes to show that there is a long way for the Birlas to go. But Mehta, who was instrumental in turning around Madura, is not too perturbed. &ldquo;From my days at Madura, and much before that, I would always set myself a target of around five years to achieve my goals. That way, you are consistently working towards the target and achieving it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a big challenge,&rdquo; he sums up.&nbsp;</p>', 'The new owners of Pantaloons are keen to erase the retailer’s legacy of affordable fashion by moving up the value chain and setting up more and more stores.

(8, 16, '', 'Looking Beyond Tobacco', '<p class="p1"><strong>"We are not top line- or bottom line obsessed. We enter businesses where we see value and where we can add value" - Rajiv Kumar, Vice-chairman and MD, DS Group</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">There is no denying that business histories are rarely documented, let alone in print, so a museum that chronicles a renowned company&rsquo;s tumultuous history was till recently a far-fetched idea. This is where the experiential DS Museum started by the Dharampal Satyapal (DS) Group has scored a major first, recounting the grassroots-to-major-group transition of the entity, covering its diverse interests, from tobacco, mouth fresheners, confectionery, food and beverage and dairy -&mdash; its core businesses &mdash; to latex, agroforestry, packaging, hospitality and infrastructure &mdash; its emerging businesses. Started by Dharampal in 1929 as a tobacco business, the group, which many of us now associate with the Catch spices label, counts Rajnigandha and Baba among the prime building blocks of its emerging empire.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Indian digestives have taken a beating in recent years, so the idea of using a museum to bring the brand&rsquo;s story alive &mdash; from the colourful streets of Chandni Chowk in Delhi to the founder&rsquo;s laboratory, painstakingly detailed with life-like marionettes and the original accouterments of Satyapal&rsquo;s office &mdash; is heightened with dramatic possibilities. Satyapal was responsible for steering the fledgling company towards quality, research and its early experiments with branding. Audiences love rags-to-riches stories and there&rsquo;s enough of that here to endear the company to the small groups that have permission to visit the museum, which is located on the group&rsquo;s office premises. Similar museums at the Akshardham Temple, also in the capital, and the Khalsa Museum at Anantpur Sahib have used comparable tropes, but DS distinguishes itself by providing a more intimate experience to the audience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">For this purpose, visitors enter through a &lsquo;fragrant forest&rsquo; where lights and aromas are triggered by the visitor&rsquo;s footsteps, a kind of tactile experience unexplored in India so far. In the next section, a theatrical dramatisation of the group&rsquo;s founders is used as an emotional hook to retain interest in the two remaining zones, which are built around the group&rsquo;s aspirational vision and the range of products manufactured in its state-of-the-art factories. Though the museum is not yet open for the general public, it may not be long before it is: the Rs 4,800-crore group has a story to tell and it has done so with poignant vigour, something other companies may do well to emulate.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Changing shape</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">It was during Satyapal&rsquo;s era that the group firmly ensconced itself in a highly commoditised category like tobacco by pioneering the branded chewing and <em>paan</em> masala market in the country. Lala Satyapal had realised in the late &rsquo;50s that branding was critical for the company&rsquo;s survival. The inception of the company&rsquo;s first brand was just as fortuitous &mdash; Satyapal was walking around Connaught Place in 1958 when he came across a small laughing Buddha statue in a shop. Enamoured by the image, he got an artist to redraw the figure, albeit wearing a <em>doshala</em> and <em>tilak</em>. In 1969, graced with image, the first product from the company&rsquo;s stables <em>&mdash;</em> Baba &mdash; was introduced, also holding the distinction of being the first-ever branded chewing tobacco product in India. Soon, new brands such as Tulsi in 1979 &mdash; to mark the 50th anniversary of the business &mdash; and Rajnigandha were created. Satyapal found the name apt because it was a sweet-smelling flower that had a popular film song dedicated to it, ensuring easy recall among the audience. The Catch brand name, inspired by a one-off cricket match, was also his brainchild.</p>\n<p class="p2"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418913004.jpg" alt="Something to chew on" width="808" height="551" /></p>\n<p class="p3">After ruling the tobacco and <em>paan</em> masala market in the &rsquo;70s and the &rsquo;80s, the group diversified into the food business with Catch salt shakers in 1987, followed by Catch spices. Since then, the group has been entering new market segments quite regularly &mdash; packaging (with Canpac), spring water (Catch), mouth fresheners (Pass Pass), rubber (Uniflex), hospitality (Manu Maharani in Nainital), agroforestry (in the northeast) and dairy (Dairybest and Ksheer). The diversification has largely been driven by Satyapal&rsquo;s two sons, group chairman Ravinder Kumar and Rajiv Kumar, who is the face of the group. The group&rsquo;s turnover currently stands at rs 4,894 crore and they hope to be a billion dollar company by the end of FY15. Putting the expansion in perspective, 52-year-old Rajiv, VC and MD, DS Group explains, &ldquo;We are not top line- or bottom line-obsessed. We enter businesses where we see value and where we can add value. Though some of them are niche categories, in a country of a billion, that translates into numbers equaling the population of European countries such as Switzerland.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">The diversification is not without reason. Tobacco companies the world over try to break free from the negative image associated with tobacco consumption and dependence on tobacco products. The group, too, has spread its basket with this aim. The constant focus on reducing dependence on tobacco has meant that it today contributes just 25% to revenue. &ldquo;At its peak, tobacco, along with <em>paan</em> masala, made up for the group&rsquo;s entire revenue in late &rsquo;80s. But that&rsquo;s no longer the case today,&rdquo; points out Rajiv. Though the tobacco business brings in a sizeable Rs 1,262 crore in revenue and has been instrumental in making the group cash-rich over the past four decades, it is mouth fresheners &mdash; mainly the flagship Rajnigandha <em>paan</em> masala &mdash; that contribute 40%, or over #2,334 crore, to the group&rsquo;s top line. &ldquo;Though tobacco is not likely to be banned in the foreseeable future, we chose to work on healthier alternatives as well,&rdquo; he explains.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Making a mark</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Though the group&rsquo;s journey seems starkly similar to the way tobacco major ITC remodeled its business to emerge as an FMCG-to-hospitality conglomerate, Rajiv disagrees with this observation. &ldquo;It is the media that compares us with ITC. There are so many businesses where we are present and they are not, and vice versa. Our diversification is our natural progression,&rdquo; he emphasises. In others words, the group consciously chooses to stay away from the personal care segment and food categories such as wheat flour. Instead, it is now betting on FMCG businesses through its DS Foods subsidiary, banking on its existing strong sales and distribution channels that have been hawking salt and spices for decades. The group has chosen to enter niche categories with a premium positioning attached to them. &ldquo;Premiumisation is in our DNA. My father would travel all the way to Kashmiri farms to ensure that the right quality of saffron was being supplied to us,&rdquo; points out Rajiv. The habit of getting the right ingredients has been crafted into a business strategy for the premium positioning of its mouth fresheners.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;It is a choice that each company makes. However, my opinion is that if you are committed to building a brand from the very beginning, then instead of competing on the price front with generic products, it is best to start with a premium brand. The additional margin available can be invested in strengthening the brand and its product attributes. The premium itself can serve as a vehicle to establish a difference from the competition,&rdquo; says Devangshu Dutta, chief executive, Third Eyesight. As early as 1987, much before the consumerism wave hit India, the group entered the foods space by going premium with table salt. Today, it has found its sweet spot in the dining condiment arena with its free-flowing table salt and pepper shakers under the Catch brand, which is today worth Rs 400 crore. Though Tata came out with its own brand of shakers, Catch continues to dominate the salt and spices shaker category. At Rs 15 for 100 gm, Catch is costlier than ordinary packaged salt. &ldquo;In the table shaker category, we perhaps hold 99% market share,&rdquo; points out OP Khanduja, associate business head, food business, DS Group. Similarly, In 1999, it launched bottled water by positioning Catch Natural Spring Water as having been bottled at source in the Himalayas. At #53 crore per year, the brand today accounts for a lion&rsquo;s share in the bottled spring water market.&ldquo;The demand for Catch Natural Spring Water is more than the supply, given that the number of springs in the Himalayas is limited,&rdquo; points out Bhavna Sood, senior vice-president, DS Group.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418912863.jpg" alt="OP Khanduja" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"In the table shaker category, we (Catch Salt &amp; Spices) perhaps hold around 99% of the entire market" - O P Khanduja, Associate business head, DS Group</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class="p3">The premium plank has worked well within the group&rsquo;s flagship business too. The total size of the <em>paan</em> masala industry is worth Rs 27,000 crore, with the premium segment accounting for Rs 2,800 crore. Of this, Rajnigandha holds close to 80% share. CK Sharma, business head, mouth freshener, who handles the Rajnigandha portfolio, says, &ldquo;Over the past couple of years, the rural-urban divide has narrowed, with an increasing preference for branded products. This reflects in our sales.&rdquo; As a result, the Rajnigandha business has seen an astronomical spurt in size last year (from Rs 1,300 crore to Rs 2,334 crore). Besides an aggressive TV commercial strategy, the company kept consumer interest alive by introducing several variants, with the latest &mdash; Rajnigandha Silver Pearls &mdash; being introduced in convenient plastic packs.</p>\n<p class="p3">What is also working in favour of the mouth freshener category is the <em>gutka</em> ban in 26 states since 2012, which Rajnigandha <em>paan</em> masala seems to have benefited from. Sharma says the brand has tried to steer clear of <em>gutka</em> &mdash; a banned product that could tarnish its clean image. &ldquo;Based on consumer demand, we did manufacture <em>gutka</em> in the past but were not that successful. However, after the ban, we have abided by the law and stopped manufacturing <em>gutka</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Though consumers have simply shifted to mixing <em>paan</em> masala with chewing tobacco (both of which are available as the company&rsquo;s products) after <em>gutka</em> was banned, Sharma believes that this is not what is driving Rajnigandha <em>paan</em> masala&rsquo;s sales. &ldquo;People consume <em>paan</em> masala in a variety of ways but largely as a mouth freshener. There is no correlation between the rise in the sales of Rajnigandha and the <em>gutka</em> ban; the former is due to expansion and focus on rural penetration.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Keeping in line with its expansion, the group entered the dairy business in 2011 with the acquisition of a plant in Rajasthan, including an institutional brand called Dairy Max. Two years later, it forayed into the premium dairy segment with ultra high temperature (UHT) processed milk and cow&rsquo;s ghee under the newly launched Ksheer brand. With only a handful of players such as Nestle (GLYPH), Mother Dairy, Amul and Parag Milk present in the Rs 2,000-crore high quality and long shelf life UHT premium segment, the group chose its positioning carefully, with industry forecasts predicting the UHT milk market to grow at 20% annually. Rajiv claims that even with stiff competition, the initial results have been satisfying. &ldquo;The dairy business has grown from Rs 30 crore in FY13 to Rs 111 crore in FY14 but it will be at least three-four years before cold chain infrastructure comes into place and we are able to realise its potential with new products,&rdquo; he adds. The group is now looking at revenue of Rs 300 crore from the dairy business by 2016.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Network connections</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The group has managed to create a sizeable FMCG business as it has leveraged and ramped up its existing distribution network. Sharma says, &ldquo;From 8 lakh retailers, we have reached 10 lakh in two years and have entered new towns and villages. Perhaps, we enjoy the highest retail reach after ITC,&rdquo; mentions Sharma. The retail penetration is an outcome of its revamped distribution strategy that resulted in the number of depots increasing from 24 to 30 with 160 super distributors and close to 1,400 sub-distributors covering close to 9,500 villages.</p>\n<p class="p2"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418913079.jpg" alt="CK Sharma" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"From 8 lakh retailers, we have reached 10 lakh in two years and have entered new towns and villages" - C K Sharma, Business head, DS Group</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class="p3">The deeper penetration coupled with changing consumer preferences has worked in favour of the group. In case of mouth fresheners, DS was a strong player in northern and western markets, but not in south, which is what it is trying to change. &ldquo;Pass Pass is our carrier brand in the south and we are leveraging our distribution and reach, to place Rajnigandha <em>paan</em> masala and other products in kiosks in the south,&rdquo; says Sharma. The group is convincing retailers for better display of their brands. &ldquo;If a retailer earns Rs 500 and Rs 250 comes from our products, we can influence space management in his shop,&rdquo; adds Sharma.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Consumption is rising rapidly in the higher income segments where availability and branding are greater drivers of product off-take than price-based competition. Most FMCG companies in India are under-penetrated with regard to distribution. Perhaps about 20% of the market is unserviced even for a market leader such as Hindustan Unilever; for other companies that figure is far higher. So increasing a brand&rsquo;s availability across geography and penetration within the locations already serviced are avenues of future growth&rdquo; says Dutta on DS group&rsquo;s expansion plans.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418913243.jpg" alt="Devangshu Dutta" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Increasing the brand''s availability and penetration within serviced locations are avenues to growth" - Devanshu Dutta, Chief executive, Third Eyesight</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class="p3">In the case of Catch salt &amp; spices business, which has grown over 30% over the past two years, the retail reach has gone up from 1.5 lakh outlets to 2 lakh outlets. &ldquo;We revamped our reach in southern and eastern markets where we were weak, and outsourced part of our production,&rdquo; points out Sharma. In case of the spices business, the group is focusing on all sales channels &mdash; general and modern trade, and restaurants and catering. Though there are several regional players and MDH and Everest dominate the general trade, Khanduja points out that they lack a national focus unlike the DS group.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>The way ahead</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Over the past five years, the group has trebled its turnover of Rs 600 crore with a diversified portfolio. By going that extra mile, it stands separate from other homegrown peers such as Kothari Products (Pan Parag) and Dhariwal Industries (RMD Gutka). Says Sood, &ldquo;We are a privately held company but our accounting practises are at par with that of a public company. We aren&rsquo;t required to present annual reports but we do. We are transparent and follow best practices.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Today, the group garners more than a fourth of its revenue from food and beverage products and intends things to remain that way. Industry experts believe that given the competitive landscape, the DS Group has its task cut out. &ldquo;The biggest challenge for them is how to get blockbuster brands. Catch is only one brand; they have to look at a much broader horizon and launch fresh brands in other categories such as processed food, chocolate or chips, the way ITC has progressed,&rdquo; says Harminder Sahni of Wazir Advisors. But Rajiv has a different plan and doesn&rsquo;t believe that the group needs to create fresh brands in multiple categories. &ldquo;Catch will be like an umbrella brand &mdash; like Nestle &mdash; and sub-brands such as Catch Ksheer or Catch Piyoz (powdered beverages) will make space for themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">However, getting market share is not that easy. In case of Catch spices, DS&rsquo; market share is hardly 7-8%, even after two decades in the business. The Rs 6,000-crore spice market has two major players &mdash; MDH and Everest &mdash; and numerous regional players. Catch is a premium but niche player. But Rajiv is willing to be patient. &ldquo;MDH is 80 years old, Everest 50 years old, so our brand too needs time to come of age,&rdquo; he feels. Nevertheless, the group is doing all it takes to create a buzz around its products, including celebrity advertising; actress Vidya Balan endorses its spices brand. While FMCG is a core part of the group&rsquo;s strategy, its blueprint for the hospitality industry is taking shape. After acquiring a 67-room hotel &mdash; Manu Maharani &mdash; at Nainital in 2000, DS is ready for a second round of expansion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;We acquired our first hotel fifteen years ago and have learnt the basics of the hospitality business. It&rsquo;s only now that four of our properties are coming up at Kolkata, Jaipur, Guwahati and Jim Corbett National Park,&rdquo; Rajiv adds. With close to 1,000 rooms, the new properties will be a mix of budget and star hotels and will be largely funded through internal accruals. Though the group seems to be aping the ITC growth model, Kumar believes otherwise. &ldquo;We entered agroforestry because we needed herbs for our spice and mouth freshener business, packaging because of company needs and hospitality because of my passion and our group&rsquo;s emphasis on Indian culture,&rdquo; he mentions. That being the case, the experiential DS Museum will probably have a lot more tales to tell about the group&rsquo;s journey in the coming years. <span class="s1">&beta;</span></p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>&mdash;with inputs from Kishore Singh</strong></p>', 'Unlisted major DS Group is eyeing new growth drivers in the FMCG space to dwarf its core tobacco and mouth freshener businesses', '9', '', 0, 'ccb49c40850803e12854c65c813e6b12.jpg', 'looking-beyond-tobacco-8', 5, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Looking Beyond Tobacco', 'Unlisted major DS Group is eyeing new growth drivers in the FMCG space to dwarf its core tobacco and mouth freshener businesses', '', '', '', 'DS Group,Catch Masalas,Rajnigandha,FMCG', 0, NULL, '2014-12-15 18:29:15', '2014-12-18 20:05:38', '2014-11-28', 0),

He asks his students to put all the contents into the jar. Every attempt made by the students ends unsuccessfully, with either pebbles or rocks being left behind. The professor then shows the students an alternate way. He first places all the rocks in the jar, then all the pebbles, and later empties the entire sand, which fits nicely in the crevices between the rocks and pebbles. Finally, without disturbing the setup, he manages to pour all the water into the jar. The underlying message in the tale is a reflection of our lives: where we often prioritise sand and water (insignificant things) and leave out the real big things (rocks or pebbles). It&rsquo;s a mistake that Rajiv Vij chose not to make. [[QUOTE]]<br /></em></p>\r\n<p><em>It was in 2006 that Vij quit his job as managing director (Asia, Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe) for Franklin Templeton Investments and embraced his true calling, what he refers to as making a &lsquo;life shift&rsquo;. The move gave Vij a shot at living the good life: reading a lot, writing, spending quality time with family and playing sports. To make a living, as against the 12-16 hours he spent each day at his previous job, Vij today spends six hours a day coaching corporate executives. He recently authored his maiden book,&nbsp;</em>Discovering Your Sweet Spot &mdash; A Soul Searching Guide for Creating the Life You Really Want<em>. In an interaction with Outlook Business, Vij throws light on what his new calling is all about.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>What kind of people do you coach?</strong></p>\r\n<p>When I started off, there was no criteria. Whoever wanted to be coached, be it individuals or corporates, I would take them on board. But now, it&rsquo;s 75% corporates, where the company engages me to coach their leaders, CXOs and senior management; 10% reach out on their own because they think they need guidance; while 15% comprise leaders from the social sector. That&rsquo;s the pro bono work that I do. As far as their age group is concerned, it&rsquo;s largely between 40 and 55. There&rsquo;s a reason behind this: all these achievers say that it&rsquo;s lonely at the top and they feel the need for an unbiased, neutral person to talk to. That is also the age when most of us go through a phase in life when we begin to contemplate on our limitations. At 20, you feel like you can conquer the world, at 30 you sort of feel good, but 40 is when you end up facing a whole lot of issues that you need to resolve. At this age, you start questioning yourself; you might be facing some stumbling blocks at work, you may have certain questions around the state of your relationship, your marriage may not be in as good shape as it used to be, you may have teenage kids who are difficult to handle, and so on. That&rsquo;s when deeper conversations with someone you can open up to are very revealing, refreshing and offer an opportunity for change.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is the nature of your mandate?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Firstly, my work is to put clients on a process of self-discovery. I am not a mentor or a guide offering them prescriptive solutions. I don&rsquo;t have a formula that will make people good leaders. What I do is to make individuals come up with their own five-point formula that will help them become more effective leaders. It&rsquo;s a journey of self-awareness. When you&rsquo;re in a leadership position, you cannot distinguish between personal effectiveness and professional effectiveness. Who you are begins to come through very quickly &mdash; whether you are courageous, temperamental, insecure, perfectionist, whatever. Which is why I work with individuals from a holistic point of view. So I work on anything from leadership to managing boards, to finding one&rsquo;s calling, emotional issues, temperament. I have a process to help people discover their own answers. It&rsquo;s a rich conversation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Could you give us examples and explain how you dealt with them?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s say that someone says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stressed out&rdquo;. One reason for being stressed may be because you are a perfectionist &mdash; that&rsquo;s what you have been rewarded for throughout your career. While it&rsquo;s fine to perfect certain things, you can&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t need to perfect everything. As I said, my conversations are meant to create self-awareness. So, typically, I&rsquo;ll ask, &ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s happening? When do you get stressed? What do you get stressed about? Is it to do with people, is it self-created, or is it your fear or failure? Is it coming from your need to prove yourself or to be perfect?&rdquo; Then I make the person aware of other options. So, I ask, &ldquo;Is this the only way or is there another way you can function?&rdquo; Very often, we all work as per our own belief systems. A part of the belief system may be true, while some of it you may simply rationalise and get stuck with. So you just accept it and try and deal with it. But then you need to think beyond that, think of a desired future. You need to imagine what a day when you are able to do everything and be effective, and yet not feel stressed out, will look like. I will urge the person to give shape to that day in the future. Knowing the contours of what&rsquo;s going on, and what you want it to be like, and then start working on a personal plan, and doing something about it. And then, I take people through that execution &mdash; explain how the system worked, what was the problem, and so on.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Give us one tip on how to be more effective and less stressed at work.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>One of the things that people find useful is figuring out, say, the three things that really matter to them. So, think about your most important life priorities in the coming 12 months. Typically, people spend only 25-30% of their time on these priorities. Then think about what you would ideally like it to be and what needs to change to make that happen, and work towards that. If you can make this shift, it will bring about a big change. You should look at life and work separately. To have a better life, you need to be able to spend lesser time at work. And to do better at work, you need to able to prioritise on important stuff. So, on the work side, if you get that right, you will free up time.</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can set priorities for a month, hopefully emanating from your annual priorities. It can be something like creating a digital game plan, for example. That&rsquo;s the big thing to achieve in a year. For you as a journalist, it&rsquo;s not that big a deal if you get one story more or less, but moving towards a digital plan could be a game-changer. The idea is not to rush anything but block time for everything that is important. When you think of your week, block time for things; each day, block time for the most important things. Nothing is then based on hope. Nothing is left to chance. Then you start to question other things on the list. Ask yourself, do we need to do this. If yes, then do I need to do this? Even if I need to do this, should I do this with the same frequency? Do I give it the same amount of time? Look at ways of reducing physical time. That will free up a lot of time.</p>\r\n<p><strong>But physical absence does not take away the stress, because you may be mentally occupied and stressed about situations all the time</strong></p>\r\n<p>Yes, there is also the emotional side; once you become very aware of it, you can work on it. My question usually is: do you know of anyone in your type of role who you think is far more at peace, less stressed? Sometimes you can&rsquo;t think of anyone, but sometimes you do. Think about what is it that they do that you can pick up. In India, you always need a plan B. Even if someone needs to be picked up from the airport, you need a plan B, because suddenly the person you are meeting will fall sick, or the car will break down, or something else will happen. Half the time, your mind is busy with all that. Now, can you let go of all that? Can you create a structure to analyse all those things? It&rsquo;s difficult to make those shifts because we are wired in a certain way.</p>\r\n<p>Meditation, again, is a very effective tool to handle the emotional aspect. If you can create 15 minutes to reflect and connect with your deeper self, it will be helpful. It works for me but I don&rsquo;t prescribe it to people. I just ask them what they think will work for them. It&rsquo;s a very holistic approach. At the end of it, people find themselves in a different place from where they started. It&rsquo;s like a refresher in some ways. We start looking at life in a different way.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can you tell us about some more transformative stories?</strong></p>\r\n<p>I worked with a leader in Thailand who was a great performer but was temperamental. His first question was, &ldquo;I am doing well and this is what has worked for me &mdash; push people, get things done. So, tell me, should I be Mr. Calm, or should I be effective?&rdquo; I asked him, does it have to be either-or? For him, for quite some time, it was either-or. But I pushed him to think of people who were calm and effective; come up with a list of people who are like that. Then, suddenly, a whole bunch of ideas started to come up. It starts with some behavioural shifts &mdash; he started saying I&rsquo;m not going to be upset even if my people push some shoddy stuff my way; it is a decision I am committing to, I am not going to get upset. He did that for a while but later came back and said, while I am not expressing my anger, I still am angry. Then we start working on the emotional aspects.</p>\r\n<p><span>We get upset when there is a mismatch between expectations and reality. Are my expectations too high? Should they be high for everybody, all the time? Can you set up boundaries and then let people play the way they want to within those boundaries? So, the first step is to moderate your expectations. No point fighting the reality all the time; you have to accept it and that&rsquo;s a skill. Whether pleasant or unpleasant; accept what life presents to you and let go.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I had another person from Pakistan, who said, &ldquo;I am never where I am. I am wired this way, I want to change, but I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; So we set a goal for him: always enjoying the moment, 24/7. The thing with these conversations is that every goal has an impact on so many other things. His engagement with work went up, he used to be restless but became more relaxed, his family life was better. Now when he is with the kids, he is with the kids.</p>\r\n<p>There was this outstanding guy at work but he could not get along with people. He was extremely goal-driven and wouldn&rsquo;t accept any compromises. One day, he told me, &ldquo;I have been thinking about this lately. I think I am not a good human being. I don&rsquo;t think I am bad person but interactions with me are never pleasant. With my boss, I freak out if he is not transparent, I get angry if my subordinates don&rsquo;t present things the way I want, and it&rsquo;s the same story at home as well.&rdquo; I asked him, &ldquo;How much would you rate yourself as human being? He answered, &ldquo;2/10&rdquo;. &ldquo;Where do you want to be?&rdquo; His answer was, &ldquo;7/10&rdquo;. That was a big deal for him. As we worked through this, he felt liberated. Around the eighth session or so, he said, &ldquo;I just hope I am not losing my edge. I am becoming Mr. Soft.&rdquo; But he found his balance. The thing is, one size does not fit all. The two problems are exactly the same and yet different people dealt with them in different ways.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>', 'The author of Discovering Your Sweet Spot — A Soul Searching Guide for Creating the Life You Really Want shares his wisdom\r\nOUTLOOK BUSINESS INTERVIEWS RAJIV VIJ', '5', '', 0, '', 'media-watch-research-free-speech-resources-support-the-hoot-latest-stories-soari', 1, 1, 1, 0, 19, '"Think Of A Desired Future And Learn To Prioritise Llife Around It"', 'The author of Discovering Your Sweet Spot — A Soul Searching Guide for Creating the Life You Really Want shares his wisdom', '', '', '', 'Rajiv Vij,Discovering your sweet spot,self-awareness,leadership,stress', 0, NULL, '2014-12-15 18:36:52', '2015-06-08 14:29:05', '2014-11-28', 43),

(11, 31, '', 'Why Value Investors Fancy J&K Bank', '<p>Mushtaq Ahmad had never seen such devastation in his entire life. The recent flash floods in Jammu &amp; Kashmir that swept through 20 of the 22 districts in the state have wiped out over 5,700 villages and uprooted over 15 lakh families, besides destroying hundreds of livelihoods and business establishments. Ahmad has not lost anything personal, but as the chairman and CEO of the state&rsquo;s biggest lender, J&amp;K Bank, the pain is official. The reason: the 75-year-old bank, in which the state government holds a 53% stake, has 45% of its commercial advances tied to establishments in the state. Besides, two of its big corporate clients &mdash; REI Agro and HDIL &mdash; have turned out to be NPAs, a big reason why the stock fell out of favour with the Street since the development was leaked by a local newspaper last May. The market&rsquo;s fears have not been unfounded, as the gross NPA has increased from 1.7% as of FY14 to 4.2% as of June 2015. Thanks to all this stress, profits declined 58% to Rs 130 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal. In a triple whammy, rating agency Crisil downgraded the bank&rsquo;s fixed deposits from &lsquo;AA+/stable&rsquo; to &lsquo;AA/negative&rsquo; in the wake of the stress in the asset quality and its fallout on the bank&rsquo;s profitability.</p>\n<p>Since the adverse turn of events that began early last year, the stock has fallen 34% to Rs 137 as on November 10. But these adverse developments have led deal-hungry investors to pile on to the stock, which is now trading at 1X its book value and 6X its current year estimated earnings. In fact, if one invests at the current market price, the dividend yield alone works out to 3.5%. Not surprising, then, that contrarian value investors fancy the stock. Apart from several renowned mutual funds, Parag Parikh&rsquo;s Long-Term Value Fund among them, well-known US-based value investor Mohnish Pabrai holds a 2.56% stake, valued at Rs 174 crore, through Pabrai Investment Fund. Pabrai&rsquo;s stake was noticed for the first time in the September 2014 quarter, during which the stock traded in the range of Rs 141 to Rs 147 per share. If market sources are to be believed, even reticent investors such as Fortuna Capital partner Sanjoy Bhattacharyya have bought the stock.</p>\n<p><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418914493.jpg" alt="Efficiency stakes" width="808" height="551" /></p>\n<p>According to Bhattacharyya, the odds are in favour of investors given the attractive valuation. He believes that despite the uncertainty, the bank has managed to expand its dominant market share and improve interest margins. That apart, he admires its low-cost operating model, which has a 20% growth in business volumes without compromising capital adequacy or taking on excess leverage.</p>\n<p>Operating in Jammu &amp; Kashmir since 1939, J&amp;K Bank has grown its revenue and profits at an annual rate of 16% and 26%, respectively, over the last decade. Along with its long operating history and capable management, operationally, too, the bank is attractive. It has strong operating margins (a net interest margin of 3.8%), return on equity of 22%, huge operating cash flows and minimal capex. Despite the stress in the balance sheet, it has strong NPA coverage ratio (87% in FY14) and a well-capitalised balance sheet (capital adequacy ratio of 12.7% in FY14), with a net worth of close to Rs 6,000 crore.</p>\n<p><strong>Stress Test</strong></p>\n<p>Despite the presence of reputed investors, the Street&rsquo;s concerns revolve around the bank&rsquo;s list of NPAs thanks to big defaulters such as REI Agro, Bhushan Steel and HDIL. The bank has already declared slippages of close to Rs 1,100 crore in Q1FY15 in two accounts &mdash; REI Agro and HDIL. Though this gives cause for worry, the bank is well-placed in terms of risk to its books as these three accounts &mdash; with a total exposure of about Rs 1,500-1,600 crore &mdash; only account for about 3.5% of its total loan book of Rs 46,000 crore and about 25-27% of its net worth. That apart, these risks have already been identified and provided for in the past quarter, so apart from any slippages from Bhushan Steel &mdash; so far considered a standard asset (normal because of payments) by the bank &mdash; the incremental pain should be very less. In fact, the bank has got more than its share of leeway in subsequent months: the HDIL account has since turned standard (earlier considered to be an NPA because of operational issues) and the Rs 45 crore-65 crore provision made by the bank in the previous quarter is set to be written back. Similarly, the REI Agro account, which was earlier considered to be an NPA, has been restructured in recent months, bringing some relief for the bank in terms of provisioning.</p>\n<p><span>Apart from these three clients, a larger worry for the bank seems to stem from the possible impact of the recent floods in Jammu &amp; Kashmir on its loan book, especially in the agriculture, SME and trade segments. Though this could certainly have huge implications for the bank, numbers suggest a silver lining here as well. For instance, as of Q1FY15, the bank&rsquo;s loan book stood at Rs 46,000 crore, out of which only 45% &mdash; or about Rs 20,700 crore &mdash; is in Jammu &amp; Kashmir. However, as only 75% of the area under the state has been affected by the floods, theoretically, only 75% of J&amp;K Bank&rsquo;s Rs 15,500-crore book could stand to be at risk. If one further assesses the damages based only on the most impacted segments such as agriculture, trade and SME, which together account for 47% of its loan book, risky loans could be in the region of about Rs 7,000-8,000 crore, which is about 15-17% of its total loans and about 1-1.3X its net worth. This number is still big enough to wipe out the bank&rsquo;s net worth but only if all of its borrowers fail to pay up. Still, no one expects all of the bank&rsquo;s loans to turn into NPAs, as any default will also impact the creditworthiness and borrowing ability of the borrowers in the future. Analysts expect any sort of stress due to slippages, willful defaulters and the inability of certain borrowers to pay to also be felt gradually, giving the bank enough time and an opportunity to deal with the same. &ldquo;Though we believe that there will be some regulatory easing when it comes to these loans, providing J&amp;K Bank incentives in terms of priority sector requirements, target requirements and NPA recognition, its balance sheet will no doubt be impacted for the next two quarters,&rdquo; says Pritesh Bumb of Prabhudas Lilladher.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418914634.jpg" alt="Mushtaq" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>"To judge a bank''s performance, focus on the medium- to long-term results and don''t be disappointed with the results of just one quarter" </strong></p>\n<p><strong>- Mushtaq Ahmad, CEO and chairman, J&amp;K Bank</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is also the reason why the market does not expect a major increase in NPAs right away. &ldquo;Though it is hard to predict the actual impact, our internal calculations suggest that because of these issues and the recent floods, we could see J&amp;K&rsquo;s NPAs going up by another 2-3%,&rdquo; says Vallabh Kulkarni, who tracks the bank at Motilal Oswal Securities. With historical NPAs at about 2%, J&amp;K Bank is considered as one of the most efficient banks around. In the current environment, however, it might have to bear additional NPAs, which could result in its NPA ratio going up to 4-5% of its loan book. Even in such extreme circumstances, the possibility of the bank making losses and reporting an erosion of its net worth is remote. In FY14, the bank made profits before NPA provisions of Rs 1,900 crore, 15X higher than its provisioning for NPAs, indicating that the bank has more than enough cushioning. Even if the Street&rsquo;s predictions of NPA provisioning going up to Rs 400 crore-450 crore in FY15 &mdash; as against Rs 127 crore in FY14 &mdash; come true, analysts remain optimistic as they estimate a profit of close to Rs 1,100 crore for the bank in FY15.</p>\n<p><strong>Silver Lining</strong></p>\n<p>Though the bank has the ability and financial strength to deal with the recent spate of negative developments, the impact of these events can only be managed, controlled and minimised. Some part of the stress will certainly show up on the bank&rsquo;s books and spill over to the next three-four quarters. &ldquo;We met J&amp;K Bank chairman and CEO Mushtaq Ahmad recently to understand the bank&rsquo;s outlook on business growth, profitability and asset quality. We think that growth could be moderate in the wake of recent floods in Jammu &amp; Kashmir and other asset quality issues. While slippages in the agri and horticulture books might rise in the near term, damage to the commercial book is likely to be limited. We expect return ratios to be under pressure in the near term but at 1X FY16 estimated book value, valuations largely factor in the negatives,&rdquo; says Kulkarni of Motilal Oswal Securities.</p>\n<p><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418914809.jpg" alt="What''s on the books" width="808" height="551" /></p>\n<p>So, what could really go wrong at the bank and how far can these events impact its financials? First of all, because of higher NPAs, provisioning for the same will go up and profits will be affected. That apart, the Street is expecting the bank&rsquo;s cost of funds to jump and margins to shrink because of the pressure on yields as a result of restructuring and slippages in some of its accounts. This combined knockout punch of lower margins and higher provisioning could together impact the bank&rsquo;s profits. Though the bank might show a marginal 5-7% decline in profits in FY15 as compared with the Rs 1,182 crore it made in FY14, lower profits will mean the bank will generate lower return on equity, which is estimated to fall from 22.3% in FY14 to 17-18% by the end of FY15. However, even under these conditions, book value will keep growing &mdash; albeit at a slow pace &mdash; to the extent of retained earnings, which will help in protecting its stock price.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the bank is currently exploring the idea of selling its 5% stake in MetLife Insurance; it had last jettisoned 5 crore shares in the company, amounting to a 6.26% stake, at Rs 36.5 per share for a neat Rs 182.5 crore. &ldquo;We have already decided that we will exit MetLife, in which we hold a 5% stake; most of the formalities have been completed in this regard. I think that should fetch us a very good return and I&rsquo;m sure we will end the year with an unusual growth in profits and the overall business. When you judge the performance of a bank, you need to focus on medium to long-term results instead of getting disappointed with the results of just one quarter,&rdquo; Ahmad said while addressing an analyst call in August this year. This time around, the bank is expecting a better valuation for its stake in MetLife all thanks to an improvement in the profitability of the venture and positive policy developments such as the hike in the FDI limit in insurance.</p>\n<p><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418914779.jpg" alt="Idle away" width="808" height="551" /></p>\n<p>Though word on the street is that the bank may net Rs 700 crore for its stake, even if the realised amount is less than that, that gives the bank significant leeway in terms of good coverage for future slippages in its loan accounts. That apart, when the recovery takes place, people and businesses will both need money, this time to recoup their losses, which can be nothing but good news for banks like J&amp;K that will gain business and an improvement in profitability. The bank, too, is confident of returning to its past glory once some of the issues highlighted in the past are resolved. &ldquo;I am sure once these two accounts (REI and HDIL) are addressed and issues rectified, our NPA levels will again be around 2%. We have witnessed a credit growth of 24-25% in Jammu &amp; Kashmir and I am very confident that we will maintain this figure in the state and keep credit growth going at 15% even outside the state, funding top-rate government of India undertakings and fundamentally sound business houses,&rdquo; added Ahmad.</p>\n<p>For now, the bank continues to maintain its focus on its high-growth home state, keeping a tab on the kind and quality of clients it currently services. Though its long-term prospects have not been hurt yet, near-term headwinds have had sufficient implications on the bank&rsquo;s finances. Though the markets have already factored in a large element of this risk, incremental news flows could have some bearing on share prices as the bank announces its results. Consequently, J&amp;K Bank could see its quality of earnings deteriorating for some time along with its falling return ratios.</p>\n<p>Yet, when compared with regional players such as South Indian Bank (trading at 9X its earnings) and PSUs such as State Bank of India (trading at 14X its earnings), J&amp;K Bank is relatively cheaper, being available for investors at 5X its earnings. In terms of price-to-book value as well, J&amp;K Bank is trading at a 30% discount compared with South Indian Bank and SBI. Perhaps now is a good time for investors to see merit in the logic of value investors and back the stock of the beleaguered bank.</p>', 'Despite short-term setbacks thanks to big-ticket defaulters and crippling floods in its home state, the long-term outlook doesn’t seem too dire for J&K Bank', '8', '', 0, '', 'why-value-investors-fancy-jk-bank-11', 1, 1, 1, 0, 16, 'Why Value Investors Fancy J&K Bank', 'Despite short-term setbacks thanks to big-ticket defaulters and crippling floods in its home state, the long-term outlook doesn’t seem too dire for J&K Bank', '', '', '', 'J&K Bank,NPAs,Bhushan Steel,Mushtaq Ahmad', 0, NULL, '2014-12-15 19:00:39', '2014-12-18 20:30:20', '2014-11-28', 0),

Posters of popular Hindi serials papered across the spacious and colourful workplace stand testament to the success achieved by this media house. As the man at the helm of this firm walks out of a meeting, his office informs him of more meetings, appointments and of the several people waiting to see him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;Evidently, Reliance Broadcast Network CEO Tarun Katial is a very busy man. How then, does he handle his never-ending workload? &ldquo;I practice a meditation technique called vipassana to keep work stress at bay,&rdquo; says Katial. A foldable cushioned jute mat on the windowsill in his cabin serves as evidence.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;I was initiated into the practice in 2003 by my aunt, Yashodhara Oberoi. My first 10-day residential course at the Vipassana Research Institute in Igatpuri was a life-changing experience that brought a sense of stability in my outlook towards life,&rdquo; says 39-year-old Katial, who practices vipassana daily for at least an hour.</p>\n<p class="p3">Katial then went on to attend around 12 additional sessions at the Igatpuri centre and at another in Gorai, a west Mumbai Suburb. A regular at most of the weekend sessions at these centres, Katial believes that the practice has helped him stay grounded and deal with what he calls self-created pressure.</p>\n<p class="p3">Vipassana is taught at these centres via audio-visual instructions and requires the learners to not communicate with each other at all. While this could seem challenging for some, the entertainment sector executive managed just fine. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good practice because everyone is going through their own mental catharsis. The course is like a mental dry-cleaning process. I didn&rsquo;t find the &lsquo;not communicating&rsquo; part much difficult because I don&rsquo;t speak that much even otherwise.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Katial has visited several vipassana centres abroad as well. When asked about his most memorable meditation experience, he reminisces about his visit to the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon in April last year. &ldquo;That was Guruji&rsquo;s (meditation guru SN Goenka, who introduced the meditation technique to India) last visit to this Pagoda before he passed away. We travelled to the monastery in Burma where he had attained enlightenment and meditated there. It was an enriching experience.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">For Katial, vipassana has played an important role in dealing with stress and anxiety at work at a time when work-life balance remains an elusive concept. &ldquo;I have managed to inspire several people in my family and my team to start practicing vipassana,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;People often have a misconception that to begin this course, you need mental stability or you do this only because you have some issues. This is not a medicine for our problems. It is a way of life,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">When he&rsquo;s not meditating, Katial is busy catching up with his favourite TV series. &ldquo;Currently, I am hooked on to the political drama series <em>Scandal</em> and I also try to stay updated with <em>Suits</em> and <em>How To Get Away With Murder</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Though Katial aims to attempt longer and more rigorous courses of vipassana in future, only time will tell if this leads him on the path to enlightenment.</p>', 'Reliance Broadcast Network CEO Tarun Katial explains why an ancient meditation technique offers him convenient catharsis', '13', '', 0, '', 'breathing-in-sorting-out-16', 11, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Breathing in, sorting out', 'Reliance Broadcast Network CEO Tarun Katial explains why an ancient meditation technique offers him convenient catharsis', '', '', '', '', 0, NULL, '2014-12-18 20:39:37', NULL, '2014-12-18', 0),

The narration is simple, lucid and the effort taken to produce a case study with each topic is commendable. The book covers an array of topics from politics, crony capitalism and corruption to natural resources, banking systems, financial architecture and real estate, which are all impressive. Author Rahul Saraogi has done a good job of connecting the many dots of Indian capital markets in brief. In my view, the primary audience of this book would be beginner foreign institutional investors, who seek to enter the Indian markets and wish to gain an insight into the economic history of India. Towards the end, the author outlines his philosophy about value investing and experiences surrounding those strategies. The case studies on the Vedanta Group, EID Parry and the Godrej group are interesting but I disagree with his thesis of Himatsingka Seide, which I found to be a problem of huge forex losses, a distorted balance sheet and unbridled expansion into a low-margin business.</p>\n<p class="p3">The book lacks lustre on three critical counts. One, it is a disappointment for investors and audiences seeking a critical analysis of value investing strategies and thoughts on methods for identification of specific investment opportunities in India. For example, a reader looking for suggested stock screening tools specific to the context of investing in India could eventually be overwhelmed by other offerings. Also, the author&rsquo;s brief observations on specific investment case studies may not stand the test of time. Second, the narration of the book is like a rear-view mirror drive: it delves deep into the past and offers very little on what the future holds for investors investing in India. With a progressive and business-friendly government firmly saddled at the centre, the economic environment will be much more predictable and the future is going to be much better than what investors have experienced over the last two decades. A peek into the future would have had improved the appeal for investors. Lastly, as I mentioned earlier, the book has been written keeping in mind a firm target audience and ideally, should be called &lsquo;a beginners guide to Indian capital market for foreign institutional investors&rsquo;. A close observer of stocks will find themselves living through these episodes in the last two decades.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Investors looking for pure value investing strategies that would work in most circumstances should refer to investing classics such as <em>Security Analysis</em> by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, <em>Margin of Safety</em> by Seth Klarman and <em>You Can Be a Stock Market Genius</em> by Joel Greenblatt. This book&rsquo;s distinction lies in compiling the timeline of the Indian investing landscape over the last three decades and partially examining investing strategies in such a setting.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Insights</strong></span></p>\n<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><strong>Disposable Confidence</strong></strong></span></p>\n<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418915686.jpg" alt="Insight 1" width="850" height="580" /></strong></span></p>\n<p class="p1">In a study based on a sample of large S&amp;P 1500 companies, researchers <strong>Joon Mahn Lee</strong>, <strong>Byoung-Hyoun Hwang</strong> and <strong>Hailiang Chen</strong> found that founder CEOs are more overconfident than professional CEOs hired later by the company. They studied the tweets, statements and predictions of the CEOs and found that founder CEOs use substantially less negative words, are highly optimistic about earnings and are more likely to hold on to unreasonably high number of options. The study also suggests that investors are unaware of this overconfidence, which contributes to over-valuation of firms. While founder CEOs&rsquo; overconfidence is dispositional, professional CEOs&rsquo; overconfidence comes from organisational context and past experiences. Either way, how beneficial can this confidence be?

Of course, a bottle or two were hastily produced for the monarch.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2014-12-18/1418916166.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;Nearly two centuries later, this tale still makes for a great fireside story. Back then, distilleries tucked their stills away in forested highland glens to make it difficult for excise inspectors to locate them. So, it was a bold move on part of George Smith, when, in 1824, he sought a licence to produce Glenlivet legally, close to where its illegal stills once functioned. As it did back then, the spring water that goes into the whisky comes from its original source &mdash; Josie&rsquo;s Well, although who Josie was has been lost in the mists of time. As for Smith, instead of being complimented for his troubles, he invited the wrath of his peers and whisky smugglers, necessitating the use of his flintlock on several occasions. Thanks to him, Glenlivet continues to flow freely and legally in my &mdash; and a million other &mdash; bars around the world. It&rsquo;s the largest single malt brand in the US &mdash; and the second-largest worldwide &mdash; due to the lifting of prohibition in 1933, which coincided with the visit of Glenlivet&rsquo;s Capt Bill Smith Grant. In those days, miniature bottles of Glenlivet would be served on Pullman trains plying the great Midwest.

(21, 12, '', 'Rolling out success', '<p class="p1">Making the perfect <em>dosa</em> is an art. You have to pour the batter onto the frying pan at the correct moment, spread it in perfect circles and roast it for the right amount of time &mdash; long enough to make it golden and crispy but not enough to burn it. Not everyone can master it,&rdquo; says Eshwar K Vikas, an obvious fan of this south Indian delicacy. The culinary art of <em>dosa</em>-making has traveled &mdash; and traveled well &mdash; across India, making it one of the most popular south Indian dishes in the country. However, while a <em>dosa</em> can cost you just Rs 15 in the south, prices escalate as you travel north, skyrocketing as you travel abroad. So when two electrical engineers from SRM University, Chennai, noticed this disparity, they came up with a solution to give people their daily <em>dosa</em> fix. &ldquo;When the process of making western food like burgers and wraps can be standardised, why not Indian dishes? After all, even if people like pizzas and burgers, most Indians crave for <em>dosas</em>, <em>chutney</em> and <em>sambar</em>, especially when they are travelling. So we decided to devise a way to bring <em>dosa</em>-making costs down while standardising the process,&rdquo; says 23-year-old Eshwar, who, along with classmate Sudeep Sabat, set out to make India&rsquo;s first fully-automatic table-top <em>dosa</em>-making machine &mdash; Dosamatic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The duo first pursued their insight of standardising Indian dishes in their second year of college. &ldquo;Unlike a burger, which costs the same across the country, the price of a <em>dosa</em> varies greatly. This, we realised, was because preparing Indian food requires a certain amount of skill, which pushes the price of the dish up. We felt that automation was the way to go in order to standardise this skill,&rdquo; says Vikas. With the help of their mechanical engineering friends and Google Sketch Up, the duo worked on a design for the prototype, building the machine with manpower, equipment and working space assistance from Chennai-based storage equipment manufacturer Amarsons, where they had interned in the past. The nine-month project was funded by their savings, internship gains and a Rs 120,000 grant from their college, and by end-2011, they were ready with a prototype &mdash; a machine the size of a four-seater dining table. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The production process didn&rsquo;t stop there. Realising that a truly scalable design would need to be compact to stand out among existing industrial-size models, Vikas and Sabat set up Mukunda Foods in 2012 and continued their search for a better prototype, raking in Rs 2.5 lakh in funds through college competitions in the meantime. They came up with their fourth and final prototype in November 2013 &mdash; a table-top <em>dosa</em>-making machine the size of a microwave oven. &ldquo;When compared with the previous prototypes, this one was more robust, commercially viable and scalable,&rdquo; says Vikas.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Sealing the deal</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">So, how does Dosamatic work? The 50-kg machine sports containers for batter, water and oil. At the press of a button, it pipes and spreads the batter into the shape of a <em>dosa</em>, sprinkles oil on it and roasts it. The thickness of the <em>dosa</em> is between 1 mm and 6 mm and can be set manually. Dosamatic, which retails for Rs 1 lakh, takes just 60 seconds to complete the whole process and produce one piping hot <em>dosa</em>. Vikas says, &ldquo;In terms of electricity, it costs only 50 paise to make one <em>dosa</em> while LPG consumes 6 grams and costs Rs 1.25 to make a <em>dosa</em>.</p>\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;Some of its features were inspired by mundane, everyday tasks. &ldquo;The action of spreading the <em>dosa</em> and pleating it required a swing mechanism and the inspiration for it came from a bike&rsquo;s side-stand. Similarly, we came up with several other design solutions from daily life,&rdquo; says Sudeep.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="Dosamatic 1" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-07/1420620245.jpg" alt="graphic" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">By the time the fourth prototype was finalised, Mukunda Foods had already advertised Dosamatic through its website and social media. The company received its first order in January 2014 through Facebook &mdash; Rishikesh-based Radhe Sahni was facing trouble with skilled manpower at his <em>dosa</em> cafe. &ldquo;I realised that Dosamatic was a good alternative to manual labour. The machine comes very handy and the <em>dosa</em> tastes just like the ones you or I would make. While the taste of a man-made <em>dosa</em> can vary each time, Dosamatic ensures that the output and its quality is standard,&rdquo; says Sahni. Mukunda Foods went on to amass around 50 clients, including big names such as the Adani group, the Swaminarayan temple in Gujarat and Nimhans hospital in New Delhi. The popularity of this south Indian delicacy has also fetched it international clients &mdash; mostly, NRIs who own or run Indian restaurants. Currently, 30% of Mukunda Foods&rsquo; revenue comes from overseas.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Fighting fit</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">There is no dearth of automatic or semi-automatic food-making machines in the Indian food machines industry, with a number of manufacturers such as Jas Enterprise, Akshar Enterprise and Esskay Enterprise in the fray. What differentiates Mukunda Foods, according to Sudeep, is the fact that &mdash; compared with other machines &mdash; Dosamatic is not just compact and smaller in size but also caters to a very different audience. &ldquo;Most industrial machines are used in institutional kitchens, such as hostel messes, where huge quantities of food are required. Dosamatic is targeted towards restaurants and office cafeterias that require lesser quantities of food but in a fixed period of time. Dosamatic is a great tool for restaurants, especially if they are looking to establish themselves as quick service restaurant (QSR) chains,&rdquo; he says, whose focus is on creating a QSR solution for anyone who runs or wants to start a south Indian restaurant.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="Dosamatic 2" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-07/1420620327.jpg" alt="graphic" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">Currently, Mukunda Foods conducts product demos for potential customers at its Bengaluru office and offers free doorstep installation and complimentary <em>dosa</em> and <em>chutney</em> batter worth Rs 4,000-Rs 5,000 along with the machine. As of August 2014, the company has sold 28 machines and expects to close CY14 with Rs 1.3 crore in revenue. Mukunda Foods also has an order pipeline of 100 machines ending December 2014, of which 30 will travel abroad. The company is also in talks with e-commerce website Snapdeal to retail the machine online very soon.</p>\n<p class="p3">The 30-member team at Mukunda is now working on setting up <em>dosa</em> experience stores, where people can walk in, operate the machine, experiment with it and consume the <em>dosas</em> right away. One such store has opened in Delhi, to be followed by Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Vikas is confident that Dosamatic has the potential to scale up. &ldquo;Nearly 12 lakh wet grinders to make <em>dosa</em> batter are sold in our country every year, which means that there are at least 12 lakh consumers who want to make <em>dosas</em>. This makes us confident that our machine will work.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="dosa 3" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-07/1420620368.jpg" alt="talking head " width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Dosamatic''s vision should be to get it into homes and touch a price point at which anyone can buy the machine" - Balasubramaniam Hari, Angel investor</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Investors, too, nod in agreement.

Dosamatic is a perfect fit for the &lsquo;Make in India&rsquo; promise.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Paving the way</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Mukunda Foods is doing its best to tackle potential challenges and threats. According to Vikas, competition isn&rsquo;t that big an issue as the barrier to entry is very high in this space as most of the machine parts are indigenously made. Also, Dosamatic sells only in places where service centres for all parts are available. &ldquo;Our current focus is on after-sales support. Luckily, there have been no reported technical breakdowns so far, only a few errors that we fixed immediately,&rdquo; smiles Vikas. In order to grow its business, Mukunda Foods is counting on a national expansion before branching out abroad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="dosA 4" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-07/1420620479.jpg" alt="image" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">The company is also doing its best to improve the quality of the machine, thereby bringing down its cost. &ldquo;We have to make it cost-efficient for restaurants or corporates to use Dosamatic,&rdquo; says Vikas. Mukunda Foods is also looking at automating the process to make <em>samosas</em> and <em>vadas</em> next. The next logical step for Mukunda Foods would be to enter the consumer market and make Dosamatic a household name. &ldquo;We have not looked into the consumer market yet. We will venture into that segment only once we have a good grip on the market,&rdquo; he says. Hari agrees. &ldquo;Their vision should be to get Dosamatic into homes and sell a larger number of units. They have to touch a price point at which anyone can buy the machine.&rdquo; For now, the idea of entering your office canteen and making yourself a <em>dosa</em> &mdash; just like you make yourself a cup of cappuccino from the coffee machine <em>&mdash;</em> with the press of a few buttons keeps Vikas going.&nbsp;</p>', 'With its automatic table-top dosa-making machine Dosamatic, Mukunda Foods is looking to introduce variety in the predictable Indian QSR market', '15', '', 0, '', 'rolling-out-success-21', 16, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Rolling out success', 'With its automatic table-top dosa-making machine Dosamatic, Mukunda Foods is looking to introduce variety in the predictable Indian QSR market', '', '', '', 'Dosamatic,Mukunda Foods,Dosa,food-making machines,table-top dosa machine,QSR', 0, NULL, '2014-12-19 15:57:01', '2015-01-07 14:18:19', '2014-11-14', 0),
(22, 12, '', 'Food for app', '<p class="p1">Ordering food over the telephone is a Herculean task, resulting in shouting matches, mistaken identities and mixed up addresses. But the entry of food listing websites and apps has made life easier by giving us access to restaurants that we otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have known. Food delivery apps have taken that one step forward &mdash; you can now place your orders on the app or on its website and have food on your plate in an hour. In the past, restaurant chains such as Domino&rsquo;s, Faaso&rsquo;s and Ammi&rsquo;s Biryani allowed customers to place orders online.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Food delivery apps, then, are not a novel phenomenon &mdash; this is an idea that has been around for a while. Former IT professional Ritesh Dwivedy was one of the first with HungryZone (initially, HungryBangalore), in 2006 with 15 Bengaluru restaurants listed on the website. With an initial investment of Rs 1 lakh and the founding team&rsquo;s IT experience, designing the website was a breeze. That was the easy part &mdash; the problem was convincing restaurants to be a part of the site, especially at a time when e-commerce was fairly new to India and restricted to booking travel tickets online.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="app 1" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-07/1420620718.jpg" alt="graphic" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">But by May 2007, HungryZone, which works on a commission basis, had listed 100 restaurants and signed up 1,500 users on its website. Says Dwivedy, &ldquo;We follow a success rate model. While the service is free for the users of the app and website, we charge a 10% commission on successful orders.&rdquo; Despite being in the business for nine years, HungryZone still considers itself in the growth stage. &ldquo;We are constantly trying to expand to more cities, add restaurants and work on our technology to make it more scalable,&rdquo; adds Dwivedy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Hungry for growth&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">In 2011, London-based Just Eat Holdings took over HungryZone and rebranded it as Just Eat India. As of 2013, Just Eat had gone through three rounds of investment, the first of which landed it Rs 50 lakh-60 lakh. The second round came in 2011 and the third in November 2013, when Just Eat Holdings, along with Axon Partners and Forum Synergies PE Fund Managers invested an undisclosed amount. Hemchandra Javeri, co-founder and MD, Forum Synergies says, &ldquo;A strong local know-how is required to run such companies. It helps that Just Eat&rsquo;s 100-strong team in India has built a strong ecosystem of restaurants over the years.&rdquo; As on date, Just Eat has listings of over 2,700 restaurants across Mumbai, Chennai, Pune, Bengaluru and Delhi-NCR. With over 600,000 registered users and an average ticket size of Rs 200-500, the company&rsquo;s orders have grown by 200% last year and it hopes to notch up sales of Rs 70 crore in FY15.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Founded in October 2007, a year after Just Eat, TastyKhana began as a joint venture between friends Sheldon D&rsquo;souza and Shachin Bharadwaj. This Pune-based company started with the founders&rsquo; savings and only five to ten clients. TastyKhana now has 9,000+ restaurants covered across India, with over a million orders processed so far. Its internal review system ensures that restaurants that are rated poorly are ticked off the list. This is because the site aims to continue its growth in terms of restaurant cover across the country; after all, it was this extensive cover and a 400% increase in the number of orders in 2012 that tempted its Berlin-based investor Delivery Hero to invest $5 million in the company. Says Niklas &Ouml;stberg, CEO, Delivery Hero, &ldquo;Our strength in our core market allows us to invest in smaller companies and supply them the technological know-how and financial resources required to take them to the top of the market.&rdquo; Like Just Eat, TastyKhana, too, is the Indian face for its parent, the only difference being that it hasn&rsquo;t been rebranded after the investment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="app 3" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-07/1420621021.jpg" alt="graphic" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">The portal&rsquo;s home ground, Pune, is its strongest base. Users from the city say they rarely face problems with its delivery while placing orders via the portal&rsquo;s app. Outside Pune, in metros such as Delhi and Mumbai, users are quite disappointed with the performance of the app, with many disgruntled users claiming their orders were either not placed or never arrived. Srinivas, owner of Shanmukha restaurant in Bengaluru, says, &ldquo;We have been listed on both TastyKhana as well as Just Eat and there has been a 40-45% increase in sales per day. But we find TastyKhana less cooperative as compared with Just Eat, since the company often forgets to place orders with us.&rdquo; Explains Bharadwaj, &ldquo;Operational efficiency is crucial in our line of business. The maximum traffic comes in during the four hours around mealtime (lunch and dinner), which is why we need to invest a more in seamless order transmission systems and good customer support channels to manage the spike in traffic.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="app 2" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-07/1420620908.jpg" alt="talking head" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We need to invest more in seamless order transmission systems and good customer support channels" - Sachin Bharadwaj, founder, TastyKhana</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">But it&rsquo;s not as if these are the only options available at hand to both restaurants and customers. While DeliveryChef&rsquo;s humble listing of 700+ restaurants and 3,500 hits daily from across Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru and Pune may not seem much to a customer looking for variety, the company promises to deliver quality over quantity. DeliveryChef founder Aditi Kapur started the company in 2010 with Rs 25 lakh from her personal savings after returning home from New York. Her time in Manhattan as a student ensured that she fully understood the value of take-out and delivery. &ldquo;The difference in accents made it very difficult for me to place orders and restaurants often got my name or order wrong. This is why I decided to switch to ordering food online,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">DeliveryChef takes a 10-15% cut from each order placed. Adds Kapur, &ldquo;This involves zero risk for restaurateurs as the commission is charged only on confirmed sales.&rdquo; Though the company&rsquo;s app is new to Google&rsquo;s Play Store and Apple&rsquo;s App Store, Kapur is confident that it will do well, with a 25% jump in Delivery Chef&rsquo;s revenue expected in the first three months of release. Technological upkeep accounts for a major chunk of expenses. The company expects food sales worth Rs 5 crore - 10 crore by the end of the current financial year&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="app 5" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-07/1420621229.jpg" alt="graphic" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">Kapur insists that the best way to keep a check on quality is by filtering the restaurants that are registered on the site. &ldquo;We are selective about the restaurants we list as we don&rsquo;t want to damage our brand equity. We sustain ourselves by maintaining quality and not quantity,&rdquo; she explains. Breaking even operationally in March this year and a Rs 1-crore investment from a Silicon Valley angel investor has helped Kapur keep her business afloat. The company now plans to expand within its current cities of operation and even in Chennai and Hyderabad. For now, it is most active in Delhi and Mumbai, with the average order size being Rs 500. In Pune and Bengaluru, DeliveryChef sees average orders of Rs 400.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="app 4" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-07/1420621100.jpg" alt="talking head" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We are selective about the restaurants we list on our app as we don''t want to damage our brand equity" - Aditi Kapur, founder, Delivery Chef</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s not just independent players that are part of the action. Search website Justdial also offers customers the option of placing their orders on its website and app. The company plans to integrate this feature with its payment gateway service JDCash, which is currently a work in progress. At the moment, 60% of the restaurants in 16 cities listed on the website have opted for the service. VSS Mani, CEO and MD, JustDial claims that this was a model he had seen during his travels abroad and that he was keen on developing something similar back home. &ldquo;I realised that we would need a food delivery system for Justdial as well. We were waiting for the right ecosystem and for our database to develop as well,&rdquo;says Mani. Still in pilot mode, the service is offered as an app for restaurants listed on Justdial, using cloud-hosted solutions to help them handle calls better. The service is currently offered at no charge to the customer but the company plans to monetise this by charging 10-15% on the order value. Mani remains confident that, once monetised, the service could triple Justdial&rsquo;s revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Fighting the phone</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Though convenience is an advantage, the biggest challenge for most of these companies is laughably basic &mdash; the telephone. Customers would undeniably prefer picking up the phone and making calls to their regular haunts when they&rsquo;re hungry than have to browse through an app. Both Kapur and Dwivedy claim that the challenge lies in changing the habits of the urban Indian foodie from making phone calls to shifting to an app or a website. Adds Kapur, &ldquo;At a time when 80% of the orders placed for home delivery are via the telephone, making that shift might take longer than expected.&rdquo; With players such as Zomato not planning to move towards online delivery anytime soon, the dial-a-meal concept will probably take some time to go out of style.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Most of these companies in the food delivery app space depend heavily on digital marketing and social media to establish their presence. Kapur hopes that the app and her efforts at marketing DeliveryChef through customised e-mail marketing will help convince prospective users about DeliveryChef. Says Bharadwaj, &ldquo;To get users to move online, the first incentive is an offer or a discount that is only available online. It&rsquo;s almost like getting free samples in an ice-cream parlour or test driving a car. Users will realise the benefits once they give it a shot and then hopefully continue to use it.&rdquo; Just Eat has resorted to online promotions and hyper local offline promotions when it comes to marketing. &ldquo;Budget is not a constraint as we have investors who keep us going.&rdquo; At the moment, Just Eat claims to spend #250-300 per customer in terms of marketing.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="app 6" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-07/1420621349.jpg" alt="VVS Mani" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">"We do not want to offer discounts at our expense since that does not make for good business" - VSS Mani, CEO, Justdial</p>\n<p class="p3">But with predatory pricing looming large over just about everything sold in the food space, most of these companies are struggling to survive. Just Eat still has to break even and the others claim discounts are bleeding them dry. Mani says, &ldquo;If restaurants offer discounts, then we provide them to the users. But we don&rsquo;t want to offer discounts at our expense since that does not make for good business.&rdquo; Adds Javeri, &ldquo;There is an ongoing discounting war in the market. With restaurant chains offering massive discounts, why would anyone order through anybody else? This sort of competition creates an unsustainable market.&rdquo; Kapur whittles down the issue further, &ldquo;We offer discounts that we can live with. We ask ourselves, will the customer still be happy when they are offered the food at the regular non-discount price? How long will the restaurants be able to sustain themselves with constant discounting?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Marketing efforts aside, when it comes to Play Store downloads, the likes of Foodpanda, Zomato and Justdial still dominate the space, with Justdial offering consumers a lot more than food delivery online. Foodpanda gets 60,000-70,000&nbsp;visitors every day on an average, with more than 50% of them new visitors, and has seen 100% QoQ growth in sales across India. With 500,000+ downloads from the Play Store, co-founder and MD, Rohit Chadda says that Foodpanda &ldquo;helps consumers navigate through a variety of restaurants that deliver in their vicinity and offers them the option of paying online, which isn&rsquo;t possible while ordering by telephone. Moreover, we have seen higher customer retention among app users as compared with web users.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Many users say they are still not too comfortable with food delivery apps in any form. As with most e-commerce trends, there seems to be an initial skepticism surrounding the idea of ordering food online. Since food is an impulse buy, they don&rsquo;t want to take the risk of not being able to communicate the order right. For those who didn&rsquo;t scoff when asked if they use the apps and had actually experienced the wonders of ordering food on their mobiles, the biggest problem was still the reach of these restaurants. In a country that is bulging at the seams with eateries, these apps have to constantly keep updating their reach. Kolkata-based student Aman Gupta, who trawls the net for the cheapest deals, says, &ldquo;I order a <em>thali</em> for dinner every night from a place called Pehelwan Dhaba. Unless apps are able to provide that level of coverage, I will stick to my phone.&rdquo; Media professionals like Aashish D&rsquo;mello and Bushra Faiz say they hate the minimum delivery requirements on such applications, given that the limit doesn&rsquo;t exist or is lower when the order is placed over the phone. Faiz adds that the constant spam mails after registering for apps are quite irritating as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="app 7" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-07/1420621424.jpg" alt="talking head" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"If the fod delivery doesn''t match expectations, there is no discount that can bring customers back" - Hemchandra Javeri, Forum Synergies</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In a marketplace that has seen a glut of local and national players, it will be difficult to predict how these companies plan to remain at the top of their game at the moment. Though all the players involved are comfortable with their current strategies, it is unclear who will take pole position in the food apps space. Explains Javeri, &ldquo;The core of this industry is customer delight; the app is secondary. If the food delivery doesn&rsquo;t match expectations, there is no discount that can bring them back.&rdquo; And thus continues the fight among the various players for their slice of the food delivery apps pie.&nbsp;</p>', 'There''s a slew of food delivery apps in the market.

(23, 12, '', 'Hospitable Terrain', '<p class="p1">Over the years, the hospitality segment has seen its fair share of drama &mdash; contentious deals, old-school rivalries, talent poaching and even the odd distress sale. But perhaps the most surprising twist in the tale was Leela Hotels&rsquo; decision to go in for debt restructuring late last year in an attempt to whittle down its bloated Rs 4,300 crore worth of debt. Few funds seem to be interested in stepping in to bail out an industry that has seen &mdash; in recent years &mdash; an oversupply of high-priced hotel rooms and low demand for the same. But not all hope is lost for the beleaguered hospitality sector &mdash; since 2013, the industry has seen seven cases of private equity (PE) investment, six of which were specifically in the mid-market segment. At a time when the market is crying out for cheaper hotels, this comes as a welcome trend.</p>\n<p class="p3">The most recent investment in the mid-market segment was quite a high-profile buy, with World Bank arm IFC investing in SAMHI Hotels, which has developed three- and four-star properties in the past and which counts the Marriott and Sheraton chains among its clients. Says Ashish Jakhanwala, MD and CEO, SAMHI Hotels, &ldquo;While there is very little capital in the mid-market segment, the opportunity to grow is huge. There are at least 10 cities in the country that are growing rapidly but lack good quality, affordable lodging. Also, as the new government is working towards a resurgence in the manufacturing sector, cities with manufacturing capacities will require affordable lodging as well.&rdquo; To buttress his point, he points out that China&rsquo;s affordable lodging segment grew 50 times when their manufacturing sector saw a spurt in growth.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="hotels 1" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-07/1420632891.jpg" alt="graphic" width="850" height="580" />What is also working in favour of hotel players is the growing domestic travel market. Joy Biswas, senior investment officer, manufacturing, agribusiness and services, IFC, says, &ldquo;With rapidly growing domestic travel, there are now around 400 million budget-minded, quality-conscious travelers, who account for an estimated two-thirds of hotel demand in India.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Interestingly, PE exits in the mid-market space show a mixed trend. There have been four exits (both partial and complete in the last year alone, with two of the deals being buybacks. Clearwater Capital had invested $10 million (Rs 47 crore) in 2006 in Sayaji Hotels and further increased its stake through an open offer to take its&nbsp; total <br /> holding to 32%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Last year, it sold its entire stake through a promoter buyback. According to VCCircle estimates, Clearwater made 72% return in rupee terms and around 60% in dollar terms on the $16 million (Rs 81 crore) that it got from the sale. Contrast this with Temasek which had to take a haircut of 50% on its investment when it partially exited its six-year old investment in Graviss Hospitality, which owns InterContinental Marine Drive, at Rs 27 a share in 2013 through a buyback against its investment of around Rs 57 a share. The Singapore-based fund continues to hold 9.96% in Graviss Hospitality of the shrunk capital base post buyback.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="hotels 2" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-07/1420632944.jpg" alt="Ashish J" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"This business needs capital and competence. It would be effective to build affordable hotels in smaller cities" - Ashish Jakhanwala, managing director and CEO, SAMHI Hotels</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Still, Jakhanwala believes the potential is too big to ignore. &ldquo;This business needs capital, competence and financial discipline. It would be far more effective to build more affordable hotels in smaller cities,&rdquo; he points out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Another factor that ensures a brighter future for the segment &mdash; the rupee depreciation crippling local industry translates into good news for tourists planning their next India tour. The recent fall of the rupee has coincided with an influx of tourists in hubs such as Goa and Agra, among other smaller centres, pushing the need to expand in the mid-market segment. With World Travel &amp; Tourism Council estimates projecting $121.4 billion of economic activity in India by 2015, thanks to the tourism industry, and with the hospitality sector potentially earning $24 billion in foreign exchange over the same time period, mid-market seems to be the best parking spot for PE funds, for now. <span class="s2"><br /></span></p>', 'Private equity investors seem to have found a sweet spot in the hospitality business — mid-market hotels', '16', '', 0, '', 'hospitable-terrain-23', 18, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Hospitable Terrain', 'Private equity investors seem to have found a sweet spot in the hospitality business — mid-market hotels', '', '', '', 'mid-market hotels,SAMHI Hotels,Leela Hotel,Clearwater Capital,Sayaji Hotels,Temasek,Graviss Hospitality', 0, NULL, '2014-12-19 16:20:18', '2015-01-07 17:47:39', '2014-11-14', 0);

(24, 12, '', 'Catching ''em young', '<p class="p1">Halt at a signal in any city across India and you will see sellers clutching a bunch of bright, helium-filled balloons of cartoons such as Angry Birds, Doraemon or Chhota Bheem, knocking on car windows in the sweltering heat. Though it is an attractive sight for most kids &ndash; the audience they aim for &mdash; it draws mixed reactions from Rajiv Chilaka, founder and managing director of Hyderabad-based Green Gold Animation, and creator of Chhota Bheem. &ldquo;These balloons are fake and are imported from China. Each one sold on the roadside is a loss to our company,&rdquo; he says indignantly before wryly accepting that, &ldquo;This is the situation in all cities, at most signals. But what you see is a reflection of how popular the show and the character is.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Certainly, Chhota Bheem is arguably the most successful animated character created by an Indian company. The perennially nine-year-old boy, who with his friends, saves the city and the king of Dholakpur episode after episode, was created by Chilaka&rsquo;s team in 2003 and after facing repeated rejections for five years, was aired on the then-struggling Pogo TV in 2008. Six years since, &ldquo;Chhota Bheem has remained the no. 1 or no. 2 show every year in its category,&rdquo; says a proud Chilaka. In 2011, Green Gold Animation started cashing in on its blockbuster character, licensing its use across categories such as comic books, action figures, stationery, F&amp;B, apparel and furnishings. In the past three years, Green Gold has transformed from a bunch of talented animators to a licensing and merchandising (L&amp;M) company. Revenue has been growing at 20% a year for the past two years with L&amp;M contributing 40% to the top line. The Chhota Bheem merchandise is now available at 12,000 stores across the country and Green Gold has also set up 30 exclusive retail outlets for the children&rsquo;s brand &mdash; something even the big daddies of children&rsquo;s merchandising, Disney and Turner, have not attempted so far. But this is not to say that they&rsquo;re lagging behind when it comes to the children&rsquo;s L&amp;M market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421052997.jpg" alt="Rajiv Chilaka" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Chhota Bheem has remained the no.1 or no.2 show every year in its category since it was first aired on Pogo TV in 2008" - Rajiv Chilaka, CEO and MD, Green Gold Animation&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Estimated at Rs 3,000 crore and growing at 15% every year, the domestic L&amp;M market is slowly coming of age. More importantly, with retail taking off in a big way in India, retail chains such as Shoppers Stop, Pantaloons, Westside and Lifestyle too, have started stocking up on kids&rsquo; merchandise. It&rsquo;s not surprising that Disney was among the first international brands to step into the Indian L&amp;M market in 2005 &mdash; it is the largest retail character licensor in the world, earning $45 billion in global character merchandised retail sales in 2013. &ldquo;In a way, we have pioneered character merchandising and the market has been evolving over the years in India. These are still early days, but we have scaled up since we started and are at a reasonable position at this point,&rdquo; says Abhishek Maheshwari, vice-president and head (consumer products), Disney India. With characters such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Princess and Marvel&rsquo;s Avengers, Disney currently has 3,000 SKUs across six categories under licence, from sheets and towels, to soft toys, fruit juice and bicycles. Last year, the company earned upward of Rs 1,000 crore (retail value) from this vertical alone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Another stalwart of the children&rsquo;s L&amp;M world also indicates that things are looking up. Turner, with its Cartoon Network Entertainment (CNE) and Pogo channels, has 8,000 SKUs over 53 categories, such as back-to-school (stationery), publishing and home entertainment. &ldquo;Since 2009, we have grown three times, achieving a high double-digit growth. We have done well in expanding the category and taking it to smaller towns,&rdquo; says Anand Singh, director, CNE, South Asia, Turner International India. With a presence in over 400 towns, Singh expects CNE-branded merchandise to clock revenue of over Rs 1,000 crore in the current fiscal. Jiggy George of Dream Theatre, which represents WWE wrestling, Warner Bros, Saban (Power Rangers), Angry Birds, Mr. Men, Noddy, Discovery, Animal planet and DreamWorks, points out that the market for merchandise has gone beyond the usual suspects and today, a lot more merchandise opportunity exists because of new characters becoming popular on TV.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="Cartoon Network" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421053582.jpg" alt="Anand Singh" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Since 2009, Turner has grown three times.

According to Chitra Johri, vice-president, Bradford License, which facilitates licensing for companies in India, &ldquo;In the past two years, the industry has seen more action. We have seen sports franchises such as NBA and Ferrari licensing its products, ditto for Bollywood production houses such as Yash Raj and Red Chillies Entertainment acquiring licenses for its movie characters.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">What is also working in the industry&rsquo;s favour is the increasing awareness among consumers and retailers. As media options other than television &mdash; internet, mobile phones and social media &mdash; gain popularity, media companies have several avenues to build their children-based brands. Ankur Bisen, senior vice-president, retail and consumer products, Technopak, points out, &ldquo;Awareness of characters has grown and this has created more opportunity for merchandising even as household incomes have increased.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Coming of age</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Internationally, L&amp;M is a huge business. Brand licensing is estimated to be a $150 billion (Rs 9 trillion) retail market globally and is growing at 5% to 10% in developed markets and 10% to 15% in developing markets. Disney (including Marvel, which it acquired in 2009), Turner and Viacom are the big players in this industry.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">India&rsquo;s been a little late to the game but increasingly, consumer-product companies are realising that pester power works even better when brand communication happens through a character children already relate to. Licensing in India happens through both the product and promotion route. Under product licensing, a licensee is given the licence to manufacture and sell a character-based product for three to six years. Promotional licensing is when a licensee allows a product company, such as an FMCG company, to use a licensor&rsquo;s character to promote its product. While product licensing is bread-and-butter for both Disney and Turner &mdash; since a contract is active for anywhere between three and six years &mdash; promotional licensing, which runs over three to nine months, has a tactical advantage. Currently, product licensing contributes around 80% to Disney&rsquo;s L&amp;M revenue and 70% to Turner&rsquo;s. For instance Big Bazaar has been selling bedsheets, footwear, and school bags among others under the Disney franchisee for the past four years at its 170 stores. Hiru Thakurdas, CEO, home fashion and accessories, Big Bazaar says, &ldquo;Disney merchandise has been helping us increase sales by 25-30% every year for the past three years. It&rsquo;s easier to push a merchandise product rather than a commodity.&rdquo; Says Singh, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just about sales, but the benefit of associating with established brands that promotional licensing brings in that entices licensees to pursue this route. When Turner is associated with, say, a Kraft or Kellogg, there&rsquo;s a positive rub-off on the property or character. It&rsquo;s a win-win for both.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Do&rsquo;s and dont&rsquo;s</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Character merchandise may be taking off now, but it&rsquo;s not an easy strategy to adopt, either for the brand or the licensor. &ldquo;The single-biggest challenge for brand licensors is that there are very few high quality licensees who are governed by high standards of integrity, manufacturing, sales and distribution and high degree of corporate governance,&rdquo; declares Saugato Bhowmik, senior vice-president (consumer products), Viacom 18 Media, which handles Nickelodeon under its fold with popular characters like Spongebob Squarepants, Motu Patlu and Dora the Explorer. The channel has close to 100 product categories in the market, over 300 SKUs ranging between Rs 5 to Rs 7,000 and a presence across 200 cities and towns.</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421054971.jpg" alt="bhowmick" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"There are very few licenses governed by high standards of integrity, manufacturing, sales and distribution" - Saugato Bhowmik, SVP, consumer products, Viacom 18 Media</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Promoting popular characters may seem like a lot of effort, but companies have learnt the hard way that treating characters simply as IP and giving out licences does not guarantee revenue. &ldquo;Many owners think they can license a brand without building it. Often brands, very big in other parts of the world, are launched in India without building them here first,&rdquo; says George. That said, Dream Theatre has a constant dialogue with Rovio (creators of Angry Birds) as to what the product and consumer strategy in India should be. &ldquo;With Angry Birds, we don&rsquo;t do deals with pre-schools. Once we sign contracts, we have a creative team that works with them to ensure the integrity of brand is maintained,&rdquo; says George.</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s actually the key, normally. As the clamour for a character rises, so does the number of enquiries and requests for licences. &ldquo;You have to ensure the franchise is not over-exposed and also that you don&rsquo;t enter the wrong categories,&rdquo; says Turner&rsquo;s Singh. &ldquo;We want to scale up the business but at the same time we don&rsquo;t want to be seen as an IP owner who is willing to sign up any business just for the sake of money.&rdquo; For example, Ben 10, an action adventure property, will never make its way to soft toys. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because he is not a huggable toy,&rdquo; Singh explains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="Disney India" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421053397.jpg" alt="Abhishek Maheshwari" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"What works for Disney is that licensees know our characters are here today and will stay five years from now. They can invest in them" - Abhishek Maheshwari, VP and head, consumer products, Disney India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">At Disney, the focus is on creating long-term relationships with licensees &mdash; some of its licensees such as HM International and Funskool have been associated with the company since it set up shop in India. &ldquo;We look at long-term because that&rsquo;s how our characters are &mdash; they are timeless; they are not just a flavour of the season. Globally, what works for Disney is the fact that licensees know that Mickey Mouse is here today and will stay five years from now. They can invest in these characters,&rdquo; says Maheshwari.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Improving visibility</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Disney&rsquo;s strategy has proved effective because the American animation giant has been consistently putting its money where its mouth is &mdash; over the decades, the company has invested billions in building its characters and ensuring their marketability. &ldquo;Content is our biggest tool to build awareness. In India, we have the platform to reach our audience, whether it is through our eight TV channels, movies, studios or digital reach. We also do events and activations. We don&rsquo;t think of marketing in isolation but as one of the drivers of affinity for our characters,&rdquo; says Maheshwari</p>\n<p class="p3">The company has also been working with local production houses and taking the co-production and IP ownership approach in local characters such as Arjun and Veer. &ldquo;We are working on a number of shows and local characters for our channels. As they mature, we will take them downstream through consumer-products business,&rdquo; Maheshwari adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">For its part, Nickelodeon has been deploying a mix of marketing strategies to reach potential partners and fans, including city tours and toon meets. &ldquo;We got Dora the Explorer, who pre-schoolers love, to do an eight-city tour for the launch of a back-to-school range in 2013. Similarly, we roped in Mandira Bedi to travel with us to launch a Spongebob Squarepants line of t-shirts,&rdquo; Bhowmik lists.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Similarly, Dream Theatre takes responsibility for media content as well. &ldquo;In the case of Pokemon, we have the rights for TV as well as marketing. So, we syndicated the content on Disney, while the show is aired on Hungama channel. Once we have built a character on TV, we look at licensing it from the next year. Brands are built over a long period of time &ndash; it&rsquo;s not an in and out strategy,&rdquo; George says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421053784.jpg" alt="Jiggy George" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We license a character on TV a year after we build it. Brands are built over a period of time &mdash; it''s not an in and out strategy" - Jiggy George, Founder, &amp; CEO, Dream Theatre&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Chilaka understands that well. Chhota Bheem is already six years old and it remains to be seen how long his mom&rsquo;s magic laddoos can keep him &mdash; and his young viewers &mdash; charged up. &ldquo;We have been trying innovative things,&rdquo; says Chilaka, pointing to the feature films based on the character that was released in 2011 and 2012.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Banking on retail</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">A huge challenge common to both licensors and licensees is the retail ecosystem, or rather the lack of it. While the latent demand for character merchandise is huge, what is lacking is a robust organised retail and a general retail network. &ldquo;Look at Australia for instance &mdash; licensing is much easier to handle because there are only four national-level chains, unlike India, where distribution is vast,&rdquo; says Singh. It&rsquo;s perhaps too vast a problem, which is why IP-owning companies restrict themselves to licensing &ndash; the licensee gets the products manufactured from certified factories and passes them on to distributors and retailers. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The exception here is Green Gold. Even when it was purely an animation player, the company knew it had to get into merchandising quickly but reaching out to partners wasn&rsquo;t easy. Green Gold formed and set up its own L&amp;M company and distribution platform. The strategy was to focus on both organised and unorganised retail. After interacting directly with customers and understanding just what children thought of Chhota Bheem, in 2011, the company started its own retail outlet. &ldquo;When you distribute, it takes longer for the money to come back. From a super stockist to a distributor and then a retailer, it takes three to six months for your money to come back to you. So we decided to do our own retail; our money comes back to us by the end of the month,&rdquo; explains Chilaka. Currently, there are 30 stores that hawk 3,000 SKUs between Rs 10 and Rs 2000. With an average size of around 250 square feet, the stores, besides metros, are also present in smaller cities such as Chandigarh, Agartala, Jaipur, Patna, Indore and Kakinada.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421055091.jpg" alt="graphic 1" width="850" height="580" />Other L&amp;M players are yet to dip their toes in the retail business. While Turner&rsquo;s Singh calls Chhota Bheem &lsquo;a case study for us&rsquo;, Disney&rsquo;s Maheshwari reasons, &ldquo;We continue to evaluate the exclusive store model. Given where our scale of business is at this point, it will make sense for us to continue to partner with modern trade and e-commerce stores.&rdquo; But IP owners don&rsquo;t just license their characters and forget about them till renewal time. Disney, for instance, works actively with retailers such as Hamley&rsquo;s and Big Bazaar to ensure its products are displayed properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Unlike developed countries, theme parks such as Disneyland are absent in India. In the absence of such multiple channels of distribution, the L&amp;M industry has to largely feed off the retail market in India, primarily through big retail chains which are far and few. &ldquo;If you have a Disney theme park, which is a great way of engaging, people will buy when they visit,&rdquo; points out Pinaki Ranjan Mishra partner and national leader (retail and consumer products), Ernst &amp; Young. Also the licensor&rsquo;s partners are small and medium enterprises, whose ability to expand and invest capital may be limited.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Piracy kills</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Like many other IP-driven industries in emerging markets, children&rsquo;s merchandising is also hit by piracy. Industry estimates that the grey market is six times the size of the legitimate, branded merchandising market. &ldquo;At times, counterfeits are available in some places even before our licensees launch a character&rsquo;s merchandise,&rdquo; says Maheshwari.</p>\n<p class="p3">Green Gold has come up with an ingenious solution to the problem of fakes. &ldquo;We have a team that works on raids. In the past, we have converted the people whom we raided into partners. We don&rsquo;t want to send them to jail,&rdquo; says Chilaka. But the shortcoming with fakes is that while it may come at half the price of original products, they lag behind in terms of quality and variety.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But piracy won&rsquo;t go away unless the pricing challenge in India is conquered. &ldquo;India is a price conscious market. Let&rsquo;s say Disney wants to sell Barbie &ndash; to have huge penetration, it must price it at Rs 25-30. But that&rsquo;s not viable. They need to find a price point where they can sustain even at low margins with scale,&rdquo; points out Pinaki Ranjan Mishra of Ernst &amp; Young.</p>\n<p class="p3">Dream Theatre&rsquo;s George believes that the situation is a reflection of the industry&rsquo;s failing. &ldquo;It is a function of demand and supply. If you don&rsquo;t supply enough, people will buy fake ones. So first, ensure that you are servicing the market. Second, build a strategy that is not elitist. Go mass and try to address all price points,&rdquo; he sums up.&nbsp;</p>', 'The domestic licensing and merchandising market for kids is coming of age as franchisees look at novel ways to monetise toons', '9', '', 0, '', 'catching-em-young-24', 19, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Catching ''em young', 'The domestic licensing and merchandising market for kids is coming of age as franchisees look at novel ways to monetise toons', '', '', '', 'Licensing & merchandise,Green Gold Animation,kids'' merchandise,Disney India,Turner International India,Bradford License,Viacom18 media,Dream Theatre', 0, NULL, '2014-12-19 16:37:09', '2015-01-12 15:01:50', '2014-11-14', 0),

While the company is undertaking initiatives to make GP an attractive place for women to work, the recruiting team ensures that there are high-quality resumes from women available when a position opens up.

(26, 16, '', 'A slow spin', '<p class="p1">At 76, Wilbur Ross is showing no signs of slowing down. The distressed asset investor, who manages over $7 billion in assets through his New York-based investment firm WL Ross &amp; Co, is looking to raise over $2 billion by floating a new PE fund. The reason is not that hard to fathom &mdash; an investor who made his billions buying stressed assets across steel, banks, coal, auto and textiles is now rubbing his hands in glee at the prospect of picking up stocks of distressed small and mid-cap Canadian and US energy companies. The sudden meltdown in crude oil, which hit an four-year low of $88, has had a debilitating impact on these companies. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for things that are idiosyncratically distressed, where we believe the long-term fundamentals are in place,&rdquo; Ross has been quoted as saying. The rationale for zeroing on these companies is Ross&rsquo; belief that, in the long run, oil has to recover and that would mean that today&rsquo;s out-of-favour stocks will get re-rated.</p>\n<p class="p2">While Ross has an uncanny knack for hitting the right notes in distressed investing, not all his plays have been a home run. In case of steel, Ross merged five bankrupt US steel companies into what was called as the International Steel Group, later sold to Mittal Steel in 2004 for $4.5 billion, giving Ross a 13x return on his investment. But Ross&rsquo; foray into textiles ended in an anti-climax. In 2003, he entered the business by buying out one of America&rsquo;s biggest textile companies, Burlington Industries (which went bankrupt in 2001) and Cone Industries. He merged both these companies to form a new entity, the International Textile Group (ITG). Three years later, Ross merged ITG with another company, Safety Components International (SCI), a publicly listed airbag maker that was a part of his portfolio. The merger resulted in a lawsuit from SCI shareholders, who alleged that Ross used the merger to bail out ITG by shelling out $150 million for a &lsquo;worthless&rsquo; company. Ross settled the suit late last year for $81 million. In other words, the textile bet did not quite work out for the legendary investor.</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421056850.jpg" alt="img 1" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p2">If one were to draw a parallel with ITG, Ross had bought out OCM in a similar fashion in 2006 from Arcil, a leading asset reconstruction company in India. Previously owned by the SK Birla group, the suiting company was sold to Ross for Rs 170 crore ($37 million). At the time of the acquisition, Ross had said, &ldquo;OCM establishes us in India&rsquo;s textile sector and adds to the resources and synergies of our textile holdings.&rdquo; Seven years since the acquisition was made, Ross has still not been able to turn around the Amritsar-based tweed company, despite having made a quick exit from his second investment in India &mdash; in 2008, Ross purchased Spicejet and sold the business two years later to Kalanithi Maran of Sun group for a tidy profit.</p>\n<p class="p2">David L Wax, managing director of WL Ross &amp; Co and member of its investment committee, is cognisant of the extended timeline at OCM. &ldquo;Yeah, it has taken longer than anticipated. I think that&rsquo;s a function of having the right management on board and we now have the right management here,&rdquo; says Wax, who was on a flying visit to India. For now, all the action at OCM is being steered by Ross&rsquo; man on the ground, Nitin Jain, who took over as the CEO last year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421056196.jpg" alt="David" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"It has taken longer than anticipated. It''s a function of the right management but we now have the right team here" - David L Wax, Managing director, WL, Ross &amp; Co</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">OCM has a rather interesting history &mdash; it started off in 1924 as a manufacturer of hand-knotted carpets and was called Oriental Carpet Manufacturers before being renamed as OCM. But it was only towards the late &rsquo;80s and early &rsquo;90s that the brand came of age, with its classic &lsquo;OCM, oh see him&rsquo; commercial enjoying top of mind recall among youngsters from that particular generation. The visuals of a suit-clad man walking confidently as passers-by gaped in awe firmly linked success with the choice of suit. This tagline captured the mood of the moment, turning the-then Birla-owned OCM into one of the most popular suiting brands in the country.</p>\n<p class="p2">But over the past decade or so, the Indian textiles market has seen a sea change, with consumers opting for readymade garments to fabric even in the suiting category, giving fabric makers such as OCM a tough time. Even the edge that domestic textile makers had in international markets has eroded over the years; India has been consistently losing out to firms in Vietnam, Bangladesh and other low-wage nations. Further, the global downturn that followed the sub-prime crisis was the final nail in the coffin for textile exporters as demand shrank and large retailers increasingly squeezed suppliers to the last dollar. In those ensuing years, OCM&rsquo;s parent Birla VXL came under stress and finally landed in the lap of Arcil, which carved out OCM from the parent and sold it to Wilbur Ross in October 2006. When Ross took over OCM, the idea was to have a close association with the International Textile Group since it manufactured, sold and marketed denim, worsted wool and man-made and cotton fabrics across big markets such as the US, China, Latin America and smaller ones such as Nicaragua and Vietnam. Ross was keen to get a higher share of exports from OCM. But that clearly did not seem to work out, with ITG itself losing its way.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Finding its feet</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">As for OCM, it&rsquo;s been a slow and steady recovery. The company today operates a fibre-to-fabric worsted textile manufacturing facility at Amritsar with a spinning capacity of 8.5 million metre per year and weaving capacity of 6.5 million metre per year. It was in March 2011 that Ross brought in textile veteran SK Singhal from market leader Raymond to head the business. Jain, the current CEO, came on board as the head of sales and marketing around the same time that Singhal took over. Singhal, who had spent nearly 30 years at Raymond &mdash; OCM&rsquo;s biggest rival in the worsted fabric segment &mdash; was brought in to steer strategy changes after the old management failed to deliver over four crucial years. &ldquo;They (the previous management) fell short of the expectations of the board,&rdquo; says Jain, adding, &ldquo;The management team today is totally different from 2006.&rdquo; When Singhal retired last year, Jain was elevated to the CEO&rsquo;s role. &ldquo;The key objective was to up the skill quotient,&rdquo; says Jain on the altered strategy at OCM. More people were hired from Raymond, Mahindra and Mahindra and other groups, existing employees promoted, some others fired. As on date, OCM has about 1,500 employees.</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421056882.jpg" alt="img 2" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p2">The new management at OCM was also quick to realise that what had been lacking all these years was a sharp brand image compared with competitors such as Raymond and Reid &amp; Taylor. Leapfrog Strategy Consulting was roped in and it suggested that, OCM needed to connect with youth living in smaller towns to recharge its growth. So while branding through television and other mediums was formulated, the company also tweaked its products mix.&nbsp; &ldquo;We realised that to understand customer demand, we need to think like retailers first, and then like manufacturers,&rdquo; says Jain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">As a result, the product portfolio was expanded to include poly rayon, wool poly, all-polyester and all-wool variations. OCM didn&rsquo;t limit itself to suitings either; shirts, shawls, scarves and blankets were all added to the list. Even the design side was revamped, three new collections were released every year compared with the two earlier. Though suiting continues to dominate sales, Jain says his ambition is to let OCM be counted as more than a suiting company. OCM is being positioned as a young and fashionable brand, with its team tapping into digital and social media to lure young consumers. It has also launched a mobile app that allows buyers to view the entire range of apparel and try it online. &ldquo;I am not advertising for my existing customer, I want to add newer and younger ones through internet-based marketing,&rdquo; says Jain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Clawing back</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">In the past three years, OCM has spent #35 crore in promotion, branding, and advertising and another Rs 21 crore in refurbishing plant and machinery. Most of its business comes through its wholesalers and retailers, who hawk the company&rsquo;s fabric range &mdash; available from Rs 150 per metre to Rs 4,500 per metre. Ankit Gargya, director, Gargya Textiles, has been OCM&rsquo;s fabric wholesaler for the past 18 years. His company deals in all other brands as well and distributes to 600 retailers across Seemandhra, Telangana, Karnataka and Maharashtra. &ldquo;We kept our customers in the loop when OCM changed hands to assure them that it was going into much more professional hands. We have seen better finishing and timely deliveries in past five years,&rdquo; he says. Though Raymond is the easiest to push to customers, Gargya feels OCM has more vibrant designs. Another Delhi-based distributor, Satyendra Gupta, says, &ldquo;Raymond&rsquo;s fabric is harder, whereas OCM has a finer fabric. Their tweeds are clear winners.&rdquo; This vote of confidence is also getting reflected in the numbers. OCM has amassed a higher share in the worsted fabric market at 8%, against 5% at the time of Ross&rsquo; takeover. The worsted fabric market (wool-blended fabrics) where OCM operates is dominated by the complete man of yesteryears &mdash; Raymond still rules the category with a 65% market share.</p>\n<p class="p5"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="graphic 1" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421056905.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="580" />However, Arvind Singhal, head of retail consultancy Technopak, is skeptical and feels that the higher share is an outcome of stronger players falling off. &ldquo;Gwalior and Dinesh Suitings are a pale shadow of what they were in the &rsquo;80s and the &rsquo;90s. Reliance is hardly making worsted fabrics now and S Kumar&rsquo;s is believed to be in financial trouble. Raymond is the only strong player left. So, OCM could also have taken some market share from crumbling players,&rdquo; points out Singhal, who incidentally worked in OCM&rsquo;s marketing department in the early 1980s. When it comes to distribution strategy, OCM is cautious about burning cash and is unwilling to build a standalone retail presence, relying almost entirely on multi-brand outlets to push sales across the country. It has just four exclusive stores in four cities, compared to Raymond&rsquo;s 600.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">&ldquo;Most people who have entered the retail market in India have made losses or very little profits because of high real estate costs,&rdquo; points out Jain. He adds that trust among traders &mdash; and not exclusive retail stores &mdash; was crucial for the company&rsquo;s revival. Singhal believes the new management&rsquo;s strategy for OCM needs to be backed up &mdash; with more money. &ldquo;The owners are neither putting in &lsquo;serious money&rsquo; in the business, nor positioning it right or boosting retail presence &mdash; all crucial to the success of a textile brand. Raymond&rsquo;s biggest strength is its exclusive outlets,&rdquo; Singhal says. However, Jain sees merit in the current approach: &ldquo;We have a fiscal responsibility towards our shareholders as well. Our strategy is to be investment-selective by focusing only on essential areas.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Testing times</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">Though OCM&rsquo;s turnover in recent years has increased from less than Rs 100 crore in 2008 to over Rs 150 crore now, maintaining net profitability has turned out to be a challenge. It recorded a loss of Rs 11 crore in FY11 which fell to Rs 1 crore in FY12 but increased to Rs 5 crore in FY13. However, Jain remains confident. &ldquo;We have been cash positive for the last three years. We broke even in FY14 and will be profitable by next year,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421056550.jpg" alt="Singhal" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"With no significant amount invested in the company or brand and no advertising backing, OCM is very vulnerable" - Arvind Singhal, Chairman and managing director, Technopak</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">What could be a challenge for Jain and his team is that with exports falling, OCM will have to increasingly rely on domestic sales. In the last two years, export contribution has fallen to 20% from 35%. As a result, overall revenues have fallen 20% over the past two years to Rs 160 crore in FY14. But Jain is confident of domestic sales continuing their upward trajectory and making up for the export drop. Singhal of Technopak believes the road ahead for OCM will be far from easy. &ldquo;They are just milking the brand. With no significant amount invested in the company or brand, not backed by advertising and located in a logistically disadvantaged Amritsar, OCM is very vulnerable. I don&rsquo;t know who will buy it after revival. I guess Raymond won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he says. But for all the external skepticism, Jain is getting a long rope, internally. &ldquo;We are a very patient investor; we think Nitin and his team are doing a superb job reformulating who and what OCM is. In that regard, we want to give him the time to accomplish his agenda so that we realise the value,&rdquo; says Wax.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">As for Ross, his investment in OCM is not something that will keep him awake at night for he surely knows when to take the final call. When asked in an interview how he knew it was time to cut bait, Ross said, &ldquo;You cut bait when you are either out of plausible strategies for solving your problems or when the incremental capital needed for the proposed strategy is disproportionately large relative to what you already have committed.&rdquo; For now, that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case with OCM.&nbsp;</p>', 'How distressed investor Wilbur Ross is looking to turn around his maiden Indian investment — suiting player OCM', '9', '', 0, '', 'a-slow-spin-26', 21, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'A slow spin', 'How distressed investor Wilbur Ross is looking to turn around his maiden Indian investment — suiting player OCM', '', '', '', 'Wilbur Ross,WL Ross & Co,Oriental Carpet Manufacturers,OCM Suitings', 0, NULL, '2014-12-19 17:09:17', '2015-01-12 15:35:36', '2014-11-14', 0),

(28, 20, '', 'Divide to rule', '<p class="p1">It&nbsp;is Splitsvilla of a different kind on the Street, which has seen the benchmark Sensex appreciate by 25% in CY14. Around 82 companies have announced stock splits in the current calendar year against 71 in 2013. In the current year, 56 splits were announced in the past five months. Of the overall 82 companies, 58 are small- and mid-cap stocks with a market capitalisation of less than Rs 1,000 crore including Shivam Autotech and glass manufacturer La Opala. An indication that these companies are keen on keeping investor interest high in their stocks. The list also includes a host of private and public sector banks such as State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank besides tobacco major, Godfrey Phillips and electricals manufacturer, Havells.</p>\n<p class="p3">A stock-split lowers the face value and increases the number of shares outstanding without making any difference to the market cap. This lowering of face value creates the illusion of a lower price among retail investors. For example, Axis Bank stock was trading around Rs 2,000 when its face value was reduced from Rs 10 to Rs 2 on 28th July. The stock now trades at Rs 395. While a commonly cited reason for a stock split is to increase liquidity and accessibility to retail investors, many a times there is more than meets the eye. Hence, for many rogue promoters, the degree of reduction in the face value depends on how big an optical price illusion they want to create.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Dipen Shah, senior vice-president at Kotak Securities, says, &ldquo;Stock splits are primarily done to increase the amount of participation in the stock by making the prices lower and increasing the liquidity in the market. Fundamentally, nothing changes in the stock.&rdquo; The expanding list of companies which are opting for splits makes it clear that many companies are playing the game of wanting to make their stock price look cheaper.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;In fact, a recent media report quoted KR Kamath, CMD of Punjab National Bank as saying, &ldquo;When the stock price touches Rs 1,000, the retail investor is reluctant to buy. Hence we decided to go for a stock split to attract the retail investor.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">In quite a few cases, the split has achieved what it set out to: bring in more retail participation. &ldquo;Trading volumes typically increase after a split,&rdquo; says Shah. Among small and mid-cap companies that went in for a split last year, VKS Projects, Astral Poly Technik, Relaxo Footwear and Rasoya Proteins have shown a substantial increase in the number of retail investors. Among mid-caps, M &amp; M Financial and in large-cap, Asian Paints has seen an increase in retail participation.</p>\n<p class="p3">In theory, a split infuses liquidity and aids &lsquo;market forces&rsquo; to better discover the true price of a stock.

(29, 20, '', 'Cloud of uncertainty', '<p class="p1">In all the dross number-crunching and ratio analysis done while analysing the financial performance of a company, one key aspect is often overlooked &mdash; that little entry in the books called contingent liabilities, which actually warrants a little more than just the cursory glance thrown in its direction. In fact, the quantum of contingent liabilities has grown in recent years as an increasing number of companies have taken to obfuscating their financial obligations under this accounting term. To put things in perspective, the cumulative contingent liability of the BSE 200 companies (excluding PSUs, banks and financials) has gone up from Rs 178,789 crore in FY11 to #256,978 crore in FY14, an increase of 44% over a three-year period.</p>\n<p class="p3">A little more digging reveals that some companies have totted up liabilities in excess of their net worth and market capitalisation. On an average, these companies have contingent liabilities twice the size of their net worth and more than 100% of their market capitalisation (<em>see: Need for closer scrutiny</em>).</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421058954.jpg" alt="graphic 1" width="850" height="580" />Not surprising, then, that market experts have advocated caution. Parag Parikh, founder, PPFAS, says, &ldquo;Contingent liabilities are very important in assessing the investment-worthiness of a company, as it may erode the net worth of a firm and, in some cases, threaten its survival. It can create debts for a firm, turn a profit into a loss, change its capital structure and negatively impact a firm&rsquo;s debt-to-equity ratio. The bigger risk is when companies do not provide for an event that could become a liability in the future.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Incidentally, it is mostly power and infrastructure companies that are sitting on huge contingent liabilities on account of large debt on their books. Companies such as GVK Power, HCC and Lanco Infra are among the few with the highest contingent liability.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Sitting ducks</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">In case of GVK Power, the contingent liability of Rs 4,600 crore as of FY14 is nearly three times its market cap. Of the total amount, Rs 3,133 crore is guarantees to banks for loans taken by subsidiaries. In fact, a market source who did not wish to be named suspected that out of this figure, Rs1,800 crore was given to promoter companies for the acquisition of a mine in Australia. &ldquo;The mine acquisition (Hancock Coal) is a red flag in my opinion and I have some serious questions over what stage the acquisition is at. The promoter may own the asset but how exactly does he plan to monetise it? The mine should not end up becoming a contingent liability or a headache for the company,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">An ICICI Securities report mentions that the Hancock acquisition guarantee is an overhang. In September 2011, GVK Coal Developers &ndash; a JV between GVK (10% stake) and GVK Natural Resources acquired a coal mine from the Hancock group in Australia. The total acquisition cost was $1.26 billion for which it has tied up debt of $1 billion. GVK guaranteed 49% of the debt (Rs 6,788 crore), and as collateral pledged the shares of GVK Energy, GVK Airports and GVK Transportation. This remains a cause for concern, states the report.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421058986.jpg" alt="graphic 2" width="850" height="580" />Investors are highly concerned about this guarantee as GVK Coal is currently under development and incurring losses. Also, as per GVK Power&rsquo;s FY14 annual report, GVK Coal &lsquo;s current liabilities exceed current assets by $259 million based on unaudited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2013 and continues to look for more financial support indicating a mounting pressure on the debt servicing ability of the company. On the flipside, if the company is able to monetise some of its assets in the power, coal and other segments, which it has been talking about for quite some, these issues can ease out a little.</p>\n<p class="p3">In many a case, contingent liabilities can actually threaten the very existence of the company. Construction and realty major HCC was earlier reeling under a pile of debt, as was its flagship township project Lavasa. But today, under a CDR exercise, the company has managed to get a two-year moratorium for repaying its debt. The bulk of its total contingent liabilities of Rs 2,701 crore for FY14 were guarantees given to loans for Lavasa. Another chunk of liabilities was guarantees that were given to road projects. But while CDR has somewhat eased matters, consolidated debt is still a whopping Rs 11,443 crore in FY14. In fact, at Rs 1,091 crore, interest outgo was at a five-year high. All this puts into question the company&rsquo;s ability to service its liabilities, should the need arise. As far as contingent liabilities go, however, the key variable for HCC is that it has nearly Rs 9,000 crore filed as claims under dispute and, ever hopeful of winning the claims, the company has not listed any of these in its balance sheet. Second, as Harendra Kumar, head of research, Elara Capital, puts it, &ldquo;If the economy fails to gather steam and the infra space doesn&rsquo;t pick up in another year or two, many of the substantial loans of its subsidiaries could become NPAs and these contingents could threaten the survival of the company.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421058539.jpg" alt="kumar" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"If the economy fails to pick up, contingents could threaten the survival of firms" - Harendra Kumar, Head, research, Elara Capital</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In the case of ABG Shipyard, which is sitting on a contingent liability of Rs&nbsp;1,611 crore, or 141% of its market cap, analysts are apprehensive about the sustainability of the business, particularly in the light of subdued industry environment. Amit Agarwal of Kotak Securities mentions in his report that ABG&rsquo;s profitability is expected to be under pressure due to the poor shipbuilding market, high interest costs and increasing liabilities. &ldquo;We estimate the company to report losses over FY14 to FY16,&rdquo; says Agarwal, who has a sell rating on the stock. Against such a backdrop, contingent liabilities will prove to be a double whammy. A vast majority of contingent liabilities for FY14 were bank guarantees to subsidiaries, which the company has not provided for. Given that the company&rsquo;s three subsidiaries themselves were facing debt problems and reported falling sales and profits, their ability to repay these loans remains in question. To top it all, contingent liabilities are likely to queer the pitch. Bharat Chhoda, analyst at ICICI Securities, says, &ldquo;Going ahead, ABG definitely faces a risk from contingent liabilities.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">ABG has been feeling the heat of late, as a weak operating environment led it to post a net loss of Rs&nbsp;199 crore in FY14. Though its debt of Rs&nbsp;10,000 crore has been restructured under CDR, the company is facing serious cash flow problems due to rising raw material costs, deferral of deliveries, order cancellations and invoking of bank guarantees. The shipbuilding industry as a whole is faring no better with low demand, order cancellations and problems with financing.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421058719.jpg" alt="Agarwal" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We estimate ABG Shipyard to report losses over FY14 to FY16" - Amit Agarwal, Deputy vice-president, Kotak Securites</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In the real estate sector, the Mumbai-based DB Realty has been worst hit by this trend. The company has seen its fortunes take a knock after promoters Shahid Balwa and Vinod Goenka were arrested in the 2G scam and the company has taken a tumble ever since. With its reputation hit and very few customers coming forward to purchase its properties, inventory has piled up. As such, cash flows and profitability have been hit hard. A rejig of its management team also did not yield the desired results. Here, too, bank guarantees given to subsidiaries form the bulk of liabilities, at Rs 2,567 crore. The notable and largest liabilities of the lot are the Rs 853 crore given to Majestic Infracom, Rs&nbsp;829 crore given to Delux Hospital Mauritius and Rs&nbsp;350 crore given to Neel Kamal Realtors. To Majestic Infracom, it has provided collateral securities for Hotel Hilton, which forms a part of its inventory. In the case of the second property, it has received irrevocable guarantees from two DB directors. To the third subsidiary, a parcel of land in Byculla and the Orchid project were provided as surety. &ldquo;These contingents pose a risk to DB, combined with weak sales, and delays in execution due to delays in approvals of the parent and fundamental problems with <br /> its subsidiaries,&rdquo; says Amit Anwani, analyst at KC Research. He feels that DB may not be in a position to service its guarantees and this could turn out to be a serious investment risk.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Living with uncertainty</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Well, thankfully, disclosure norms are improving. Parikh adds that in the past, most contingent liabilities were not disclosed due to lax regulation but today, firms are forced to disclose their liabilities.</p>\n<p class="p3">Also, the market tends to ascribe a lower valuation to these companies. A example is that of Ranbaxy, which saw its P/E halve from 30 times to 15 on account of court cases pending against it in the US. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In case of smaller companies that wish to show larger profits, there is scope for accounting jugglery and they may not provide for these liabilities. Were the liability to actually arise, they would have to knock it off their reserves or charge it to the profit and loss account, which could mean a huge setback for existing shareholders of the company. So, the next time you zoom in on a stock, pay heed to any lurking contingent liability.&nbsp;</p>', 'Investors need to be cautious as an increasing number of companies are reporting higher contingent liabilities and may go belly up if the liabilities materialise', '11', '', 0, '', 'cloud-of-uncertainty-29', 24, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Cloud of uncertainty ', 'Investors need to be cautious as an increasing number of companies are reporting higher contingent liabilities and may go belly up if the liabilities materialise', '', '', '', 'Contingent Liabilities,GVK Power,HCC,ABG Shipyard,DB Realty', 0, NULL, '2014-12-19 18:02:47', '2015-01-12 16:06:49', '2014-11-14', 0),
(30, 20, '', 'Battling the odds', '<p class="p1">Moving from a small town in Uttar Pradesh to England to study aeronautical engineering and then the ascent to become a realty czar owning a bevy of luxury cars and a private jet, not to mention India&rsquo;s largest real estate development company, having a market capitalisation of Rs 1.8 lakh crore at its peak in 2008, reads more like a script out of one of Bollywood&rsquo;s typical rags to riches movies. Yet that is the true life story of Kushal Pal Singh, the man behind real estate behemoth DLF.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It is also a journey filled with a determination to succeed against the odds as can be evinced by two examples. In the 1970s a Haryana chief minister blocked clearances for DLF&rsquo;s projects in its bastion of Gurgaon. None the less, today it is its largest market. Similarly Singh also campaigned vigorously (and successfully) to change the guidelines of the Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act in DLFs favour, an act which changed its fortunes.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421059536.jpg" alt="graphic 1" width="850" height="580" />It is such resolve and pluckiness that Singh will have to draw upon and demonstrate to extract DLF from the mess that it has got into of late. Recently, DLF&rsquo;s stock price tanked about 30% in a single day to an all-time low of Rs 100 after market regulator Sebi issued a diktat banning the company from accessing the capital markets for a period of three years. (The watchdog&rsquo;s investigation, on the basis of a complaint filed by Kimsuk Krishna Sinha, found that DLF had not disclosed a police complaint filed in 2007 against its subsidiary Sudipti Estates in the prospectus of its IPO in the same year. Further it was found that the company&rsquo;s claim of Sudipti not being its subsidiary and being sold off was untrue along with similar claims of several subsidiary companies being sold, with the money trail being traced back to the wives of several of its key managerial personnel.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The company has already challenged the order in the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) and, if need be, will challenge it in the Supreme Court but Sebi&rsquo;s ban has clearly spooked investors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Domino effect</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">For one, access to funding becomes a challenge. Post the order, DLF cannot participate in any listed issuance such as equity, preferential allotments, debt or REITs in either the primary or secondary market for the next three years. It also can&rsquo;t float any collateralised mortgage backed securities or non-convertible debentures, something that it has actively been doing over the past six months.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Second, it also puts into jeopardy DLF&rsquo;s plans to pare its debt. Driven by asset sales, its debt has come down from Rs 21,677 crore in FY10 to around Rs 19,064 crore currently, but, given that the company is not making enough cash from operations, investors are worried about DLF&rsquo;s ability to service its interest cost. &ldquo;In Q1FY15, DLF&rsquo;s net debt increased by Rs 540 crore to Rs 19,000 crore despite non-core inflows of Rs 240 crore, highlighting that operations continue to consume cash. Q1FY15 operating cash flow and other income of Rs 520 crore remains short of cash interest outgo of Rs 760 crore,&rdquo; says Atul Tiwari, analyst, Citi Research.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421059621.jpg" alt="img 2" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">Importantly, this comes at a time when the real estate market is beaten down and expected to remain sluggish. Also, given that it has 57 million square feet of projects under construction, the company needs Rs 2,500 crore annually to fund the construction of its projects. Given that volume growth has been muted for long owing to a slowdown in sales from the Gurgaon region &mdash; its primary customer base &mdash; any further slowdown in construction will severely hurt its future revenue streams and cash flows which are already weakened. In Q1FY15 DLF&rsquo;s sales and net profit declined by 25% and 29% respectively on a year-on-year basis. It did not manage to generate any free cash flow owing to its land parcel acquisitions and interest payments. &ldquo;DLF&rsquo;s commercial properties are doing fine but the residential property volume has been very poor for the past three years as compared to other players such as Godrej and Mahindra. They have sold just Rs 300 crore of property in each of the last two quarters. If the real estate market doesn&rsquo;t pick up, especially in its key Gurgaon belt, and if the company doesn&rsquo;t launch new projects then it will be a difficult act for the company to claw back from its present difficulties,&rdquo; says Adhidev Chattopadhyay, analyst, HDFC Securities. To put things into perspective, while DLF had targeted new sales of 7.5 million square feet (msf) in FY15, it sold only 0.4 msf in the first quarter of FY15.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421059661.jpg" alt="graphic 2" width="850" height="580" />The realtor&rsquo;s interest outgo in FY14 stood at nearly Rs 2,500 crore, which was 61% of its operating profit. Apart from this, the company is also incurring capex and land acquisition of Rs 500 crore each year. In order to improve its cash flows, the company has resorted to selling some of its non-core assets including its convention center at Dwarka, commercial assets in Pune and Noida, a few land parcels and wind energy and power assets. By selling off Aman Resorts and the insurance business, DLF has managed to raise capital to the tune of Rs 5,500 crore and pare gross debt by Rs 5,000 crore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In light of the adverse regulatory development, most analysts are expecting that DLF will have to further rely on asset sales. &ldquo;When you have heavy debt, corporate governance issues and little to no political leverage, there will be selling of assets. Distress sales may happen as many parties are interested in buying their assets at lower prices,&rdquo; says Gaurav Parikh, managing director, Jeena Scriptech.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Counter attack</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">In such a gloomy scenario what can Singh and his team do to turn the company&rsquo;s fortunes? Aashiesh Agarwaal, who tracks the company at Edelweiss Securities, offers a few clues. &ldquo;Whatever plans the promoters had to divest and dilute their stake in order to raise equity for debt reduction will not happen now. Aside from private equity, DLF can sell some of its land parcels or rental assets. They could also tap loans from banks and NBFCs,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">A hidden ace for DLF could be the enhanced cash flow from the rental business as it is through with most of the capital expenditure planned for the rental business. That cash can now be utilised as working capital for its incomplete projects. The management estimates an operating income of around Rs&nbsp;<span class="s2">2,500</span> crore from rentals over the next three years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421059707.jpg" alt="graphic 3" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">The Sebi ban isn&rsquo;t the only regulatory uncertainty surrounding the stock. On the basis of a complaint filed by one of the owners association of some of DLF&rsquo;s properties on the grounds that DLF was imposing unfair conditions on owners of apartments, the Competition Commission of India and the Competition Appellate Tribunal had imposed a Rs 650 crore penalty, nearly 7.5% of its total turnover at the time, with a stiff 9% interest charge. DLF had appealed against this order in the apex court which, unfortunately for DLF, ruled in favour of CCI. Then, on the basis of a complaint filed in the Punjab and Haryana high court that nearly 350 acres of land worth Rs 1,700 crore in Gurgaon had been acquired by DLF in a dubious manner, the court cancelled the land allotment. This matter, too, is pending in the Supreme Court. Further the company also has outstanding tax demands owing to disallowance of SEZ profits amounting to Rs 3,270 crore that could pose a huge contingent liability threat.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Collateral Damage</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The slew of litigation has cast a negative shadow on the stock as has its leverage, which is expected to balloon further. The key development, however, will be the verdict of the SAT tribunal. If the Sebi order is reversed or if, as analysts feel, the period of the ban is reduced from three years to one year, Singh can breathe a huge sigh of relief. If the SAT appeal is over-ruled and the case drags in the Supreme Court, DLF could be forced to divest a big portion of its core and non-core land parcels at a discount. The other threat that hangs over DLF in case of an unfavorable SAT ruling is its potential exclusion from the benchmark Nifty. Already, Institutional Investor Advisory Service, a proxy advisory firm is of the opinion that after the three-year Sebi ban, it is pertinent to ask whether DLF should remain a front-line index stock. &ldquo;Being part of the CNX Nifty, DLF attracts several equity retail and institutional shareholders. Index funds will also be required to hold the stock in almost the same measure as its weight in the index.

They are fearful about the sustainability of DLF&rsquo;s debt, its ability to monetise assets, the industry environment and high contingent liability sitting in the form of several litigations. &ldquo;Given the size and scale of the company, the volumes that they are doing are just not good enough. If you take into account the capex and land acquisition they do, they continue to burn cash every quarter which is not sustainable,&rdquo; says Agarwaal of Edelweiss.

(32, 24, '', 'Heart for art''s sake', '<p class="p1">In narrow, boxed-in suburban apartments in Mumbai, running out of display space for the few odd pieces of abstract art middle-class families own isn&rsquo;t all that unusual. But what do you do when your enviable collection &mdash; more modern art than calendar art &mdash; outgrows your stately New Delhi home and is at risk of being banished into storage? Former communication professional and acclaimed bridge player Kiran Nadar found a way out by parking her growing art collection inside a sprawling mall in tony Saket, New Delhi, throwing it open to the public as the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art (KNMA), the first such private and philanthropic institution in India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;The whole process took place quite by chance. I started off collecting art for my home but soon had more works than I could fit on my walls. I thought about putting them in storage or displaying them at my husband&rsquo;s office (Nadar is married to HCL founder Shiv Nadar) but realised that wasn&rsquo;t the aim I had in mind when I started collecting,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">So, Nadar altered the pace of her acquisitions and made them more museum-centric, with some help from her KNMA team, consultants and art historian Roobina Karode. Any period that she pays particular attention to? &ldquo;Well, I collect across board, our collection &mdash; though large and holistic &mdash; is steeped in the modern. This means most Indian masters such as Tyeb Mehta, MF Husain, FN Souza, SH Raza, Manjit Bawa and VS Gaitonde find a place in the museum.</p>\n<p class="p3">Despite this impressive roster and its prime location, the museum faces an age-old challenge &mdash; getting footfalls. &ldquo;In India, the museum-going public is not spontaneous, so we organise seminars, school and college programmes and talks to try and get people involved,&rdquo; Nadar avers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">This means not just bringing people to the museum but taking the museum to the public as well. With this intent, one of KNMA&rsquo;s collections is currently traveling to the Reina Sofia museum in Madrid, and from there to the MET Museum in New York. &ldquo;Though we often loan works to other museums, this is the first time a curated show is traveling to a large and well-known museum. Hopefully, in time, we will be able to set up our own building and display our collections in a larger space.&rdquo; And to fill up those eventual bare walls, Nadar and her team are working hard to expand and add depth to the collections already in place.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">However, auctions and acquisitions &mdash; the other avenue to expand the museum&rsquo;s purview &mdash; are stressful affairs for Nadar. She adds that one positive outcome of the auction process is that it is a good way to judge the price of a piece. Any pick of the lot that are dear to her? &ldquo;Oh, this is like asking someone to pick their favourite child; it&rsquo;s a very difficult question&rdquo; Nadar laughs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But some definitely make the cut &mdash; Raza&rsquo;s <em>Saurashtra</em>, which was the most expensive work she purchased (for a reported $3.5 million); the very moving <em>Shakuntala</em> by Raja Ravi Varma. Has she ever felt like restricting a purchase within the walls of her home? &ldquo;Over time, I have stopped feeling that way. I realised that I needed to be more detached from the whole process,&rdquo; says Nadar.

The Indian corporation Satyam, founded in 1987, was a phenomenal success, eventually supplying IT solutions to more than 35% of the largest five hundred companies in the world. At its peak Satyam employed nearly 50,000 people and operated in sixty-seven countries. As markets around the world collapsed in 2008, and the Indian Stock Exchange fell from a high of over 21,000 to below 8,000, Satyam continued to report positive results during most of the year.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp; The first hint of a problem came in October 2008, when the World Bank fired Satyam as a service provider and issued an eight-year ban on hiring the company. The World Bank claimed that Satyam installed spy systems on its computers and stole some of its assets. Also in October, during a public conference call that Satyam held with stock analysts, one analyst drew attention to the large cash balances that Satyam&rsquo;s owners were holding in non interest-bearing bank accounts. The owners offered no explanation. Why would the owners allow large amounts of cash to sit passively in accounts that were not accruing interest? Moreover why did the owners fail to explain this behavior when asked about it?</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp; A third hint that there were problems at Satyam occurred in December 2008, when its board of directors unanimously approved the purchase of Maytas Properties and Maytas Infrastructure, two companies that were unrelated to Satyam&rsquo;s core business. The board was unanimous in its support of the transactions, but investors were outraged. As it turned out, Satyam CEO B. Ramalinga Raju&rsquo;s Family held a larger stake in Maytas Properties and Maytas Infrastructure that it did in Satyam. Some observers suspected that the transactions were an attempt to siphon money out of Satyam and into the hands of the Raju family. As a result of the public outrage, the owners aborted the transactions. A fourth hint was the fact that CEO Raju&rsquo;s personal holdings in Satyam fell from 15.67 percent in 2005-6 to just 2.3 percent in 2009. But Satyam&rsquo;s board appeared to notice none of these strong indicators of trouble at the company.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp; After the Maytas acquisition incident, analysts put sell recommendations on Satyam&rsquo;s stock. Its shares dropped nearly 10 percent, four of the company&rsquo;s five independent directors resigned, and on December 30,2008, Forrester Research analysts advised its clients to stop giving IT business to Satyam because of growing suspicions of widespread fraud. Satyam hired Merrill Lynch for advice on how to stop the freefall of its stock price. Eight days later Merrill Lynch sent a letter to the stock exchange stating that it was withdrawing from the project because it had uncovered material accounting irregularities.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp; On January 7, 2009, Raju confessed to Satyam&rsquo;s board that he had been manipulating the company&rsquo;s books for years. He eventually confessed to overstating assets on Satyam&rsquo;s balance sheet by $1.47 billion. Indeed the company had overstated income virtually every quarter for several years. According to Raju, the manipulation had started out small but grew larger over the years. &ldquo;It was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten,&rdquo; he said... Satyam&rsquo;s auditors and board also bear responsibility for failing to see the obvious signs of wrongdoing, and they have been sued by investors for their wrongdoing.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Insights</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-size: small;">Bargaining for a better price</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: small;"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421060523.jpg" alt="Insight 1" width="850" height="580" /></span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1">The salesman pitches a product, quotes a price, after bargaining, you pay much lower than the quoted amount.

The salesman tends to sell at a lower price lower to ensure high probability of sale, which can be remedied by paying them a fixed salary.

We were tasked with blending a scotch with a superficial resemblance to the Ballantine&rsquo;s sample that lay before us. Since this followed an intense day of being guided through sniffing and tasting 14 different whiskies at the Strathisla and Glenburgie distilleries, we should have been up to recognising some distinguishing features. Was the sample fruity? Creamy? Did we get floral fragrances? A nutty taste? Was it spicy? Honey?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;In front of us lay seven drams of whiskies that we had to blend to arrive at the equivalent of Chivas Brothers&rsquo; master blenders. Whisky making is simple , at least in theory. Malted barley is ground into coarse grist, to which natural spring water is added along with yeast, which is then drained as new spirit and casked in wooden barrels over a certain number of years to create single malts. While few know that casked whiskies from the same distillery are blended to make up cases of single malt, several dozen of them go into the making of blended whiskies that we recognise as scotch.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421060761.jpg" alt="img 1" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;Scotch making traces its origin to 1494. Records show that the king at the time ordered the making of this &ldquo;water of life&rdquo; (Gaellic for whisky). But till two centuries ago, Scotland&rsquo;s finest was distilled illegally and prone to excise raids and smuggler attacks. The charming Strathisla distillery, set up in 1786, resembles something out of an Asterix comic, while the Glenlivet distillery, once tucked out of sight in the highlands from the probing eyes of officials, has been replaced with a gleaming new distillery with giant washback tanks and copper stills surrounded by picturesque low hills and meadows.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;At the heart of the Chivas Brothers empire is its Strathisla distillery, Scotland&rsquo;s oldest, but the scale and size of operations vary from the Aberlour distillery &mdash; quaintly eccentric, located next to a stream &mdash; to the Glenlivet &ldquo;factory&rdquo;, which is a mammoth operation. Bonded warehouses store the whiskies being aged in American bourbon and French sherry casks, to bring out flavours and characteristics that will finally be expertly blended to keep the world in high spirits.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-12/1421060789.jpg" alt="img 2" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;Our learning is being tested. We know that the foundation of a blended scotch is grain whisky. We use a generous volume of it to build a foundation, but its complexity is disabling. Nosing the whiskies, we arrive at our formula &mdash; the Miltonduff single malt is soft on the palate with a buttery, dry-fruity taste; the Glenburgie single malt is reminiscent of vanilla, honey and oak; the Speyside blended malt has spicy, honey tones; the highland blended malt is saucy and complex; the lowland blended malt has a light hint of something floral; the Islay is &mdash; what else? &mdash; smoky.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;Identified rightly or wrongly, we have the unenviable task of figuring out the volumes we will need to mix and match. Do we want more spice, or more sweetness? A drop more of the Islay could ruin the mellow structure we&rsquo;re aiming for? Too sweet will render it unfit as a whisky. We break up the taste by high, medium and low notes before measuring out accurate quantities and submitting the blend to the jury. How wrong have we got it?</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;Fortunately for us, Team Lahore trumps the competition. We&rsquo;ve managed &ldquo;sweetness and depth&rdquo;, a judge tells us, but before we can congratulate ourselves on our experience as master blenders, we&rsquo;re informed that our result is light years away from the sample.

This comes as a surprise, considering that the 31-year-old self-confessed foodie has been running one of India&rsquo;s most popular restaurant listing and review site for the past six years. It is safe to say that Goyal&rsquo;s creation, was an outcome of necessity: the idea struck Goyal while he was working at Gurgaon-based Bain Capital. &ldquo;There were many bachelors working with me and we didn&rsquo;t have a canteen at our office. So we ended up ordering food all the time. We had a stack of menu cards in the cafeteria,&rdquo; recalls the founder and MD of Zomato. To ease the daily who-orders-what-from-where tussle, Goyal, along with his colleague and IIT-Delhi classmate Pankaj Chaddah, scanned all the stacked menus and mailed them to all their colleagues. It worked &mdash; it helped them resolve the lunchtime chaos at Bain. Then we thought, &ldquo;But, what if we did it for the outside world?&rdquo; The thought excited the duo and in 2008, Goyal and Chaddah (now COO and co-founder) launched Foodiebay &mdash; a restaurant discovery portal.</p>\n<p class="p3">But they were in pursuit of a powerful brand name and decided to change the website name to something better. &ldquo;We wanted to keep the idea of food in focus and pick a name that is short, easy to remember and makes people think of food. Zomato&rsquo;s got a zing to it and is originally a play on the word tomato. We also wanted to avoid any confusion with ebay and not take chances when creating a brand that we would want to take international,&rdquo; shares Goyal. And so, in 2010, Foodiebay came to be called Zomato, with two tomatoes in place of the Os. In spite of a great business idea in hand, Goyal and Chaddah didn&rsquo;t quit their job until late 2009. In the early days, with work and time constraints, the duo&rsquo;s reach was restricted only to a few restaurants in Gurgaon and south Delhi. Chaddah recalls, &ldquo;I was the only sales person on the ground who would visit restaurants.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Starting with just three to four south Delhi-based restaurants, Zomato has taken quite a quantum leap since then. Today, it lists 255,700 restaurants in 51 cities across 13 countries, including 23 cities in India.

Given that our advertising model is hyper-local, businesses can display ads to hungry consumers looking for dining options in a specific area,&rdquo; explains Goyal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420537240.jpg" alt="Zomato graphic" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">A typical restaurant pays around Rs 12,000 per month for an advertisement. Prices vary from Rs 5,000 to Rs 75,000, depending on the product and placement. The reason restaurants are ready to pay is because their ads can then be displayed when someone is searching for eateries in a particular area. For instance, a customer who types in &lsquo;take-out&rsquo; restaurants in Colaba will be shown options for only that area. Zomato does not have a sales team for small towns. All the revenue from its Indian operations comes from the seven big cities &mdash; Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Pune &mdash; it is present in, with Delhi as the largest contributor, followed by Mumbai. However, Goyal is also taking Zomato to non-metros such as Bhopal, Surat, Aurangabad, Allahabad, Amritsar, Bhubaneshwar, Ranchi and Vishakhapatnam. &ldquo;We are not thinking about revenue from small cities for now. We might consider it in five years, by which time the restaurant industry will rapidly expand in these cities. Three years ago, Chandigarh had 300 restaurants; today it has 1,200. That&rsquo;s how fast these cities are growing. So, you can&rsquo;t ignore them at any cost.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">But market creation beyond metros and dealing with small restaurants is a painstaking task. Chaddah says, &ldquo;While tying up with restaurants, we have to educate them about how their online presence will result in an increase in sales. Restaurants in India don&rsquo;t take a third party seriously.&rdquo; However, Goyal believes that things have changed in the past three to four years. He says, &ldquo;Today, many people know about Zomato. In restaurants, customers themselves tell the owners about us. And, restaurant owners themselves use Zomato to conduct research on prices.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Rohit Chadda, MD, Foodpanda, believes that there is tremendous untapped potential in the online food order, discovery and review space in India. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s happening in fashion, travel, electronics and more. When it comes to food, the base is small but we have had 100% growth each quarter-on-quarter. If Domino&rsquo;s can successfully launch an online pizza ordering facility in 130 cities, it proves that people are willing to take online seriously,&rdquo; says Chadda. Unlike Foodpanda &mdash; a global online food-ordering portal present in 40 countries &mdash; Zomato has not gone as far as allowing people to order food from its website or app. It only provides information in the form of addresses, phone numbers, menus, timings, pictures and consumer reviews.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="Zomato 2" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420537608.jpg" alt="Rohit Chadda" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;"><strong>"If Domino''s can successfully launch an online ordering facility, it proves that people will take online seriously" - Rohit Chadda, managing director, Foodpanda</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">That Zomato&rsquo;s business has got a good appetite is evident in its numbers, as revenues have grown from Rs 2 crore in FY12 to Rs 31 crore in FY14. The past two years, according to Goyal, have been the most important phase in the growth of the company, when the &ldquo;real action&rdquo; took place. &ldquo;One of the bigger concerns for us was the shift of focus from domestic to international two years ago. Right now, less than one-third of our traffic and less than half of our revenue is from India. This changed what we were doing completely,&rdquo; he says. What prompted this shift? A failed vertical, says Goyal. When Zomato tried launching an event-ticketing business similar to that of Bookmyshow &mdash; but only for food events &mdash; it didn&rsquo;t work out. &ldquo;We realised that there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of money in events. So we had to shut down the events vertical and were left with a lot of good people in our team.&rdquo; And all this while, going international was at the back of their minds. Goyal saw this as a good way to utilise the team at hand and decided, &ldquo;<em>Dubai chalte hain aur launch karte hain</em> (Let&rsquo;s go to Dubai and launch it there).&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Little did the duo know its international network would become bigger than India. But the founders had done their homework before entering the Dubai market. Following that, Zomato entered markets such as the UK, New Zealand and Philippines. Supporting their overseas endeavours were Zomato&rsquo;s equally hungry investors.</p>\n<p class="p3">Goyal and Chaddah had started Zomato with an initial investment of Rs 40 lakh, pooled in from friends and relatives. In two years, the website succeeded in gaining some traction. In August 2010, it caught the attention of online recruitment portal Info Edge India, which owns portals such as Naukri, Jeevansathi, 99acres, among others. Info Edge initially invested $1 million but today is the majority stakeholder with an over 50% stake after infusing #143 crore spread over four rounds of funding. Last November, Zomato raised a total of Rs 228 crore ($37 million) from Sequoia Capital (Rs 171 crore) and Info Edge (Rs 57 crore).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;W<strong>hen In Rome,</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">With enough capital to fund its expansion, Zomato has been aggressively seeking out new markets overseas. However, venturing into foreign shores hasn&rsquo;t been a cakewalk. According to Chaddah, there are two major challenges &mdash; people and localisation. And only locals can best address localisation of the content and service in terms of culture, language and eating habits. &ldquo;We only launch a business in a country when we are sure we have a team that will own the business,&rdquo; says Chaddah. When Zomato steps into a new country, two senior representatives of the company travel to the place to organise a team that will handle local operations. Customisation comes not just in terms of local restaurants but with language as well. In Chile, Zomato&rsquo;s website can be accessed in Spanish. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t speak a word of Spanish and cannot even judge if the menus displayed are correct or not,&rdquo; jokes Goyal. The challenges don&rsquo;t end here. A number of overseas restaurants are more evolved and function very differently compared with India. &ldquo;In Prague, half the places have daily menus. So we have to update the menus on the website on a daily basis, as against India, where we update them only once in three months,&rdquo; says Chaddah. How does the site manage that? Merchants push for it more than them, he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="Zomato 3" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420537790.jpg" alt="Pankaj Chaddah" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We launch a business in a country only when we are sure we have a local team that will own the business" - Pankaj Chaddah, Co-founder, Zomato</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">As for competition in new markets, Zomato chose to bite the bullet. &ldquo;Different countries have different landscapes. In India, we don&rsquo;t see much competition. In New Zealand, when we faced competition from Menumania, we acquired the company.&rdquo; It also acquired online restaurant search service providers such as Czech Republic-based Lunchtime and Slovakia-based Obedovat for a total of $3.25 million in August 2014. It now faces competition only in the UK and Philippines markets. A pre-emptive acquisition seems like a good strategy given the adage: if you can&rsquo;t beat them, gobble them.</p>\n<p class="p3">For now, Zomato is entering markets where there are no clear market leaders. So, it has stayed away from big markets such as the US or Germany, where Yelp holds sway. But it chose to partner with Toptable, a restaurant booking site, in the UK. As part of the deal, Toptable will be Zomato&rsquo;s exclusive booking partner in the country. Users on Zomato&rsquo;s platform can check availability and make reservations at restaurants in London, Manchester and Birmingham. With overseas operations contributing 50% to revenue, Zomato is now looking at a higher share by entering new markets such as Canada, Ireland, Poland and countries in the Southeast and west Asia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Hot dish</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">For the just-concluded fiscal, Zomato clocked a 169% jump in revenues to Rs 31 crore but its operating losses more than quadrupled to Rs 41 crore for the year, thanks to aggressive expansion and acquisitions in new markets. The Sequoia deal values Info Edge&rsquo;s 50.1% stake in Zomato at Rs 494 crore against its original investment of Rs 143 crore. In other words, Zomato&rsquo;s overall valuation is now around Rs 1,000 crore ($158 million). Based on FY14 numbers, that is 32 times to sales, which is cheap by no means. But Goyal is unfazed by all this and believes investors know where their money is going. &ldquo;People who are putting in money are not stupid&hellip; they know their business.&rdquo; Goyal&rsquo;s confidence also stems from the unflinching faith that investors have put in him and in the business. Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director, Sequoia Capital India, at the time of investing in Zomato, had commented, &ldquo;Zomato is the first Indian consumer internet company to build a significant international footprint, and we have made this investment because of our strong conviction in the founders, the world-class product they&rsquo;ve built, and their ambitious global vision.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="Zomato 4" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420537899.jpg" alt="Hunger pangs" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">For now, Zomato is confident about its freemium model and does not intend to experiment with alternative sources of income. &ldquo;Globally, over 3,500 restaurants advertise on Zomato. Online advertising accounts for 100% of our revenue and we intend on continuing in the same vein,&rdquo; Goyal says, adding that he expects revenue from India to double from Rs 15 crore last year. What gives Goyal confidence is the fact that his site gets over 24 million visitors every month and has a bounce rate of around 24%. In internet parlance, bounce rate is the percentage of visitors who enter a site and &lsquo;bounce&rsquo; (leave the site) rather than viewing more pages within the site. A low bounce rate means visitors are spending more time on the site for information. For Goyal and team, that&rsquo;s a good enough reason to continue with their gastronomical pursuits.&nbsp;</p>', 'Flush with funds, homegrown restaurant delivery portal Zomato is on a buyout binge to whet diners'' appetite abroad', '9', '', 0, '', 'serving-it-hot-37', 32, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Serving it hot', 'Flush with funds, homegrown restaurant delivery portal Zomato is on a buyout binge to whet diners'' appetite abroad', '', '', '', 'Zomato,Foodpanda,restaurant discovery portal', 0, NULL, '2014-12-19 19:59:03', '2015-01-06 15:21:58', '2014-10-31', 0),
(38, 12, '', 'Making fun of English', '<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s noon in Velachery, a suburb in south Chennai. The otherwise silent std. III class at Bala Saravana Vidyalaya Matriculation School, suddenly comes to life as the students start singing their favourite rhymes, including one on mangoes, flowers and monkeys. It&rsquo;s not the usual recess break that has got the kids excited, but the fact that they are now going to be taught their English lessons, albeit with a difference. Making language fun for students to learn is a unique pedagogy offered by the Chennai-based Karadi Path Education Company. S Mangayarkarasi, the principal of the school, is very happy that she chose to go with Karadi three years ago. &ldquo;Most of my students don&rsquo;t have an English-speaking home environment. After participating in the Karadi Path programme, there has been a substantial improvement in such kids and they are much more confident when they speak in English now,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Karadi Path is the brainchild of CP Viswanath, who firmly believes that language can never be successfully taught in a classroom. &ldquo;It is the environment we are in that helps us pick up languages. Schools should create such an environment, where kids can pick up a language the same way they learn their mother tongue and not approach it as a subject,&rdquo; says the 52-year-old. Karadi Path is an offshoot of Karadi Tales, which was founded in 1996 and published children&rsquo;s books. It was sold in 2008 to ACK Media, which owns children&rsquo;s comic book titles Amar Chitra Katha and Tinkle. ACK Media became a subsidiary of Future Ventures in 2011 after the entity increased its stake from 26% to 56%. A year later, when venture capital fund Aavishkaar picked up a substantial stake in Karadi Path Education, it was spun off into a new entity, with Viswanath at the helm.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="Karadi 1" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420538122.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">Interestingly, the idea to launch Karadi Tales, represented by the quintessential story-telling bear, came about when Viswanath and his wife returned from the US in 1994 and couldn&rsquo;t find good books that their five-year-old could read. &ldquo;Indian books had a linear way of storytelling, focusing on the moral of the story. They did not get into details about characters and other nuances were missing,&rdquo; he says. So, along with his wife Shobha, Viswanath started to develop and sell audiobooks. &ldquo;Audiobooks are a powerful tool for language development. They offer a bridge between visual communication and the written word,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">The idea of Karadi Path struck the couple in 2000, when a clutch of NGOs in Dharavi, Mumbai and Kuppam in Andhra Pradesh, who were using Karadi Tales invited them to see how the kids were taking to the stories, making classes participative. &ldquo;In Dharavi, I saw kids talking in three languages but English was still a challenge for them. Language learning is easier outside the classroom,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">The company decided to explore why English language learning is difficult but picking up the mother tongue or languages spoken at home are much easier. It took the couple 10 years to develop a methodology, which deconstructed how the mother tongue is learned and reconstructed from that a process for intuitive and experimental language learning in classrooms. &ldquo;We must look at learning languages in a participative manner and not in a classroom. Language cannot be learned through instruction, word meanings and grammar. Unfortunately, that is the core of English instruction in schools,&rdquo; says Viswanath. &ldquo;Language learning must be 100% derivative; you grasp it from experiences and exposure in conversations. I may give you a lot of opportunities to guess what I am saying but never tell you what I am saying. Mothers use facial and voice expressions and hand gestures to communicate with a child,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Walking The talk</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Karadi Path offers three modules for students, depending on their skill levels. Magic English is a one-year English language programme for kids from std. II and above. Each session consists of three parts &mdash; action, music and story path &mdash; using actions, songs and stories to impart language skills over 84 sessions. The programme construct varies across international schools, English medium semi-urban schools and a government schools and depending up on the age group. Power English is a four-year programme from LKG to std. II, which develops and accelerates English proficiency over 72 sessions a year. Apart from these modules, the company trains teachers on delivering the material effectively. For Magic English, in the first year a school with 120 students in std. II pays Rs 60,000 and renewals are done around Rs 20,000-Rs 25,000 for each of the following years. The contract includes course material, training and CDs. &ldquo;The training includes three parts: a well-mapped process connecting the learning tools; CDs and books and experiential activities for intuitive learning; and implementation through the teacher who is continuously supported by Karadi Path,&rdquo; explains Viswanath. The average cost per child works out to around Rs 400 for Magic English and Rs 950 a year for Power English. In the three academic years since 2010, revenues have grown from Rs 13 lakh to Rs 2.5 crore in 2014. In the first six months of FY15, revenues for Karadi Path stood at Rs 2.9 crore.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420538177.jpg" alt="Karadi 2" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">Around 420 schools across Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Goa are using Karadi Path and the company is looking to increase its coverage to around 1,000 schools by the end of next year. And there is enough proof that it helps students get over the language barrier. Isha Outreach, the social development wing of Isha Foundation, used Karadi Path in their 31 adopted schools across Coimbatore, Salem and Dharmapuri in Tamil Nadu and found that the reading and comprehension ability of the around 5,400 students was twice as good after 48 Karadi Path Magic English sessions. The Goa government implemented the Karadi Path Magic English programme in 100 schools and found that comprehension and reading ability among 5,000 students improved by more than 50% and speech was three times better.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>The learning curve&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">In 2012, Karadi Path received its first round of funding of Rs 8 crore from social venture fund Aavishkaar. It is in the process of raising its second round of funding, around Rs 18 crore, by the end of the year to expand operations. &ldquo;Karadi Path meets the aspirational need for English education across India. Thanks to its product price, Karadi Path is able to reach children in smaller schools and at lower income levels,&rdquo; says Ajay Maniar, principal, Aavishkaar. He believes there is a global need for the product. &ldquo;The aspirational reasons for learning English are similar across countries and with some customisation, the product can definitely be launched overseas,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="Karadi 3" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420538213.jpg" alt="Ajay maniar" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Thanks to its product price, Karadi Path is able to reach children in smaller schools and at lower income levels" - Ajay Maniar, Principal, Aavishkaar</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In India, apart from schools, the company is also running a pilot programme &mdash; Magic English, an adult learner programme focused on comprehension and communication &mdash; in two colleges in Tamil Nadu and hopes to be available in 20-25 colleges by the end of next year. Since English is the medium of instruction for most educational institutes, a majority of students struggle to cope at college level, especially if they come from a vernacular medium. Even in English-medium schools, children have little exposure beyond what is taught to them in school, since back at home, most of their parents don&rsquo;t speak in English. &ldquo;We have created an artificial infrastructure, where all the higher education courses and the communication at workplaces is completely in English. There is a lack of empathy for students who come from a vernacular background,&rdquo; says Viswanath.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The company is working on a B2C or franchisee model, for which it is creating micro tutors. The Magic English Micro Tutor network was conceptualised keeping in mind rural schools that cannot afford English learning. The low-cost model encourages educated youth in remote villages to become entrepreneurs by becoming a micro tutor. The pilot centre running in Theni (Tamil Nadu) has 14 micro tutors who have to make an initial investment of Rs 20,000 for the learning kits and training. To get tutored, customers pay Rs 150 for a child below 14 years and Rs 300 for an adult for one level. The idea is to empower rural populations with better English learning at an affordable cost, besides allowing youth an opportunity to earn a decent income. The company is studying the programme delivery process to see how it reduces costs. Once this model is finalised, Karadi will launch it as a full-fledged product in the next 12 months. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Effective as the programme has been, there has been resistance at times from language teachers against changing the way they teach, but Viswanath says the results of the programme will speak for itself. &ldquo;We are trying to tell the world that the way they have been teaching English for years is all wrong. Changing the education system appears to be challenge but we are confident that the results will prove our methodology effective,&rdquo; he says. Karadi&rsquo;s investors, too, sound optimistic. &ldquo;We believe in what he [Viswanath] is doing and are willing to play for the long haul,&rdquo; adds Maniar. As for Viswanath, he believes Karadi Path will help students across various social backgrounds overcome the language barrier and provide them an even playing field and that for him is a bigger win.&nbsp;</p>', 'How Karadi Path is making it easier for students to learn the English language in classrooms through action, emotion and drama', '6', '', 0, '', 'making-fun-of-english-38', 33, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Making fun of English', 'How Karadi Path is making it easier for students to learn the English language in classrooms through action, emotion and drama', '', '', '', 'Karadi Path,English lessons,Aavishkaar,Magic English Micro Tutor', 0, NULL, '2014-12-19 20:07:38', '2015-01-06 15:28:18', '2014-10-31', 0),
(39, 2, '', 'Can Urzza quench Ramesh Chauhan''s thirst?', '<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s business as usual on a Wednesday morning in suburban Mumbai, with the Western Expressway highway choc-a-bloc with traffic. But, just off the highway, there seems to be an unusual buzz at Bisleri International&rsquo;s sprawling bottling plant. It&rsquo;s been around a month since the bottled water major launched its new energy drink, Urzza. And there clearly seems to be an overstated intent of making the launch highly visible. A printout of Urzza&rsquo;s sales pitch to retailers is glued right next to the security guard&rsquo;s cabin, even as employees sporting Urzza t-shirts zip past in a hurry. An army of delivery trucks plastered in the navy blue and golden colours of Urzza are lined up outside the main gate. For 75-year-old &lsquo;Cola King&rsquo; Ramesh Chauhan, the launch marks his comeback in the beverages business, one that he had exited in 1993, after selling the rights of marquee brands such as Thums-up, Limca, Gold Spot and Maaza to soft drinks giant Coca-Cola. But Chauhan, the indefatigable entrepreneur, proceeded to create an entirely new segment out of the only business that he was left with, even as everybody questioned the wisdom of selling water. Today, Bisleri is synonymous with bottled water in the country.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="Urzza###Can Urzza quench Ramesh Chauhan''s thirst" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420538613.jpg" alt="Urzza" width="850" height="580" />But from a monopolistic position, Bisleri has witnessed a steady erosion in market share in recent years. According to a Euromonitor report, Bisleri&rsquo;s market share by value in the off-trade (shops, supermarkets and <em>kirana</em> stores) bottled water market has declined from 39% in 2009 to 33% in 2013. Over the same period, PepsiCo&rsquo;s Aquafina has increased its share from 14% to 17%, while that of Kinley from Coca-Cola is up from 10% to 13%. Further, the low-margin nature of the bottled water business is also driving Chauhan to diversify into the energy drinks business that delivers much higher returns and provides some measure of cross-subsidisation. &ldquo;It is a simple calculation,&rdquo; says a long-time distributor of mineral water based in Mumbai. &ldquo;Currently, Bisleri is the only company in India that exclusively sells mineral water. Consider this: you pay only Rs 20 to buy a 1 litre bottle of Bisleri while you pay around Rs 40 for the same bottle of Coca-Cola. The input costs for both are roughly the same, you can add Rs 1-2 for Coca-Cola&rsquo;s costs to account for the additional flavor and soda, while the margins are more than double that for Coca-Cola. It is natural for a company such as Bisleri to diversify.&rdquo; Given Bisleri&rsquo;s slender profit margin of 3% in 2013 in the mineral water business, it becomes difficult to counter such unassailable logic.</p>\n<p class="p3">Hence, after a 22-year-long hiatus from carbonated beverages, Chauhan is focusing all his energies on Urzza, a non-caffeinated carbonated energy drink, priced at Rs 50 for a 250 ml can or a 300 ml PET bottle. With this, Chauhan is targeting a nascent segment &mdash; the fortified functional (FF) beverages segment that includes energy drinks, sports drinks and everything in between that is not a carbonated soft drink. Will Urzza then provide the fizz that Chauhan is looking for?</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Free-for-all</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The eleven-year-old Indian energy drinks market, valued at around Rs 800 crore and growing by 25% a year, is a drooling toddler about to get on its feet compared with the established carbonated drinks market, which is estimated to be around #20,000 crore. While the FF beverage market is more diversified in international markets such as the US, the UK and Japan, it is divided into two broad segments in India &mdash; energy drinks and sports drinks &mdash; which are dominated by Red Bull and Gatorade, respectively, and a smattering of smaller players such as&nbsp; Tzinga, promoted by Hector Beverages, and Cloud 9 by Goldwin Healthcare.</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420538667.jpg" alt="Urzza 2" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;&ldquo;There are no rules here. All the companies are working in an experimental mode to open up this market,&rdquo; says Ankur Bisen, senior vice-president, retail, Technopak. Take the case of Urzza: Bisleri is positioning it as a liquid charger &mdash; a product that can be had by anyone, anytime &mdash; for a quick infusion of energy. Its price tag of Rs 50 for a 250 ml can is at a premium to soft drinks but lesser than energy drinks such as Red Bull and Monster, which are priced at around Rs 100 for a 350 ml can.</p>\n<p class="p3">Chauhan claims he is trying to create an new category. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it to be branded as an energy drink. The energy drinks market is very small. We are aiming for bigger things. We want a product that tastes good, is refreshing and works as a pick-me-up. Urzza is not an energy drink but a power drink,&rdquo; he says. Chauhan claims he spent two years developing a taste that is &lsquo;interesting and intriguing&rsquo;. &ldquo;In India, drinking a soft drink is an experience, unlike in America, where it is looked upon as a washdown because their food is so dry. They&rsquo;re not conscious of brand or taste,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420538729.jpg" alt="Urzza 3" width="850" height="580" />In 2012, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) mandated that beverages such as Red Bull, Monster and Burn that contain more caffeine than the permissible limit of 145 parts per million should be named as caffeinated beverages. FSSAI also ordered these beverages to display statutory warnings that the products are not recommended for &ldquo;children, pregnant or lactating women, persons sensitive to caffeine and sportspersons&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">By excluding caffeine, Chauhan intends to target a wider base of customers including both &ldquo;children and grandmothers&rdquo;&nbsp;and integrate his product into the lifestyle of &ldquo;upwardly mobile&rdquo; consumers. &ldquo;Just like people have tea the first thing in the morning, we want this product to be consumed all the time. That&rsquo;s why we kept caffeine out since there are objections against it,&rdquo; says Chauhan. He says that he intends to conduct promotional campaigns in schools and colleges to promote daily consumption of Urzza. But, for now, Bisleri is targeting the upwardly mobile in the age bracket of 16-25 years through its marketing campaign.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">This sentiment is echoed by Mohit Ahuja, senior vice-president, Soho Square, which handles Urzza&rsquo;s ad campaign. &ldquo;We want to target consumers of both soft drinks and energy drinks. That is one of the reasons why we deviated from the norm and launched Urzza in PET bottles and cans. This gives us shelf placement near both soft drinks and energy drinks. We want to massify the energy drinks segment,&rdquo; he says. While the advertisements are targeted at young adults, the consumer target encompasses all age groups, clarifies Chauhan. He adds that the reason they&rsquo;ve also launched Urzza in a PET bottle is to facilitate mobility. &ldquo;The customer can just cap the bottle and take it away. Also, he can see the drink. We&rsquo;ve launched it in a can as well because the image of an energy drink requires us to sell it in a can. Otherwise, bottles are more functional,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Most energy drinks advertise that the consumer derives energy not from the calories contained in them but from a carefully concocted combination of caffeine, vitamins and herbs. Urzza carries no such disclaimer. &ldquo;The notion that energy is only derived from caffeine has been falsely perpetuated. Colas contain caffeine too. In reality, the key energy is derived from the sucrose. We have to change the way energy drinks are perceived,&rdquo; says Ahuja. Sharmila Sandeep, marketing head at Bisleri, says that caffeine is a stimulant and not a source of energy. &ldquo;As mentioned in the ingredients, our product contains vitamin groups B and C as well as tartaric acid, which aids in digestion,&rdquo; she says. Clearly, the fact that caffeine is equated with energy in the Indian consumer&rsquo;s mind is not lost on Bisleri.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420538767.jpg" alt="Urzza 3" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Our product contains vitamin groups B and C and tartaric acid, which aids in digestion as well" - Sharmila Sandeep, marketing head, Bisleri&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">However, Bisen feels that the energy drinks consumer is too young to make such mature choices and believes that Bisleri is not too late to the party. &ldquo;The market has only grown over the past two to three years. Right now, the reference point for any energy drinks consumer is Red Bull, which had a first-mover advantage. They think energy drinks are supposed to taste like that. But there are many people who have not tasted energy drinks yet,&rdquo; says Bisen. Bisleri can target this segment and achieve traction through a two-pronged strategy &mdash; a strong push along its well-established distribution network and an aggressive marketing campaign that emphasizes its key differentiator &mdash; an agreeable taste.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Push and pull</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Bisleri&rsquo;s formidable distribution clout, with 13 owned plants, 34 co-packers and 16 packers covering a retail base of around 5 lakh outlets, is a key advantage that the company has over its competitors. &ldquo;Wherever Bisleri goes, Urzza will follow,&rdquo; says Chauhan. This includes both off-trade outlets such as supermarkets and <em>kirana</em> stores as well as on-trade sales outlets such as restaurants, pubs and cafes. According to a Euromonitor report dated July 2013, 13% of all energy drinks sales in 2012 were through the on-trade segment.</p>\n<p class="p3">Bisleri has also launched a 360-degree marketing campaign encompassing all key mediums &mdash; TV, print, radio, digital and outdoor. The product is positioned as a premium drink for youngsters but Ahuja says they might target other age groups in future TVCs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420538884.jpg" alt="Urzza 4" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;We need to justify the price. That is where the taste and imagery comes in. We have chosen international locations and international models in order to create a premium image and buy into the aspirational zone,&rdquo; says Ahuja. &ldquo;Gold is a premium colour, which is why we decided to use it on the can,&rdquo; says Sandeep. But if taste is a key differentiator, why has Bisleri not advertised the same? Ahuja says that they haven&rsquo;t made taste the pivot of the TVCs, because taste needs to be discovered. &ldquo;However, in print and outdoor advertising, we have positioned it as an &lsquo;awesome-tasting&rsquo; drink,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Also, why the double z? Chauhan says he doesn&rsquo;t like four-letter words since most of them bring to mind swear words. He says that&rsquo;s the reason he added the double a in Maaza. &ldquo;Five-letter words are wholesome. Also, the pronunciation of the letter z varies within Indian languages. To make the pronunciation very clear to consumers, we made it a double z,&rdquo; says Chauhan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">When asked about why he chose a brand name derived from Hindi when his target consumers are yuppies, Chauhan retorts that people will soon forget it as a <em>desi</em> name after two to three months of advertising. &ldquo;Maaza, which also has a <em>desi</em> name, has done really well internationally in the European and American markets. Instead of the name, it is the image you create around it that matters. The important thing is that it should be simple, easy to remember and should sound good,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Numbers game</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Chauhan has invested Rs 100 crore in five manufacturing facilities of Urzza at Bengaluru, Rudrapur, Kolkata, Mumbai and Ludhiana. Four of these are new factories, while one Bisleri factory has been equipped to manufacture Urzza. The company will source from two third-party manufacturers based in Pune and Indore. He has put in a further Rs 100 crore for marketing. Chauhan says he entered the beverages market after realising that the buzz around the energy drinks market did not match up to the sales. He finds it to be a latent market, one that is both a challenge and an opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">However, Harminder Sahni of Wazir Advisors is quite intrigued. &ldquo;India is not a very fitness-oriented country and we are mostly water drinkers. In fact, the upwardly mobile segment is such that it needs to burn calories. I want to know what research companies do in order to arrive at the conclusion that the Indian market is ripe for energy drinks,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420538929.jpg" alt="Urzza 5" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"India is not a fitness-oriented country and Urzza''s target audience is the type that wants to burn calories" - Harminder Sahni, managing director, Wazir Advisors</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Chauhan reasons, &ldquo;Mostly, people go in for new products because existing products are not doing well. But Bisleri is growing at a good 25%. I could have let it continue. But Bisleri has a logistics problem. It is very heavy and it&rsquo;s costly to transport it to far-off places. With Urzza, the logistical expense will be lower since unit size is lower and revenue is much higher.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">With the cost of an Urzza can coming to Rs 6.25, and the estimated capital costs (electricity, land, machinery) for producing one can amounting to around Rs 10-12, the input cost of producing is not more than Rs 20-21, says another Bisleri distributor. Currently, Bisleri derives revenue of Rs 35 per Urzza can, excluding excise and sales tax, thus netting a cool Rs 12-15 per can of Urzza. The product is pushed to the retailer packaged as a six-pack at an average price of Rs 40, leaving him a neat #10 spread. Competitors such as Red Bull offer a 15-20% margin along with attractive package deals; Bisleri will need to match these levels. In comparison, with Ebitda margins hovering around 10% in the last three years, it can be estimated that a 1-litre bottle of Bisleri water sold to retailers at Rs 20 fetches the company around Rs 2 per bottle. Keeping these figures in mind, it is not difficult to guess why Chauhan is looking to diversify.</p>\n<p class="p3">Bisleri also may be suffering thanks to aggressive competition. A retailer based in Santa Cruz in suburban Mumbai says, &ldquo;During the summer season, my shop is filled with Aquafina bottles that Pepsi provides me free of cost along with bottles of Pepsi and Mirinda. I don&rsquo;t need to buy any Bisleri at all.&rdquo; However, Chauhan strongly denies any decline in market share. &ldquo;The data showed by Euromonitor only covers retailers. It doesn&rsquo;t include the direct distribution that Bisleri does to homes, corporates and the horeca (hotels, restaurants and canteens) segment,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420539041.jpg" alt="Urzza 6" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But what is very clear is that though revenue is growing 20% every year, with Rs 12 crore PAT on revenue of #373 crore, the water business is not impressive enough.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With a balance sheet size of Rs 142 crore in 2013, it is certainly bold on Chauhan&rsquo;s part to invest Rs 200 crore into Urzza. Chauhan aims to garner 10% of Bisleri&rsquo;s volume sales by the end of one year. &ldquo;We aim to sell 24 crore cans of Urzza within one year and garner around Rs 800 crore of revenue,&rdquo; says Chauhan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While it&rsquo;s too early to comment on the product&rsquo;s commercial success, the very fact that Urzza lacks a clear competitor, doesn&rsquo;t conveniently fit into any pre-existing product category and doesn&rsquo;t advertise its source of energy, might go against the beverage. &ldquo;Presently, market reviews are 50% good and 50% bad. The 50% bad reviews are because consumers are accustomed to the taste of Red Bull and Monster. It&rsquo;ll take time for Bisleri to make inroads,&rdquo; says a Mumbai-based retailer. However, another retailer says that customers have started asking for Urzza after the TVC has aired.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Chuahan, a brand veteran, is convinced that his product&rsquo;s taste and pricing will click with consumers. &ldquo;They have the money and they want something extra. Urzza is a premium luxury drink that fits the bill,&rdquo; he says. What about the other players who are targeting the same customer segment? &ldquo;We do not have any competitors,&rdquo; he reiterates. Only time will tell if this brand veteran, indeed, has got the Midas touch.</p>', 'How Bisleri is looking to create a whole new category in the beverages market with its non-caffeine energy drink', '14', '', 0, '', 'can-urzza-quench-ramesh-chauhans-thirst-39', 34, 1, 0, 0, 13, 'Can Urzza quench Ramesh Chauhan''s thirst?', 'How Bisleri is looking to create a whole new category in the beverages market with its non-caffeine energy drink', '', '', '', 'Bisleri,Urzza,Ramesh Chauhan,non-caffeine,energy drink', 0, NULL, '2014-12-19 20:30:07', '2015-03-16 10:55:53', '2014-10-31', 43);

(40, 16, '', 'A lot more to stuff in', '<p class="p1">"I travel 25 days a month. I don&rsquo;t think my wife really minds,&rdquo; says Ramesh Tainwala, sipping coffee at his spartan office in the Nashik district of Maharashtra. It&rsquo;s the 54-year-old Tainwala&rsquo;s second day at work after formally taking over as the global CEO of Samsonite International, the world&rsquo;s biggest luggage maker. Based out of Hong Kong, the jet-setting Tainwala&rsquo;s personal graph tells the amazing story of how a local vendor ended up heading the very MNC that was once his client. Tainwala, a postgraduate from BITS Pilani, began his career in 1981 with a plastic trading company. Five years later, he quit his job to start his own manufacturing unit that supplied plastic sheets to VIP Industries, which moulded them into suitcases. The turning point came in 1998, when Samsonite, after failing to woo VIP into a joint venture, entered into a partnership with Tainwala for his company to manufacture luggage for it in India. Two years later, after failing to making any big inroads into the domestic market, the US luggage major was all set to call it quits. That&rsquo;s when Tainwala made a bold move.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420539250.jpg" alt="Sam - 1" width="850" height="580" />Convinced that there was enough potential in the market, which was then ruled by VIP with over a 90% share, Tainwala got Samsonite to convert the agreement into a joint venture by giving him management control for two years and a 40% stake in the Indian operations. Samsonite took his word for it and has since been amply rewarded. Today, India is the luggage maker&rsquo;s fastest growing market after China and South Korea, fetching 6% of global revenue of $2 billion, while the Nashik unit, housed over 18 acres, is only the third manufacturing base outside of the US. As for VIP, the once undisputed king has now to contend with a competitor breathing down its neck. The turnaround in India&rsquo;s fortunes gave Tainwala a stature in the company&rsquo;s global pecking order. One elevation followed another before he took charge as the top boss. &ldquo;My mandate is to double our global business every five years. India&rsquo;s numbers will double every three years,&rdquo; quips Tainwala, even as an employee walks in with a box of sweets after the traditional Dussehra <em>puja</em>. This steely determination is also an outcome of how it all began for Samsonite in India.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Turning point</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Tainwala is very fond of the phrase turning point and to his mind, there are just two in the history of Samsonite in India. The company, which is called Samsonite South Asia here, was up against it from the time it started manufacturing in 1998, when its most formidable competitor, VIP Industries, was not giving away even an inch. &ldquo;There was very little we could do at the time and things were looking very grim,&rdquo; says Tainwala.</p>\n<p class="p3">That is an understatement given that the company&rsquo;s turnover was barely Rs 10 crore, with all of it coming from the Samsonite brand. &ldquo;Our cash flows were stressed and our global parent had to fund our salaries,&rdquo; he recalls. At that point, the factory had retrenched almost its entire workforce (200 of them) and was in the process of winding down its Indian operations. After making a foray into India and China in 1998, Samsonite was finally ready to bid goodbye to both markets. If there were no buyers for the Samsonite brand in India, the joint venture with the CP Group in China wasn&rsquo;t heading anywhere either. The silver lining, though, was that Samsonite&rsquo;s global bosses were fully convinced that exiting these markets was the right thing to do. So, when Tainwala made an offer that seemed workable, Samsonite stayed put.</p>\n<p class="p3">But the biggest change in the company&rsquo;s strategy came around 2002, incidentally thanks to an innocuous dinner conversation Tainwala had with a friend, whom he was meeting after years. &lsquo;You make washing machines, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; asked his friend, who, for some reason, had assumed that Tainwala worked for Samsung. The friend&rsquo;s reaction to being told that Tainwala, in fact, was working with Samsonite was even more startling. &ldquo;&lsquo;I did not know that the company sells locally&rsquo; was his reaction,&rdquo; recalls Tainwala.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420539314.jpg" alt="Sam 2" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">That observation proved to be a big insight for the-then COO of Samsonite India. &ldquo;Consumers knew the brand, so we just had to ensure that they could buy it. Till then, the Samsonite brand was available only with third- and fourth-grade retailers,&rdquo; he says. In fact, Tainwala claims that retailers were offered higher margins by competition for not selling his company&rsquo;s brand. &ldquo;Not surprising, then, that our brand was sold in just 40 retail outlets across six major cities in India,&rdquo; reminiscences Tainwala. That&rsquo;s when Samsonite took the crucial decision of opening company-owned stores. In mid-2002, two Samsonite stores were opened: one in Mumbai&rsquo;s suburb of Santa Cruz and the other in Dhanbad, in the newly carved out state of Jharkhand. Clearly, there was no sound marketing logic to the choice of the completely dissimilar locations. &ldquo;A friend had a store in Mumbai that he was looking to lease out. Since I hail from Dhanbad, someone was willing to give me a good deal on some space,&rdquo; says Tainwala with a smile.</p>\n<p class="p3">But the move paid off. Samsonite had never clocked business in excess of Rs 12 lakh per month across Mumbai before. &ldquo;The Santa Cruz store alone brought in Rs 6 lakh, while Dhanbad grossed Rs 2 lakh from zilch,&rdquo; says Tainwala with childlike enthusiasm. That was the cue the company was looking for and over the next one year, Samsonite opened 100 stores across 20 cities in India. By the end of 2004 (the company follows a December-ending financial year), Samsonite was a Rs 50-crore company in India and churning out a profit as well. &ldquo;It turned into a crown jewel in the global business. We had an operating profit margin of 15%, which is at 20% today,&rdquo; he explains. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Suddenly, a lot of things fell into place and things started looking better. According to Tainwala, it makes little sense to have a third party between the company and the consumer. &ldquo;Every retailer, be it Walmart or Macy&rsquo;s, believes that it is bigger than the brand it sells. That is never in the best interest of the brand,&rdquo; he quips. A big Bollywood fan, he draws a parallel from the entertainment industry to illustrate his point. &ldquo;Large producers like Yash Chopra and Karan Johar saw a big opportunity in distribution and opened offices across the world to capitalise on this. They got the best deals with exhibitors and ensured their brand made big money,&rdquo; says Tainwala. And that has definitely contributed to Samsonite&rsquo;s progress in India. Today, Samsonite&rsquo;s decision to go it alone in retail has given birth to a &lsquo;India business model&rsquo; within the company. &ldquo;We did exactly the same thing in both China and Brazil and we met with great success,&rdquo; says Tainwala, who is understandably proud. While the company got its distribution strategy right, the big boost in sales came when it launched American Tourister.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>The Yankee effect</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">When market research and business consultant IMRB presented its findings to the top management at Samsonite in India in 2006, there was good news and bad news for the company. In the premium segment, which was priced at over Rs 6,000, Samsonite held a 100% market share with its Oyster brand. The bad news was that the mid segment (starting at Rs 3,000) was dominated by VIP and this was the section showing accelerated growth. &ldquo;It was clear to us that we had to be in this segment if we wanted to go beyond being just a Rs 50-crore company,&rdquo; says Tainwala. VIP, by then, was a Rs 327-crore behemoth and practically accounted for the entire organised luggage industry in India, with Safari as a distant competitor at Rs 46 crore.</p>\n<p class="p3">Tainwala had a chat with Samsonite CEO Marcello Bottoli, who had joined the company in March 2004 after a stint with Louis Vuitton Malletier, and suggested that Samsonite sell luggage in a lower price band. &ldquo;I was uncomfortable with the idea since stretching a brand seemed very risky,&rdquo; recalls Tainwala. Given that a presence in this segment was mandatory, he quietly got two brand names &mdash; Atithi and Swagat &mdash; registered for the mid segment, only to realise at a later date that there was no need to take this step.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420539430.jpg" alt="Sam - 3" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">The reason? In 1993, Samsonite had globally acquired American Tourister, a brand that sold only in the US and in which the company had no actual interest. &ldquo;In the US, both the brands were in the same price band. Samsonite bought it to kill competition and buy market share,&rdquo; explains Tainwala. In India, Samsonite wanted to extend its price points and decided to reposition American Tourister as an affordable brand and launch it here. &ldquo;That was the second turning point in our history,&rdquo; he laughs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">American Tourister&rsquo;s 2007 launch was not without its share of challenges: Tainwala had to convince his bosses that the brand could make money in India without having to compromise on quality. The question was: how?&nbsp;The team in India spent a lot of time looking at VIP&rsquo;s products in this segment. &ldquo;The wheels and handles were not too great but the fact is that consumers never had a choice. This was the only brand they were aware of,&rdquo; he says. A little more probing and endless conversations with folks in the trade provided the answers to many questions. &ldquo;Consumers were looking for an alternative to VIP and that was the opportunity we had. However, we still had to figure out costs,&rdquo; recalls Tainwala. Research indicated that Indians wanted good wheels and sturdy handles. &ldquo;They did not care too much for pockets. It was clear our brand would be without bells and whistles,&rdquo; he says. By this time, duty structures had been rationalised and it made sense to import American Tourister from factories in China. Tainwala and his team first analysed Samsonite&rsquo;s handles, which, till then, were made of leather. &ldquo;We tried a PVC handle that worked. It was synthetic leather and was perfect for the Indian tropical climate.&rdquo; Then, the interiors were fine-tuned. The Samsonite traveller was an organised person, who liked slots for his shoes and shirts. &ldquo;In India, however, it was normal to pack one&rsquo;s shoes in a plastic cover. We also added a little stomach to the bag to give it an expanded look, which Indians love,&rdquo; he says. The objective was to knock off the frills and still have a product that looked great. In case of wheels, for instance, the team knocked off the decorative axle, without compromising on the product. &ldquo;We subjected the brand to relentless torture in our simulated environment in Nashik and it survived,&rdquo; he adds with a grin. The results were there for the world to see.</p>\n<p class="p3">More importantly, the market was slowly veering towards soft luggage, which worked to American Tourister&rsquo;s advantage. An industry veteran who has known Tainwala for many years credits him with spotting the change in trends from hard luggage to soft luggage. This coincided with air travel taking off in a big way. &ldquo;Soft luggage became a product of convenience that was light and looked good as well. This was the phase when consumer preferences were changing, supported by higher income levels, and Tainwala made the most of it,&rdquo; he explains. Concurring with his view is EP Suresh Menon, CEO, Samsonite South Asia. Pointing out that young consumers were quick to adopt colours such as orange and pale green, he says, &ldquo;Till then, black was the preferred colour of choice. Now, accounts for only 30% of American Tourister&rsquo;s sales.&rdquo; The changing trend was confirmed by the trade. Kanti K Rambhia, who runs 30 luggage retail outlets in Mumbai, says 80% of all luggage sold five years back was in black. &ldquo;Today, it is barely 30-35%, with consumers choosing fluorescent colours as well. There is a trend of people changing their luggage every year, compared with once every three years in the past,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420539485.jpg" alt="Sam 4" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">Tainwala derived these keen insights from observing the world around him. &ldquo;It was apparent that things were changing everywhere and even actors were performing in orange trousers. I just made note of such trends and put them into practise.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Equally important in the case of American Tourister was to get the communication right. The brief to TBWA, the advertising agency, was clear &mdash; to position the company as an international brand. &ldquo;VIP was known for its durability and we wanted to talk about our durability as well,&rdquo; says Tainwala. The TVC depicted a British tourist boarding a crowded local train in Mumbai while trying to keep his American Tourister suitcase safe. &ldquo;We consciously decided not to mention Samsonite anywhere and the strategy paid off,&rdquo; says Tainwala. According to Tainwala, the mention of the word American in the brand name worked and the brand was able to command a 10% premium over competition (around Rs 3,300, compared with Rs 3,000 for VIP), making it a cool product to use.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The net result: in 2008, on a turnover of Rs 200 crore, American Tourister brought in around #150 crore, with the Canteen Stores Department (CSD) accounting for half of the sales. Even today, American Tourister remains the top draw, accounting for 77% of Rs 647 crore sales clocked in CY13.</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>Catching competition unawares</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">It took a while for VIP to realise the changing undercurrent in the luggage market and it was not until 2010 that the company got its act together in the soft luggage segment. &ldquo;This was a new technology and they had to acquire the skills for it. In that sense, VIP lost some time,&rdquo; says the industry veteran. Barring Skybags, a soft luggage brand that accounted for barely 15% of its sales, VIP&rsquo;s portfolio predominantly comprised hard luggage. In 2010, VIP relaunched Skybag in the mass market segment and today the soft luggage brand accounts for 20% of its turnover.</p>\n<p class="p3">Even today, American Tourister, which sources 80% of its products from outside India, derives 85% of its business from the soft luggage segment. In case of Samsonite, this segment brings in 60% of revenues. On the distribution front, Samsonite retails at close to 2,500 outlets across India. VIP&rsquo;s brands sell in about 4,500 outlets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420539656.jpg" alt="Radhika  Parmar" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>" VIP has successfully maintained market leadership despite intense competition from international brands" - Radhika Piramal, managing director, VIP Industries</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">A debate over who the overall market leader is or, for that matter, who rules the mid-range market has been on for a while now. If Menon claims that his share of this segment is at least 50%, Radhika Piramal, managing director of the Rs 975-crore VIP Industries, is equally insistent that her company accounts for 70%. While Piramal agrees that the competitive landscape has changed dramatically in last 5-10 years, with international brands becoming more serious about the Indian market, she refutes losing ground to Samsonite. &ldquo;VIP has successfully maintained market leadership despite intense competition from international brands. The reason that consumers continue to prefer our brands is that we offer best-in-class quality, design and features within each price segment,&rdquo; elaborates Piramal. With American Tourister as its flagship brand, Samsonite&rsquo;s turnover has grown from Rs 243 crore in 2009 to Rs 647 crore in 2013. It has already clocked Rs 397 crore in the first half of 2014 and is on track to touch Rs 800 crore by the end of the year. Though Samsonite is growing comfortably, there is one piece of the entire luggage market that Tainwala is keen to possess but has been unsuccessful thus far.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Mass problem</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">While Samsonite has been able to retain its hold in the premium and mid-range luggage segments, it has been unable to crack the value segment &mdash; ranging below Rs 3000 &mdash; where VIP still calls the shots. Samsonite launched a new brand, AT, an abbreviated version of its more popular brand but the strategy backfired. According to Tainwala, AT was a new brand but consumers viewed it as American Tourister. &ldquo;Channel partners, too, were selling it as American Tourister. It was a big mistake,&rdquo; he explains. According to Menon, the problem with AT was that the brand did not meet consumers&rsquo; expectations on quality. &ldquo;There was only so much we could offer at Rs 2,000 and the consumer though he was buying a product similar to American Tourister. There was a clear mismatch,&rdquo; he elaborates.</p>\n<p class="p3">A presence in the mass segment is necessary for Samsonite to widen its product portfolio and accelerate growth in India. Consider this: the organised luggage market is only Rs 2,000 crore, while the unorganised market is ten times larger. &ldquo;We will need to take the tougher route of creating a new brand. That won&rsquo;t be easy but it needs to be done,&rdquo; says Tainwala, who estimates that it will cost at least Rs 20 crore each year for three years for the company to get there.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420539787.jpg" alt="Sam 6" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">Given how similar the markets are, Samsonite is planning to test the Korean and Chinese markets for low-priced luggage this Christmas. &ldquo;Even if it does not work, we will go back to the drawing board to correct it. According to my estimates, we will enter India with the new offering some time in 2016,&rdquo; he says. Incidentally, AT was also launched in China two years back and had met with the same fate.</p>\n<p class="p3">There is sound logic behind not introducing the new brand in India. &ldquo;We have a rule in the company about not taking up more than one new initiative every five years,&rdquo; says Tainwala. In India, the company has just launched High Sierra, a back-to-school backpack. The overall backpack business in the Indian market brings in 12% of revenue for Samsonite, while another 5% comes from accessories.</p>\n<p class="p3">The company globally acquired the High Sierra brand in July 2012 for $110 million. A couple of days later, Samsonite bought over Hartmann, a luxury luggage brand, for $35 million. &ldquo;High Sierra is a highly profitable brand post-acquisition and we have launched it in other markets as well,&rdquo; says Tainwala. In case of Hartmann, the plan is to grow slowly and start only a couple of stores. &ldquo;It is priced at over $500 in other parts of the world but the market is limited here,&rdquo; he explains. Other players in that segment include Tumi, Louis Vuitton and Rimowa. However, Samsonite does not see any immediate challenge to its hold on the top end of the market. The bigger plan is to give VIP a run for its money in the mid-range segment and, at the same time, figure out a way to make sense of the mass segment. But Tainwala will need to contend with a bigger market and the fact that, despite some similarities, customer preferences vary across these markets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Take High Sierra, for instance. Acquired two years ago, the brand was launched simultaneously in India, Germany, Korea and Scandinavia. In India, the brand took off in a big way, with customers loving the American look. In Germany, customers find the design clumsy and are questioning its functional value. In Korea, the brand has been a disaster because people want minimalist design, while the response has been lukewarm in Scandinavia. But Tainwala is up to the challenge. &ldquo;It is not easy to understand the mind of the consumer.

(43, 20, '', 'Junk food', '<p class="p1">For dedicated gourmands, too much of a flavour, cuisine or a mix of both can perhaps never be a bad thing. Which is why, in a perfect world, culinary concoctions such as dosa-flavoured pizzas &mdash; with Andhra-style chicken sprinkled on top for good measure &mdash; and vegetarian chettinad pizza would probably sell like &mdash; pardon the pun &mdash; hot cakes. Domino&rsquo;s recently introduced the aforementioned fusion pizzas in the south and items such as Taco Mexicana and the Junior Joy Box &mdash; a Rs 99-meal featuring a pizza slice, breadsticks, dessert and a toy that takes on McDonald&rsquo;s&rsquo; Happy Meal &mdash; in other markets. To top it all, the master franchise for Domino&rsquo;s Pizza and Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts in India, has introduced new &lsquo;pizza theatre&rsquo; concept stores, where customers get to see the making of pizzas.</p>\n<p class="p3">But for all its efforts Jubilant Foodworks is still&nbsp; feeling the heat, as a prolonged economic downturn results in even the die-hard loyal customers opting to eat at home. With rising food inflation and aggressive expansion, the company is facing intense pressure on margins and a falling return on equity.</p>\n<p class="p3">Jubilant&rsquo;s stock, however, continues to trade near its multi-year high of Rs 1,400, valuing the company at a whopping 67 times its last year&rsquo;s earnings and 14 times its book value. These soaring valuations don&rsquo;t seem to be reflecting the ground reality, which has worsened and is expected to stay that way for some more time. &ldquo;Owing to rising input costs, all the players in the industry &mdash; including us &mdash; had to raise prices by around 14%. Additionally, we also had to pass on to the customer the 5% service tax the government slapped on us last year. Coupled with rising inflation and, hence, less purchasing power, this meant that our customers shied away from eating out,&rdquo; says Ajay Kaul, CEO, Jubilant FoodWorks.</p>\n<p class="p3">Low economic growth has hit companies and customers alike; most importantly, the consumer&rsquo;s wallet has shrunk, compelling them to spend less on discretionary items such as pizza, which is understandable given that a pizza meal for two at a Domino&rsquo;s outlet today could cost you around Rs 800-1,000. To put things in perspective, Jubilant&rsquo;s same-store sales growth (sales from its existing stores) &mdash; a key indicator in the retail and food services market &mdash; has plummeted from a high of 27% in early 2013 to -2.4% in the first quarter of FY15, just a shade better than the -3.4% it registered in Q4FY14 (see: <em>No longer hungry</em>). To add to its problems, Jubilant has to pay higher wages, incur higher rent and deal with the skyrocketing prices of key raw materials, which adds up to 25% of its sales.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420540537.jpg" alt="jubilant1" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">To counter this, the company took two price hikes &mdash; a 3% increase in June and a 5% increase in November. But, in the face of flagging demand, there is little scope to raise prices further. That apart, Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts &mdash; the result of a franchise agreement between the Masssachusetts-based Dunkin&rsquo; Brands Group and Jubilant FoodWorks in 2011 with the intention of tapping into India&rsquo;s vast middle class market and a target of 500 stores in 15 years &mdash; is acting as a huge drag on Jubilant&rsquo;s margins and profitability and is Ebitda negative. Not surprising, then, that the company&rsquo;s operating margins have fallen by 400 bps from a peak of 19% in FY12 to 15% in FY14. This further hit its profits, which dipped to Rs 118 crore in FY14, as against #131 crore in FY13. Nothing much has changed since. In the first quarter of FY15, the company reported an 18.5% year-on-year decline in its profits to Rs 27.7 crore (see: <em>Leaving a bad taste</em>). What is even more striking is the fact that over the years, the company&rsquo;s return on equity has fallen from 42% in FY12 to the current 24%, which again is not a very encouraging sign from a valuations perspective.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">To be fair, Jubilant is not the only success story to have soured of late &mdash; its competitors, the Yum! Brands-owned Pizza Hut and McDonald&rsquo;s have also been feeling the heat, faring worse than Jubilant on every measure of growth. The Kentucky-based Yum! Brands has seen same-store sales growth fall from 5% in Q4FY12 to -3% in Q1FY13 and, except for a quarter of positive growth of 2% in Q2FY13, the figures have remained negative. And McDonald&rsquo;s&rsquo; same-store sales growth would test the conviction of even its die-hard supporters: in Q1FY14, same-store sales growth for the burger and fast food major fell from a high of 7.2% in the previous quarter to 0.5%, plummeting to -5.5% in the next quarter, before settling at -9% in Q1FY15.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Short-term pain</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">But, as they say, when the times get tough, the tough get going. Even as the Street worries about growth and return ratios, the company is busy rediscovering ways to become more efficient and is laying out strategies that will have far-reaching results in the event of a recovery. Despite the slowdown, the company continues to expand its store count from 465 in 2012 to the current 772 Domino&rsquo;s outlets across 154 cities, with an eye on a 1,016-store target for FY16. It also owns 34 Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts outlets across 34 cities and plans to add 25 more outlets by the end of FY15. The company&rsquo;s stated objective is to set up 150 Domino&rsquo;s outlets and 30 Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts stores annually.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In the short term, this could mean a drag on its financials but the company believes that as the economy recovers and demand kicks in, it will have a large base of stores that will effectively have a huge impact on earnings. Besides expansion, the other key decision by the Jubilant top management has been to invest in back-end and supply chain infrastructure. Four new commissaries &mdash; warehouses that provide the raw material used in pizzas, donuts and burgers &mdash; were commissioned in FY14 at Hyderabad, Guwahati, Nagpur and Greater Noida. All but the one at Greater Noida are operational and even this last commissary will be onstream by FY16. The company is also strengthening contracts and ties with cheese and milk suppliers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420540610.jpg" alt="Jubilant 2" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">To further control its costs, Jubilant has undertaken a four-pronged internal approach to reduce costs and improve efficiencies. Firstly, it started a scheme under which employees across the country sent in suggestions to reduce costs and improve productivity, with a separate team deciding upon the merits of the ideas and charting out their implementation. Secondly, it ingrained a six sigma practice across all functions and extended this to its business partners. Thirdly, it provided both top and bottom line incentives to store managers to reduce costs and improve efficiencies. Then, because of its hub-and-spoke model of commissaries, it buys all its requirements in bulk, giving the company a price advantage and ensuring that the ingredient quality is monitored at the vendor, commissary and store fronts. Though these steps may not have visible results in the short term, they will enable the company to spread its reach and improve same-store utilisations and realisations, while improving the economics of the stores and helping the company make higher return on its investments. &ldquo;We believe that the benefits of our portfolio revamp (the launch of 10 new pizzas and the Junior Joy Box) and store expansion will pay off once the recovery starts,&rdquo; says an analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher who is tracking the company.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Analysts feel that such moves have a two-fold effect. Some argue that the scorching pace of store expansion and the ensuing higher rentals and maintenance costs have played truant with Jubilant&rsquo;s margins. To be sure, the management is aware that the Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts expansion will be a drag on the company&rsquo;s overall margins by 150 basis points in FY15. But the consensus on the Street seems to be that by going in for store expansion, Jubilant is placing itself in an undefeatable position of strength, because when discretionary spending picks up, the new store roll-outs and the accompanying heavy promotional campaign will give the company good traction. Sunny Agrawal, analyst at Aditya Birla Money, sums up in a report: &ldquo;We believe that the strategy of JFW to expand aggressively during a downturn and spend money behind brand-building and back-end infrastructure is a step in the right direction. Moderation in same-store sales growth is a temporary blip and Jubilant has a very robust brand and business model, which has immense potential to tap the opportunity in the rapidly growing organised QSR industry.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420540652.jpg" alt="Jubilant 3" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">The QSR industry in India is estimated at Rs 13,000 crore as on 2013 and is expected to clock 20% CAGR over 2013-208. Jubilant currently has a 72% market share of the pizza home-delivery segment and 17% in the food services segment (Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts). So, even with increased competition, there is ample room for all players to grow. Offering an explanation about what went wrong with Jubilant and what is being done to remedy that, Kaul says, &ldquo;We conducted a survey to find out where we were lacking and found that the emotional connect with all our brands was strong and customers still gave all our products a thumbs-up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Long-term gains?</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Even though the company is doing everything that it can do to tide over the downturn and contain costs, a recovery in the economy and a revival in consumer spending will be crucial for some of these steps to really start contributing to growth. Says Jubilant&rsquo;s CFO Ravi S Gupta, &ldquo;There is a causality between GDP growth and discretionary spending; GDP is currently at 5% levels. Till 2011, unemployment was at 15% and we believe that it has come down further since then. Hence, because of a lack of spending power, discretionary spending has come down and affected our numbers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Just like others, the management too believes a cut in interest rates will spur growth and bring consumers back to pizzas. Not surprising, Jubilant is looking to open 150 new stores for Dominos every year. Gupta adds that most of Jubilant&rsquo;s stores are profitable in the first month of operations and all stores have a payback of less than three years. &ldquo;While rental costs have gone up, by opening more stores we are creating incremental profitability for our investors. As long as we can generate incremental return over the cost of the capital, we are doing fine.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Analysts also reckon that this is a short-term phenomenon and since the structural drivers of growth are in place, the company should do well in the long run. Manish Poddar, research analyst at Motilal Oswal, says, &ldquo;Aggressive expansion in the past three years is yet to bear fruit as revenue productivity of new stores is 30-40% lower than that of mature stores. But recovery in same-store sales can drive operating leverage.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420540682.jpg" alt="Jubilant 4" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">Seconds Pritesh Chheda, analyst at Emkay Global Financial services, &ldquo;There is a chance that with the base effect kicking in and inflation being somewhat controlled in relation to consumer income, same-store sales should revive in the third quarter of this financial year. By FY16, we should definitely see a sharp revival in same-store sales.&rdquo; He adds, &ldquo;This is a small, under-penetrated category. So it needs to grow at least at the FMCG growth rate of 15%, which is a bare minimum that the same-store sales growth should be at. The interim slowdown is the only problem for Jubilant. The franchisee is good, the business canvas is large, the company is aggressive and a huge opportunity exists.&rdquo; More importantly, Chheda believes that once growth kicks in, for every 1% increase in same-store sales growth, there will be a 3% increase in earnings. &ldquo;Based on operating cash flows of 3%, this growth should go up to 10%, with every possibility of touching 20%, which will lead to a 40% earnings upgrade. In that case, the stock will automatically become cheap,&rdquo; adds Chheda.</p>\n<p class="p3">Most analysts are betting on a revival to have a huge impact on earnings because of the base effect and Jubilant&rsquo;s growing size. This premise is also based on the assumption that its margins and return ratios, which are currently looking depressed, will start to look better, and that will help in justifying its valuations. However, that day is still quite far away. In the near term, since the stock is trading at a PE of 46 times its estimated FY15 earnings, there is a possibility of a correction. In other words, this stock is difficult to <br /> digest at the moment.&nbsp;</p>', 'Revamping its menu and aggressively opening new stores are now a staple feather of Jubilant FoodWork''s growth strategy.

(44, 20, '', 'Back from the brink', '<p class="p1">Borrowing from the future can be a tricky decision, especially when you have no way to tell which way the tide will turn. In the financial markets, debt financing is one such double-edged sword that can hit investors hard during downturns but can equally become beneficial during a recovery. Today, this sword has turned in favour of those who have attempted or managed to beat the debt trap. Though most companies are still struggling, some of them have been able to emerge out of the current crisis, partly thanks to asset monetisation, industry recovery and some key financial measures. So, what does this mean for investors? Well, if successful, some of these companies will actually be able to offer huge opportunities to investors, as lower debt and interest costs will not only have a positive rub-off on earnings but could also mean huge gains through valuations rerating. Currently, most such companies show depressed earnings because of the negative impact of leveraging in terms of interest costs, creating a vicious cycle where investors currently are afraid of taking a chance on the stocks given the amount of debt on the books, thereby impacting valuations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420541288.jpg" alt="Debt 1" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Most investors value these companies based solely on their enterprise value, which is a measure of debt plus equity. Reducing the debt or eliminating it altogether will be a good sign for equity shareholders as valuations will then start to tilt in their favour,&rdquo; says Saurabh Mukherjea of Ambit Capital. But emerging out of debt is not that simple, offers Nirmal Gangwal, founder and MD, Brescon Corporate Advisors. &ldquo;There are very few companies that have been able to come out of the debt trap. Those who have done well have managed to stay away from debt since, despite the concerns of the banking system. Though this could be a good sign for equity shareholders, they need to be vigilant while evaluating such turnaround cases and confirm whether the companies have a reasonably liquidity position. They also need to keep a close watch on the industry scenario and the business environment as these factors can sometimes drag companies back into debt. While poring over coverage ratios and cash flows, investors also need to check how sustainable the company&rsquo;s ability to service debt is.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While there is a need for caution, following are four companies that have been able to improve their performance and emerge out of debt, thereby giving their shareholders an edge over their borrowers.</p>\n<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Aban: Slick affair</strong></span></p>\n<p class="p1">Just managing its debt would not have helped India&rsquo;s largest offshore service provider Aban Offshore. Instead, a timely recovery in business and the industry helped matters. A revival in demand, better realisations and its efforts to cut debt have now started showing results. Aban&rsquo;s ratio of debt to equity soared to 6.30 times in recent times, before falling to 3.8 times by the end of March 2014. Importantly, Aban&rsquo;s ability to service debt has improved, with its interest coverage ratio improving to 1.5 times in FY14 from 1.3 times the year before. That apart, it has refinanced its debt for a longer tenure of 15 years, which helped in lowering the pressure on its annual bullet payments at a time when liquidity was a huge issue. Thankfully, a longer payment cycle and improving cash flows from operations &mdash; Rs 258 crore in FY12 to Rs 423 crore in FY14 &mdash; are helping the company tide over the crisis. Converting all its loans into dollar denomination also helped Aban in lowering interest rates, thus protecting its loan exposure from currency volatility and serving as a natural hedge. &ldquo;FY14 was a decisive year for us, with the company reflecting a significant improvement in its performance, both physically and financially. This performance has also signaled that the company has overcome a sectoral hump and is poised for better days. Aban has successfully deployed almost all its rigs on contract, resulting in high asset utilisation,&rdquo; said managing director Reji Abraham.</p>\n<p class="p1"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420541421.jpg" alt="Aban " width="850" height="580" />Aban has 18 rigs in its portfolio, which are deployed around the world and in the domestic market for companies such as ONGC. After the 2008 crisis and fall in crude oil prices, the global demand for rigs had shrunk and day rates &mdash; or rentals &mdash; had tumbled. However, from lows of about $90,000 a day, the rates have recovered to over $124,000 a day. Asset utilisation levels has improved over the past three years, helping Aban enjoy economies of scale. Aban&rsquo;s operating profit margin has improved from 55% in FY13 to 57% in FY14 and 59% in the June quarter of FY15. So far, the going has been good for Aban, but for the company to emerge out of the debt trap, the industry environment must improve, as a large number of its offshore assets will come up for renewal in 2015 and 2016. &ldquo;In the future, the company expects to report an increase in earnings, which are not driven as much by an increase in day rates as by a decline in interest,&rdquo; sums up Abraham.</p>\n<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Gati: On a roll</strong></span></p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;Leading logistics services provider Gati&rsquo;s prospects have taken a hit due to the #450 crore debt on its books. Though the company&rsquo;s sales grew at 13% over the past four years, its debt was 1.7 times its equity capital. Gati&rsquo;s ability to service debt, particularly in the light of non-core businesses being under pressure, also came under question.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420541472.jpg" alt="Gati" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;However, things are changing for the better. Recently Gati has hived off its highly capital-intensive shipping business &mdash; which was going through a downturn and making losses &mdash; while divesting a 40% stake in a separate subsidiary. Gati transferred its express distribution and supply-chain business into a joint venture with Japanese firm Kintetsu World Express, which bought a 30% stake for Rs 268 crore. Due to these initiatives Gati not only retained control over its working capital but also managed its debt and liquidity position. This would improve even more as Gati reduces its debt while diluting a bigger stake in the shipping business. &ldquo;Our FCCB will be repaid through the sale of large land parcels which we will initiate when we get better prices,&rdquo; says Sanjeev Jain, director, finance, Gati.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;Gati now wants to focus more on growing businesses such as e-commerce, express cargo and cold chain logistics. These businesses fetch higher margins, which are critical for its profitability and earning in the future.</p>\n<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Jain Irrigation: A bumper harvest</strong></span></p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;Jain Irrigation, the largest player in the micro irrigation space, has been able to cope with its debt problem as its efforts to reduce dependence on working capital and manage receivable days have started yielding results. In the past, the company had accumulated a huge amount of debt because of delays in the payment of government subsidies on the micro irrigation systems (MIS) solutions that it supplies to farmers, which led to an increase in receivables. The MIS business gross receivables have come down from 369 days in FY11 to 257 days in FY14 and further to 235 days in the June 2014 quarter. A large part of this change could be attributed to a change in business model, as the company now follows a cash-and-carry model, whose benefits are yet to fully reflect on its books. In a note prepared for Axis Capital, analyst Hemant Patel says, &ldquo;The management is targeting a further 45-day reduction in receivables in FY15, as the full benefits of the cash-and-carry model play out. We expect working capital-to-sales to decline to 39% in FY16 from 61% in FY13 and 50% in FY14.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420541502.jpg" alt="Jain 1" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"We have mintaned strict control on inventory and capex to help us manage debt effectively" - Anil Jain, managing director, Jain Irrigation</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">&ldquo;We have shifted to a cash-and-carry model, where the subsidy part is now taken care of by farmers itself, which is why our concern over receivables is now easing. Our gross receivables have fallen from Rs 2,500 crore in FY12 to Rs 1,600 crore currently, despite growth in revenues. Additionally, we have maintained strict control on inventory and capex, which has helped us manage our debt effectively,&rdquo; said Anil Jain, managing director, Jain Irrigation. Moreover, a reduction in receivables has resulted in higher cash at the company&rsquo;s disposal (about Rs 800 crore-900 crore), which it is now using to fund its business growth, instead of just relying on borrowed funds. Case in point: in FY14, the company generated about Rs 930 crore from operations, as against Rs 346 crore in FY13.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420541595.jpg" alt="Jain 2" width="850" height="580" />Its core MIS business &mdash; where Jain Irrigation is the largest player with a 55% market share &mdash; has been growing at a rapid pace due to low penetration and the government&rsquo;s emphasis on micro irrigation. As the company is now able to fund its growth from the internal accruals, the management believes that they now have the opportunity to grow much bigger. Higher growth will have a huge impact on the company&rsquo;s earnings, which are currently depressed because of interest costs. Incremental growth in revenue will reflect directly on earnings. For instance, as against an EPS of Rs 1.4 in FY14, the company is expected to report an EPS of Rs 6 in FY15 and Rs 11 in FY16. More importantly, due to the improvement in earnings, return ratios such as return on equity are expected to improve. This will be a key catalyst for Jain Irrigation&rsquo;s share prices as the market tends to give a higher valuation premium for companies that show better return ratios and manageable debt.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Ceat: Clocking a good mile</strong></span></p>\n<p class="p1">Ceat, the leading player in the domestic tyre industry, has managed to ease investor concerns over its rising debt. &ldquo;Around 2011-2012, we were hit hard because of the sudden jump in raw material (rubber) prices from Rs 80/kg to Rs 140/kg. We had also incurred a large capex for our manufacturing unit in Gujarat, where the benefits of production ramp-up were yet to be seen. Thankfully, raw material prices have come down, production has ramped up and due to our focus on a profitable product mix, we have been able to generate good cash flows and earnings,&rdquo; says Anant Goenka, managing director, Ceat.</p>\n<p class="p1"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420541642.jpg" alt="Ceat 1" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Rise in production and a profitable product mix have ensured good cash flows"- Anant Goenka, managing director, Ceat</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">A changing business mix, focus on exports and improvement in margins has led to better days for the tyre major. &ldquo;Since FY10, Ceat has significantly increased its focus on high-margin segments (two-wheelers, passenger vehicles, specialty tyres) and has gained market share in the domestic two-wheeler and utility vehicles segments (up from 8% and 0% to 22% and 14%, respectively, in the past three years), even as domestic auto demand struggled. Increasing exposure in these segments helped revenue (18% annual growth) and operating performance (21% annual growth in Ebitda) over FY10-14. We expect the trends to continue as Ceat transforms itself into a more focused, profitable entity,&rdquo; says analyst Ambrish Mishra, who tracks the company at JM Financial Institutional Securities, in a research note.</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420541733.jpg" alt="Ceat 2" width="850" height="580" />A better revenue mix and margins are now helping the company generate higher cash flows &mdash; annual cash from operations has improved from a mere Rs 6.7 crore in FY12 to Rs 557 crore in FY13 and Rs 155 crore in FY14 &mdash; and improved its liquidity and ability to service debt. &ldquo;Metrics have continued to improve on the debt side. Our overall short- and long-term debt equity stands at 1.1, as against 1.3 in the previous year, despite the increased operations and working capital requirements. Our interest to Ebitda ratio is also four times and our debt service coverage ratio is more than two times,&rdquo; company spokespersons said during a recent analyst conference call. Worries on the debt front are easing at a time when the business outlook is improving, given the increased focus on exports and high-margin businesses. The company has a 40% market share in Sri Lanka, which it further intends to replicate in countries such as Bangladesh. For instance, the contribution of non-truck revenues has risen from about 40% in 2011 to 52% in FY14, which is helping net higher margins and earnings. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>', 'A handful of companies have managed to overcome their leverage blues.

(47, 24, '', 'Watches whose time has come', '<p class="p1">If, like me, you think a watch is a watch, the only differentiator being its face, strap and the number of diamonds on the bezel, you&rsquo;re in danger of being laughed off the planet. There was a time when I thought &mdash; not unlike millions of others &mdash; that the era of the watch was well and truly over. You could hardly move without the time of day being beamed to you &mdash; on your mobile phone, the car dashboard, your laptop, heck, even on security cameras and toll booths. What is the point of a watch now?</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;Not only has the watch survived, it remains an essential part of a well-groomed person&rsquo;s wardrobe &mdash; a piece of jewellery if you will &mdash; the absence of which is likely to draw unfair comments in tony society, the same way as if you went to a celebrity event in high-street fashion instead of regulation couture. True, watches may no longer be necessary for telling the time, but wearing one is as indispensable as a smart pair of shoes or a designer jacket. No wonder then, that magazines and newspapers are awash with advertising for watches and brands compete fiercely for this segment of the luxury market.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;And now, on October 31, 72 watches with names from the houses of Harry Winston, Breguet, Chanel, Chopard, Hublot, Blancpain, Omega, Louis Vuitton, Herm&egrave;s, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, among others, will compete for top honours in the horology world under different categories of the Grand Prix d&rsquo;Horlogerie de Gen&egrave;ve. Each of these watches has been specially created to vie for the top place at this prestigious event &mdash; the Oscars of the watch world, if you will &mdash; and intense speculation about technological advancement, aesthetic appeal and luxury potential have gone into the making of this selection.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;For the first time this year, these competing watches were unveiled in India as part of a promotional tour that saw Indian guests at the Swiss ambassador&rsquo;s residence take a peek at brands that have still to mark their entry into India &mdash; Delaneau, Urwerk, Gr&ouml;nefeld Parallax and Frederic Jouvenot. If you&rsquo;re attracted to watch stores at duty-free shops at international airports, you&rsquo;ll know the feeling this small mechanical device ignites &mdash; a rush of adrenaline that results from design, precision and a hoary history and lineage.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;What was exciting about these watches was that they are billed to be among the most desirable in the world, whether or not they walk off with the awards. And what it emphasises is the growing importance of luxury watches in a country where consumption is still at a take-off stage. While luxury watches do have a presence in India, their popularity has not percolated down to the popular masstige level and is still restricted to the top of the pyramid. It is perhaps in anticipation of these <em>acche din</em> that Yashovardhan Saboo, chairman of Ethos, the 45-store strong watch company, initiated the event in India with its Swiss promoters. &ldquo;The Indian&nbsp; watch market is evolving and developing fast. As our growth accelerates, we expect a large uptide in the market for fine watches too,&rdquo; says Saboo.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;The 72 finalists will soon know which way the jury has swung. Jury President Aurel Bacs, advisor to private collectors and museums on high-end watches, was auctioneer at Christie&rsquo;s'' watch department for over 20 years and is responsible for some of its more enviable records over a period that saw sales move from $8 million to $130 million. Some of that knowledge will come in handy, because, as Saboo said of the represented watches displayed in New Delhi, &ldquo;These watches are not symbols of luxury, they are symbols of excellence and creativity of the art of horology, just like fine paintings, sculptures or architecture.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;What makes Grand Prix d&rsquo;Horlogerie de Gen&egrave;ve important is its genesis. Established as recently as 2011 to promote Swiss watchmaking and its values, it is represented by the republic and canton of Geneva, the city of Geneva and the Geneva Laboratory of Horology and Microengineering (Timelab). Like Swiss cheeses and Swiss chocolates, Swiss watches occupy our mindspace &mdash; and it isn&rsquo;t just brands and prices that set them apart, but also a tradition for excellence and innovation. Perhaps the real reason we sport watches on our wrists, whether we tell the time or not.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>&mdash;The author is a Delhi-based </strong><br /><strong> writer and curator</strong></p>', 'Seventy-two Swiss watches in the running for top honours in Geneva are now in India.

The free-flowing style in which it is written with anecdotes covering all major religions and faiths, which makes this book a comprehensive read. Here&rsquo;s an advertising professional who looks at things from an Indian perspective and has been able to focus the spotlight on the changing Indian consumer and his/her values, beliefs and participation in religious rites and rituals.</p>\n<p class="p3">Be it auspicious or suspicious occasions, be it a chronicle of ages or marriages, be it weddings or festivals, religious travel or tourism, Parameswaran has brought in a different perspective to the Indian way of living.</p>\n<p class="p3">It is interesting to observe how a religious ritual such as <em>puja</em>, has evolved over the years, with dire predictions being made about the future course of things to come. This is evident in the following excerpt from the book: &ldquo;Many years ago, the only way to perform an elaborate <em>puja</em> was to invite a scholarly <em>purohit</em>/<em>brahmin</em> to come and perform it for you at your house. Then came books that gave you step-by-step instructions. Now we have video CDs that can show you what needs to be done. Soon, there will be smartphone apps to tell you the same. In the future, I suspect we could even have a <em>purohit</em> do a <em>puja</em> over video via Skype. In the bigger cities of India, it would save the <em>purohit</em> a great deal of time. And a <em>purohit</em> sitting in Mumbai could well guide the devotee in New Jersey.&rdquo; Times change, people change and even methods change. But, in my opinion, the <em>puja</em> remains the same.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-06/1420542390.jpg" alt="Book review" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">In another section of the book, it is also interesting to note how occasions such as weddings have begun to be described by their market size and all the other economics associated with weddings.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;A report in the <em>Hindustan Times</em> (April 1, 2013) pegs the size of the wedding industry as Rs 1.5 lakh crore. Given the size of India&rsquo;s grey economy, the real figure could far exceed any official estimate. Expenditure on weddings encompasses attire, jewellery, wedding events (<em>puja</em>, cuisine, decoration, entertainment, etc.) as well as travel, hotels, transport and other associated costs (not to mention the products bought as wedding gifts which could include cars, homes and consumer durables). The report indicates that 10% of Indian weddings are planned to accommodate over a thousand guests!&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;This reflects on how our nation spends lavishly on weddings and related celebrations. Parameswaran, with his experience and easy writing style, connects with the reader and gets him/her involved in the anecdotes and experiences mentioned in the book.

(51, 12, '', 'Go carting online', '<p class="p1">&nbsp;If there is one business that is crying out loud for disruption, it is the groceries segment. Let&rsquo;s face it, the process of buying groceries involves multiple pain points at present &mdash; right from finding a parking spot, to jostling with other customers in the aisles as you shop, to waiting in a queue where time stands still as the new trainee tries to figure out the barcodes for billing. A very simple business proposition that could help you take care of this cumbersome ordeal would be to take this process online. For businesses, it would be like hitting the jackpot, as most households spend a chunk of their money buying a predictable set of products week after week, no matter which way the economy is heading. And yet, the online grocery business has been a tough nut to crack across the globe, barring a few success stories such as Ocado (UK), Yihaodian (China) and FreshDirect (US). Even Amazon, which recognises groceries as the last piece of a puzzle that it has to solve before it can rule the online world, has taken it slow on this front, expanding into San Francisco and Los Angeles just last year after delivering groceries in and around Seattle for five years. While that list will soon expand to include many more cities across the US and the world, it will be some time before Amazon is able to put together the very last piece of the puzzle.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p1"><img style="vertical-align: top;" title="garphic 1" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421218294.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="580" />In India, though, the concept of e-groceries is slowly starting to capture the public&rsquo;s imagination much faster, with companies receiving $80 million-90 million seed funding in the past three to four years. Still a very small part of the retail pie collectively making roughly Rs 400-450 crore in turnover, this bunch is growing at a pace of 20-25% on a month-on-month basis. The potential &mdash; in terms of market size &mdash; is huge: the Indian retail market is pegged at around Rs 304,200 crore, with 92% still falling under the unorganised sector. While groceries make up 60% of the total pie, most of the market is still addressed by <em>kirana</em> stores. &ldquo;India has low supermarket penetration &mdash; 90-95% of consumers are serviced by <em>kirana</em> stores. (<em>see: Biggest slice of the pie</em>) This leaves room for e-grocery players to come in and disrupt the market,&rdquo; says Abhishek Shah, vice-president, Unilazer Ventures, which has invested in Mumbai-based online grocery Ekstop. &ldquo;This category has the largest repeat consumption basket of the urban Indian consumer &mdash; and almost all of it can be serviced through online e-commerce. &nbsp;We are a home delivery and service-obsessed country,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Early failures</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Serial entrepreneur and investor K Ganesh strongly believes in the potential of the online grocery business. In the past, Ganesh has spotted opportunities in the BPO, analytics and online tutoring sectors ahead of the market and built successful businesses. After selling his last business &mdash; which involved online tutoring &mdash; to Pearson, Ganesh was looking for businesses that would leverage technology and the internet to solve existing pain points, and groceries were the first to catch his eye. But when he tossed the idea around with a couple of venture capitalists, there was hardly any interest. &ldquo;They would quote Webvan as a case study for why online groceries won&rsquo;t work or would say there are no margins in bread and eggs. It was clear that nobody had a clue about the business,&rdquo; says Ganesh, who then went on to incubate Bengaluru-based online store BigBasket, the largest player in this space. Webvan was an online grocery in the US that declared bankruptcy in 2001, three years after its launch but not before blowing up $800 million in venture capital and IPO proceeds by expanding too fast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Ganesh knew that with the right team, the online groceries business could definitely be a winner and that Bengaluru had a ready talent pool. It was here that VS Sudhakar, Hari Menon,&nbsp;Vipul Parekh&nbsp;and VS Ramesh launched an e-commerce portal called Fabmart in 1999, much before e-commerce became a buzzword. The site sold everything from books and music to even groceries. However, given the slow bandwidth speeds and low penetration of the internet at the time, the venture didn&rsquo;t really take off. In 2003, it was rebranded as Fabmall and launched as an offline grocery store, subsequently merged itself into Hyderabad-based retail chain Trinethra. It was acquired by the Aditya Birla Group and rebranded as More in 2007; the online arm was merged with Indiaplaza. Fabmart was one of the first customers at Ganesh&rsquo;s BPO venture. After selling off its offline grocery venture to Aditya Birla, the Fabmart team had moved on to different roles when Ganesh got them thinking about an e-grocery business. This was when Abhinay Choudhari, who was running an e-grocery portal called Shopasyoulike at the time, joined the team and they launched BigBasket in December 2011 in Bengaluru. In the next three months, BigBasket raised $10 million from private equity firm Ascent Capital, which helped it scale the business. Demand has been growing at a blistering 15-20% on a monthly basis, with the company extending services to Hyderabad and Mumbai in 2012. Its 600-strong team services around 5000 orders across all locations, with the average ticket size being #1,500 per basket.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421218424.jpg" alt="BigBasket" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>All eggs in one BigBasket: (L-R) Vipul parekh, Hari Menon, VS Ramesh, VS Sudhakar and Abhinay Choudhari&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">When it started operations, BigBasket adopted a just-in-time strategy for inventory management, sourcing the bulk of its requirements from Metro Cash &amp; Carry and other smaller vendors. But as the business scaled and it started to offer same-day delivery in February 2013, the company buys products from FMCG manufacturers, farmers and mills and stocks them in its warehouses in Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Mumbai. In Bengaluru, it follows a hub-and-spoke model, where goods are sent to hubs and picked up by vans for delivery. In other cities, since the customers are not as spread out as they are in Bengaluru, the company delivers straight from its warehouse. The model seems to have paid off; In FY15, BigBasket hopes to clock more than Rs 200 crore growing on 15-25% on a month-on-month hopes to touch Rs 3000 crore in 2018 driven by its expansion plans. &ldquo;We expect Bengaluru to break even by the end of this year at the operations level. We should be able to break even in every city we enter in two to three years as operations mature,&rdquo; says Parekh, now CFO, BigBasket.</p>\n<p class="p3">Plans are in the works to expand the business to six more cities in the next two years. &ldquo;We plan to enter Delhi NCR and Pune by the end of 2013,&rdquo; says Sudhakar. Chennai, Chandigarh and Ahmedabad are on the cards for 2015. The company has just raised Rs 200 crore in its next round of funding led by Helion Advisors, Zodius Capital including existing investors Ascent Capital and LionRock Capital. &ldquo;This business is all about scale and quite capital intensive. It is only when you reach a certain level that FMCG majors see some value in engaging with you,&rdquo; says Ramesh. And scaling up takes time &mdash; the customer clicking the &lsquo;place order&rsquo; button is the only easy thing about this business. Unlike e-commerce, where you can sell anything from a book to a TV to pet food and service the entire country with a few centralised warehouses, here, you need to build presence ground-up, one city at a time. &ldquo;It is a modular business that can be replicated in different cities but we have to scale up one city at a time. We can&rsquo;t do a pan-India launch like other e-commerce players,&rdquo; says Menon, CEO, BigBasket.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Delivering comfort</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Managing logistics in an online business can be challenging; add same-day delivery and perishables to the list and it could be a recipe for disaster, if not executed well. So, e-grocers rely on technology to manage both logistics and inventory. BigBasket, for instance, has all its delivery vans fitted with GPS, which provides optimal routes for its deliveries and helps the company track the vehicles. The drivers get handheld devices with built-in apps to show different payment modes and the time taken to reach the destination. &ldquo;Companies need to know how to leverage technology and improve efficiencies and customer experience using analytics, apps and software, apart from having a good understanding of how the retail supply chain and distribution works,&rdquo; says Ganesh. BigBasket&rsquo;s customised inventory management software takes into consideration customer buying behaviour, the ability of its supplier to match demand and the seasonality of the product before deciding on the minimum inventory required. Thanks to its accuracy, the company needs to stock inventory only for 10 days, much lower than the levels maintained by offline stores. According to Pragya Singh, associate vice president, Technopak, offline stores on an average stock up to 15-25 days of inventory. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Mumbai-based online grocer Ekstop also uses technology to not only manage inventory but also analyse product-by-product sales on a daily basis and decide whether to continue stocking that product. For CEO Sumat Chopra, the seeds for Ekstop were sown as a student at Carnegie Mellon and Harvard. Chopra discovered that stores closer to the campus were almost twice as expensive compared with the rest of the Walmarts and Costcos in town. &ldquo;With shops close to the campus proving to be expensive, it was a nightmare for most students to go grocery shopping after finishing their studies and projects. It was then that I realised that the pain points of grocery shopping in the US were similar to those in India,&rdquo; he says. So Chopra set up a website where students could place orders, and partnered with Walmart and Costco to deliver the goods on a weekly basis. After a five-year stint in the corporate world, Chopra decided to return to India around 2010, eager to start a venture. On realising that he would be better prepared with an MBA, Chopra proceeded to join INSEAD, meeting Ekstop co-founder Shaurya Mehta there. Soon, the duo managed to raise angel round funding of $200,000 to power their idea, which crystallised into the launch of Ekstop in May 2012. The e-grocer is planning to extend its services from the current Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai to Panvel and Pune by the end of 2013. &ldquo;The grocery market in Mumbai alone is worth Rs 3,042 crore, and if organised retail makes up 5%, there is significant headroom for all players to grow,&rdquo; says Chopra.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421218631.jpg" alt="EkStop" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>One-stop shop: Shaurya Mehta (L) and Sumat Chopra of Ekstop</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Funds have been quick to spot the growth: Unilazer Ventures took a 25% stake in the company earlier this year for an undisclosed amount. Ekstop handles up to 800 orders a day, going up to 1,000 orders during peak times. It currently deals in about 10,000 products and even offers same-day delivery.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Cashing in</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Ekstop is not the only one to try this gimmick: online grocers often use two-hour windows throughout the day (across six slots) when the customer can choose for the products to be delivered the same day. The companies need to operate with precision as most of the orders contain perishables and taking goods back is never a good option. They also have to ensure that the customer experience and the quality of the products remain consistent during every single delivery. For instance, if the customer orders groceries three to four times a month on an average, compared with just one or two orders on other e-commerce sites, just one bad experience could turn the customer off forever. That&rsquo;s why almost every online grocer has a no-questions-asked return policy. Also, unlike in general e-commerce orders for merchandise such as books or electronics items, where the shopping cart contains a limited number of items, grocery orders contain at least up to 25 items, and companies have to ensure the fill rate is high. While BigBasket has a fill rate of 99%, Mumbai-based online grocers Ekstop and LocalBanya have fill rates of 98% each.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Like Ekstop, LocalBanya is the brainchild of three friends who got together to start something on their own. Karan Mehrotra and Amit Naik were friends from college, but after their engineering days, they set out on different career paths. While Naik worked in the technology sector, Mehrotra joined the family food and distribution business, supplying to hotels, restaurants and flight services. While he was toying with the idea of starting an online grocery business, a neighbour sourced a special kind of rice from Mehrotra&rsquo;s business, was impressed by the quality of the grains and started sourcing from the company regularly. Soon, word spread, and several households began turning to the company for their weekly purchases. So, Mehrotra and Naik decided to come together and set up LocalBanya with acquaintance Rashi Choudhary in May 2012.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421218820.jpg" alt="LocalBanya" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Stocking up: (L-R) Karan Mehrotra, Rashi Choudhary and Amit Naik of LocalBanya</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Today, the company has over 170 employees, who help deliver groceries across Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai from their warehouses in Goregaon and Rabale. Unlike BigBasket and Ekstop, LocalBanya follows a just-in-time model to source its products, aggregating orders from its 250-odd vendors and delivering the very next day. While LocalBanya retails 10,000 products, it only stocks 700 products that it considers the fastest moving. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to replicate the infrastructure that has already been created. Big retail has invested large chunks of money creating the infrastructure and we want to leverage that,&rdquo; says Mehrotra, now CEO of LocalBanya. The company delivers up to 700-750 orders a day with an average basket size of around Rs 1,300. While the trio has invested #70 lakh as seed money, LocalBanya has also been able to raise $20 million from BCCL&rsquo;s Springboard fund, and real estate group Karamvir Avant is said to be in the final stages of closing its series B round of funding. While plans are on to expand to other cities, Naik feels that it is important to streamline operations in Mumbai first. &ldquo;We are looking at other cities, but before we do that, we want to completely leverage the growth opportunities in Mumbai,&rdquo; he explains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Click-friendly</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">For online grocers, the population density in a city such as Mumbai works in their favour because they can deliver far more orders in a given area. &ldquo;We are not constrained by demand but by capacity. Logistics and inventory management can be challenging as most vendors don&rsquo;t have a stock of the inventory, let alone having those figures in real time in our systems,&rdquo; says Naik . There is no denying that online shopping offers a definite edge in terms of convenience over your neighbourhood <em>kirana</em>. &ldquo;We are not looking to replace the <em>kiranas</em>. We just want to offer customers the range of a supermarket with the convenience of shopping from a <em>kirana</em>,&rdquo; says Abhinay Choudhari, director, BigBasket. Which makes sense given how much we depend on the neighbourhood <em>kirana</em> to get us that last-minute load of bread or bottle of milk, despite our monthly shopping trips to the supermarket. &ldquo;<em>Kiranas</em> deliver one or two items sometimes in 30 minutes taking orders through the phone and no minimum delivery requirement. That convenience is hard to beat,&rdquo; says Technopak&rsquo;s Singh. And the e-grocers agree they are not quite there yet. &ldquo;We are still figuring out how to address that segment of meeting last-minute requirements,&rdquo; says Choudhari.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While there is definite potential to scale the e-grocery business, the devil is in the details, as online groceries would need to be profitable on the customer and unit levels. According to BigBasket&rsquo;s Parekh, the gross margins in a retail business are around 20%. For offline players, rent makes up 6-9% of revenue, depending on the location, employee costs make up 4-5% and then you have to add corporate overheads to the mix. For online players, logistics costs take the place of rent, but more or less remain capped at 6%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421218914.jpg" alt="graphic 2" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">Even if one were to assume a similar employee cost and overhead structure, the difference where online retail stores score over offline stores is in shrinkage costs, where it ranges from 3% to 5% of sales for offline players and less than 1% for the online ones. Shrinkage costs are due to unsold inventory and goods lost or past their expiry. The key to improving profitability would be by increasing the share of fresh produce, which is currently at 10% but enjoys higher margins of 30-40% and increase the share of its own brand products. For instance, the share of BigBasket&rsquo;s own brand products is well over 40% of revenues. Online grocers are also looking to increase the average value of the shopping basket. &ldquo;We are constantly looking to sell a more profitable basket by including high margins products such as organic and international range of products,&rdquo; says LocalBanya&rsquo;s Choudhary. To top all this, better inventory management could add almost another percentage. With all these factors in play, a net profit margin of 6-7% is possible for e-grocers, while offline players manage just half of that figure. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">All said and done, none of these players seem to be making money at present, but the equation looks clearer for the e-grocers who can run a tighter ship at lower investments. However, scaling up the business is not going to easy. &ldquo;While the online grocery business does have positives of standard and high frequency purchases, it is a tricky business to scale up since it comes with such a complex supply chain which you have to replicate in every city you enter,&rdquo; says Technopak&rsquo;s Singh. According to her. while it will be easier to scale up in the top 8-10 cities over the next few years, capturing the fancy of tier II and III towns will be challenging unless the online grocers are able to capture a niche for themselves. Investors like Jayesh Parekh, managing director of Jungle Ventures, which invested in the angel round funding of Ekstop, believes there will be more converts as the whole connectivity infrastructure improves. Infrastructure in e-commerce is India is developing and should be on par with the rest of the developed countries in the next five years bringing more people online feels Parekh. &ldquo;India is a market that is much grocery-driven. Most homes have at least one fresh cooked meal daily and grocery is a large share of the retail spends.&nbsp; Consumers shop more frequently for groceries and fresh products, which makes online grocery a high-touch business,&rdquo; he adds&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But, eventually, it all boils down to execution and how much money the businesses burn in expanding fast and paying to acquire customers. &ldquo;You need to have a numbers and metrics-obsessed team &mdash; the second&nbsp;decimal matters in this business,&rdquo; says Unilazer&rsquo;s Shah. While companies have the challenging job of figuring out how to squeeze out those wafer-thin margins, consumers just have to click their way to a better deal.&nbsp;</p>', 'A bunch of online grocery store start-ups are ensuring that the only shopping minutes you waste are for adding items from your list to your e-cart ', '6', '', 0, '', 'go-carting-online-51', 46, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Go carting online', 'A bunch of online grocery store start-ups are ensuring that the only shopping minutes you waste are for adding items from your list to your e-cart ', '', '', '', 'Online grocery stores,Ekstop,BigBasket,E-grocers,LocalBanya', 0, NULL, '2015-01-06 18:26:08', '2015-01-14 12:32:10', '2014-10-17', 0),

This figure makes Alibaba&rsquo;s IPO the largest in American history, after Visa&rsquo;s $19.65-billion debut in 2008 and Facebook&rsquo;s $16-billion 2012 IPO. The stock, which was priced at $68 per share, valued the company at $168 billion &mdash; higher than the combined market cap of Amazon and eBay.

(53, 16, '', 'Mother of all changes', '<p class="p1">Crossing into the gates of Mother Dairy&rsquo;s original plant at Patparganj in east Delhi, the abrupt change of scene hits you first. A landmark for the city&rsquo;s residents, Mother Dairy is better known for the traffic crossing outside &mdash; chaotic, noisy and extremely congested. Once you enter, though, the manicured greens and almost military-style orderliness takes you to a different world. Few people can be seen on the premises, even as the 37-acre property, which was once the nerve centre for Delhi&rsquo;s milk supplies, quietly goes about its business. Most of the processes here are automated and work with precision to deliver toned and homogenised milk to 1,415 milk booths that Mother Dairy runs across Delhi. Tankers carrying milk from collection centres in rural areas around the city deliver their supplies after they are cleared through a rigorous but quick sample test. The automated processing plant purifies the milk and makes it ready for bulk vending machines at booths. At the ice cream unit inside the plant, people are working with an automated line that churns out 28 of Mother Dairy&rsquo;s 60 varieties, even as a group of young visitors is herded across the factory. Daily tours are conducted for students and others interested in seeing how Delhi&rsquo;s homegrown milk brand has never missed a single delivery since it started in 1974, except for one shift during the 1984 riots.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">The plant has seen many changes, from being on a desolate stretch outside Delhi to the expansion inside and the mushrooming of residential apartments around it. But nothing compares to the big transformation that has been taking place within the company since 2007. Around nine years ago, when archrival and national market leader GCMMF (Amul) made inroads into Mother Dairy&rsquo;s home market, it set in motion a series of changes that would alter the game in India&rsquo;s organised dairy business. When Amul, finally, claimed a lead in the packaged milk segment in early 2010, the transformation was already underway at Mother Dairy, with top-level exits and a new organisational structure being created. It was the beginning of a process that would turn a well-oiled but bureaucratic machine into a nimble-footed player in a rapidly evolving market for milk and milk products. Today the Rs 6,300-crore company has a presence across key markets in India with a robust innovation pipeline and an aggression that rivals the best FMCG brands. Driving all this has been its HR function, which has partnered with other business functions in order to keep pace with the company&rsquo;s ambitious plans.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>Makeover blues</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">In its earlier avatar as an NDDB-promoted organisation under the Operation Flood programme for milk procurement and distribution, Mother Dairy Fruits &amp; Vegetables (MDFVPL) was set up as a holding company in 1974. It operated through four separate entities &mdash; Mother Dairy Food Processing (MDFPL) for procurement of milk and manufacture of dairy products; Mother Dairy India (MDIL) for sales and distribution; Dhara Vegetable Oils &amp; Food (DOFCO); and a horticulture business under the Safal brand. These were projects NDDB had launched under Operation Flood and Operation Golden Flow (for oilseeds production).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Around 2005, GCMMF stopped milk supply to Mother Dairy to launch its own brand, Amul, in the NCR. That was the turning point for the &ldquo;corporatisation of Mother Dairy&rdquo;, says Sivaramakrishnan Nagarajan, managing director, MDFVPL, who joined the organisation in May 2010. Though the cooperative model was fraught with political interference and seemed unsustainable, complete dependence on the private sector for milk sourcing was ruled out. &ldquo;We needed to be a hybrid if we were to be a strong and well-managed company,&rdquo; he adds. The revamped Companies Act, 2003, which required new generation cooperatives (NGCs) to be registered as producer companies, helped overcome the shortcomings of traditional milk cooperatives. That was the model Mother Dairy went on to adopt.</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421220617.jpg" alt="graphic 1" width="850" height="580" />With India emerging as the largest milk-producing nation, the value-added dairy products space was fast heating up, Amul&rsquo;s heft in the Delhi market was growing, and the urgency to expand, geographically and organically, was hitting home at Mother Dairy. Management consultancy Accenture was roped in to redraw the organisational structure and in 2005, the four separate companies were merged into MDFVPL and instead four SBUs were created for each line of business. The new and improved Mother Dairy was now a commercial entity with a social mission.</p>\n<p class="p2">&ldquo;From multiple boards, MDs, HR and finance departments, we became a unified governance structure with one P&amp;L, one MD and one board,&rdquo; says Saugata Mitra, chief people officer, Mother Dairy, who joined in 2007 from Sony India. He was among the senior executives brought on board from consumer goods companies to lead the change at the quasi-PSU. The process of integration began in mid-2006 and was completed by early 2007. With the new structure, commercial orientation started to come in. &ldquo;We were now independent but interdependent organisations,&rdquo; says Nagarajan. &ldquo;The SBU structure gave scope for enlargement of roles at mid and senior leadership levels. Roles of functional heads started becoming crucial,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Rocky road</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">This newly created cocktail of old and new wasn&rsquo;t without its challenges. With sales teams in their early 30s, manufacturing team in their 40s and four different companies merging into one, a clash of egos was inevitable. &ldquo;People from the legacy system felt, &lsquo;what do these guys know?&rsquo;, while those who came in from outside were of the opinion that the existing employees had limited knowledge in a limited sphere,&rdquo; says Mitra. Kiran Singh, GM, corporate HR at Mother Dairy remembers it as a time of tumultuous change. &ldquo;The companies had merged on paper. But mindsets, rules, policies, designations and spans of control were still the same. Many people were working in silos,&rdquo; she says. While Nagarajan insists there were no large crises or collective issues in the integration, individual issues kept cropping up. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Vijay Kumar Singh was with MDIL when the integration took place. He joined the company in September 2005 on deputation from NDDB, where he worked for 12 years. As team leader for milk logistics, he was in charge of milk delivery from the plant to 900 booths across the city. &ldquo;I was worried about my career path and next position,&rdquo; he says, recalling that his was the only job title of its kind in the new organisation. Four years later, when Singh was redesignated deputy general manager (DGM) and his salary corrected another six months later, he realised others at his level from other Mother Dairy organisations were getting different entitlements, a spillover from their earlier positions. &ldquo;It was confusing and you didn&rsquo;t know where you stood,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">For some, the integration wasn&rsquo;t a big deal. Debasish Samaddar, DGM (administration), is an old timer with the company, having joined the Patparganj plant&rsquo;s maintenance department in 1982. Later, as part of the team that set up the Safal booths between 1986 and 1988, Samaddar says he, like his colleagues at Mangolpuri&rsquo;s horticulture processing unit, welcomed the change. &ldquo;The pay structure was better in milk, and 15% higher on average,&rdquo; he says. Similarly, Ashok Kumar, who heads procurement for the Safal SBU, admits that the integration brought in contemporary systems and policies to the horticulture unit. But he does miss the old culture. &ldquo;We were a small company then, and decision-making was fast,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421220658.jpg" alt="graphic 3" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p2">Rationalising designations was perhaps the most critical piece of the change process. Externally hired managers in the newly formed SBUs came with higher designations than those working for years in the old system who often had bigger roles. Not surprisingly, reporting became tricky. To address this, a third-party assessment was done through global employee profiling firm Thomas International. During the three-year period till 2010, around 500 people were redesignated and promoted. &ldquo;With this one stroke, the disconnect between legacy and external employees was finished once and for all,&rdquo; says Mitra.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">The role of HR had been evolving and it was restructured into two streams &mdash; operations HR and strategic HR. The strategic side would work on systems in the core areas of recruitment, performance management, training and compensation and benefits. Those in operations HR, on the other hand, would be more hands-on, working with SBU heads in their businesses, supporting them in operations and sales &mdash; hiring, training, formulating policies and incentives schemes, and so on. Since milk procurement is at the heart of Mother Dairy&rsquo;s business, there&rsquo;s even a separate HR team assigned to this in villages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">One more problem remained, though. With the average employee age at 44 years, Mother Dairy didn&rsquo;t compare favourably with its peers in the dairy and FMCG industries. A large chunk of employees were old timers, either from the beginning or having joined within 10 years of its inception. With these people set to retire, it was necessary to develop a pipeline of talent that could take over some of the roles. Also, to compete more aggressively, it had to be nimble-footed and younger, at least in market-facing roles. In 2009, Mother Dairy launched its first management trainee programme. Since then, it has added about 25 management graduates every year, from reputed institutions such as the IIMs, ISB, FMS Delhi, MDI Gurgaon, XIM Bhubaneswar, IRMA Anand and Symbiosis Pune. With around 100 of them still with the company, many have risen to senior roles. In addition, Mother Dairy has also been recruiting from regional institutions such as Praxis in Kolkata and the Amrita School of Business in Coimbatore for its executive trainee programme for frontline sales and operations roles.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Things fall apart</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">If HR was getting its act in order, at the business level, things weren&rsquo;t working out quite as planned. With declining sales growth and the internal pressures of the organisational change process, by early 2010, Mother Dairy&rsquo;s CEO Paul Thachil and MD Sanjeev Khanna had both quit; Nagarajan came on board in May the same year. Coming from business roles at Cadbury, Pepsico and finally Philips, where he served as HR head, he brought a greater appreciation for HR&rsquo;s role in driving the organisational agenda, both on a strategic and operational level. Nagarajan found a unique set of challenges at Mother Dairy. Managing the nearly opposing forces of its strong cultural legacy and an aggressive growth agenda was only part of the complexity at hand. Those coming in from other FMCG companies were expected to understand the unique social nature of Mother Dairy&rsquo;s business model. &ldquo;While the common language of business worldwide is revenue, employees here learn that we are also committed to providing a remunerative price to dairy farmers and delivering affordable nutrition to consumers,&rdquo; explains Mitra.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Again, Mother Dairy sought expert advice, bringing in PwC in 2011 to develop a competency framework for future skills that would be needed to take the company in its intended direction. 11 competencies &mdash; such as leadership, business focus, managing ambiguity and cost consciousness &mdash; were identified. Around the same time, Mother Dairy began looking outwards for growth. &ldquo;We rolled out a five-year plan to expand our manufacturing and marketing footprint,&rdquo; says Subhashis Basu, business head, dairy products.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">This meant taking calls on production and channel decisions. Jams, pickles and juices, earlier available only at Safal booths, were now being taken national. Ice cream, which had a longer shelf life of up to nine months, could be shipped from Delhi, while fermented products such as <em>dahi</em>, <em>lassi</em> and <em>chaas</em> needed to be made locally due to their 10-15 day shelf life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Today, Mother Dairy has a network of its own and contract manufacturing facilities for its portfolio. For example, in the northeast markets and hilly regions of the north where production of milk has always been low, long shelf-life products such as UHT milk in tetrapaks and dairy whiteners were found to be more suitable. These markets also depend heavily on the wholesale channel given their difficult terrain, so Mother Dairy&rsquo;s distribution had to be designed accordingly. Its newly commissioned plant in Etawah in Uttar Pradesh is geared to service such markets. It helped that Mother Dairy was transforming even as the dairy products industry picked up pace, spurred by changing consumption habits and growing acceptance of innovative products. Rabobank expects the organised dairy market to double from the current $10 billion (approximately Rs 60,000 crore) to $24 billion (Rs 144,000 crore) by 2020. Of this, the dairy products business is around Rs 20,000 crore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Bringing together its disparate sections helped Mother Dairy bring in synergies in many ways. While most milk and Safal booths are located next to each other, they had earlier sold their own range of products. Now dairy products are sold in Safal booths, while frozen peas can be found in the milk booths. The sense of purpose ingrained in milk employees is now part of the new organisational culture, Nagarajan says.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Changing tide</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">The impact of all these changes has been trickling in over the past few years (<em>See table: Change for good</em>). Manpower cost as a percentage of turnover has dropped to 3.5%, from 4.8% five years ago. &ldquo;It has been fairly constant over the past couple of years now,&rdquo; says Mitra. In absolute terms, people costs have gone up from #162 crore in FY10 to Rs 224 crore in FY14, while headcount has increased marginally from 2,991 in FY10 to 3,124 in FY14. Mitra also cites an organisation-wide engagement survey by Aon-Hewitt in which 90% employees participated in 2012-13: at 68%, Mother Dairy&rsquo;s engagement score was comparable with FMCG standards in India (70%). Meanwhile, attrition has come down from 10.06% in FY13 to 9.06% last year. &ldquo;Our recruitment cycle time has gone down and cost per hire has reduced considerably,&rdquo; Mitra adds.</p>\n<p class="p2">Aggregate revenues for the company have grown at a healthy 20% CAGR in the past five years, and Mother Dairy has a target of Rs 7,800 crore for this year. As the company&rsquo;s cost and efficiency measures, geographical expansion and organic growth of its business lines through new products and innovation all produce the desired results, the pace of growth could increase. And HR is as involved in business targets as any other department. For starters, training and equipping the sales team for each sales channel as well as new markets, where the approach is more like that of a start-up, has been HR&rsquo;s responsibility. &ldquo;Their role is ensuring good performance, training needs for a new territory, setting incentive programmes and systems and recruiting people with a high-growth mindset,&rdquo; says Nagarajan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421220351.jpg" alt="S Nagarajan" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"There is emphasis on good performance, setting incentives and recruiting people with a high-growth mindset" - S Nagarajan, MD, Mother Dairy Fruits and Vegetables</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">HR&rsquo;s business orientation is evident in its support to cost reduction, too. For some of its eastern locations and for the north-east region last May, Mother Dairy roped in an outsourcing firm for its sales and distribution of new tetrapak products such as milkshakes, cream and UHT milk. These require a capability very different from its traditional cold chain channels. &ldquo;It would have taken us thrice the time to set it up ourselves,&rdquo; says Nagarajan. But the true benefit has been in the flexibility it offers. It is the single touch-point for SBU heads and the agreement has an in-built condition for Mother Dairy to take over the system after a few years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">The department also supported the sales and marketing teams in making the booth-to-FMCG transition. For a company known by its signature booths in Delhi NCR, it was important to extend the availability of Mother Dairy&rsquo;s milk products, such as ice cream, butter, cheese, <em>paneer</em> and <em>dahi</em> to other retail outlets and modern trade. At Rs 765 crore, the dairy products SBU contributed barely 12% to revenue last year. Yet, it&rsquo;s the fastest growing among Mother Dairy&rsquo;s lines, with a CAGR of 27% and a revenue target of Rs 900 crore for FY15. Bringing down the contribution of liquid milk from 70% a few years ago to around 65% now has been a gradual process. &ldquo;Every year, we bring the figure down by 1% or so.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">More recently, the action on dairy products has shifted to markets such as Mumbai and Kolkata, which Mother Dairy has entered in the past few years. A new market needs two to three years to seed fully through pilot projects and carefully calibrated expansion. The gradual approach is due to the perishable nature of dairy products and the need to have the cold chain logistics and supply in place before attempting new outlets even within a city. &ldquo;In newer geographies, we are the challengers. HR plays a bigger role in developing the challenger mindset among our teams,&rdquo; says Basu.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">What this means is developing the framework required to store, transport and sell dairy products that require different ways of handling. So, while <em>dahi</em>, <em>lassi</em> and <em>chaas</em> have a shelf life of 7-15 days and are stored at 4 degree Celsius, they require daily replenishment. On the other hand, ice cream, with a shelf life of six to nine months, needs a frozen cold chain of -18 degree Celsius and can be restocked once or twice a week. Tetrapak products need what Nagarajan calls &ldquo;a grocer&rsquo;s mindset&rdquo; at the FMCG level. &ldquo;This meant a new shape of the sales organisation, marketing organisation and supply chain for each category of products. HR has also helped us create a team for modern trade,&rdquo; says Basu, who also credits HR with starting the pay-for-performance culture in sales. Mother Dairy&rsquo;s recognition systems go beyond monetary rewards, he adds, recognising contribution in areas such as coaching and mentoring as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">As the company looks at new products lines such as processed fruits and vegetables and ready-to-eat foods to bring in higher margins, Mitra says HR&rsquo;s mandate is likely to be more aligned to the business in the future. For instance, the outsourcing model is something that could be applied to other areas as well. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s flexible and faster to execute. We are asking ourselves if the plug-and-play approach can be developed further to other areas, such as warehousing and logistics,&rdquo; says Mitra. Such thinking never came naturally to the organisation in the past. &ldquo;We now explore new ways to support the business in innovative ways. It&rsquo;s an orientation change for HR.&rdquo; The change definitely seems to have put Mother Dairy on the milky way of growth. &nbsp;</p>', 'How Mother Diary used people power to transform a bureaucratic dairy behemoth into a dynamic dairy products major ', '19', '', 0, '', 'mother-of-all-changes-53', 48, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Mother of all changes', 'How Mother Diary used people power to transform a bureaucratic dairy behemoth into a dynamic dairy products major ', '', '', '', 'Mother Dairy,Dairy Industry,HR', 0, NULL, '2015-01-06 18:49:50', '2015-01-14 13:01:15', '2014-10-17', 0);

(54, 16, '', 'Gamification', '<p class="p1">Last year, when it was gearing up to aggressively push mobile internet services to customers, Vodafone India took the help of its endearing brand mascots, the Zoozoos. Apart from its customer service and field sales force, it also needed to get the rest of its 12,000-odd employees to understand and evangelise mobile internet services to their friends, family and customers. The solution &mdash; a gamified learning module that would take the monotony out of the process and be fun too. The game was designed like a sci-fi adventure with Zentians, a special race of the Zoozoos, racing to find another planet after their own is destroyed by solar explosions. Through a Super Zoozoo avatar, the player has to find a way to restore the destroyed mobile internet network. By collecting Vodafone mobile internet products such as recharge coupons, apps and services, players are required to cross five levels to finally restore the network. Along the way, they are made aware of the company&rsquo;s mobile internet offerings and are ready with the knowledge needed to explain and sell its products and services in this space. Five top scorers from across the country had a playoff at the company&rsquo;s corporate headquarters in Mumbai, with the winner getting a Blackberry Z10 and runners up winning other smartphones.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Developed by Tata Interactive Systems (TIS), the Zentians game helped Vodafone&rsquo;s agents get up to speed on a critical focus area and a new business driver for the company. &ldquo;Our app awareness was very low before this. Once we started playing the game, we began Googling for answers, discussing specifications with tech experts we knew and talking about the game with our colleagues,&rdquo; says Sambit Dey, manager, service delivery, at Vodafone&rsquo;s Mumbai corporate office, who was then manager for call centre operations at the West Bengal circle in Kolkata. The exercise, which began in June 2013, was played by everyone in the corporate office and circle offices, from the finance department to the IT network and HR teams from senior executives to their secretaries. Scores and top scorers were updated live on leaderboards every day. Top scorers from each circle were invited for regional championships, where the playoffs were broadcast on a <br /> giant screen.</p>\n<p class="p2">&ldquo;Zentians was not mandatory training but pull-based learning,&rdquo; says Vivek Mathur, chief commercial officer, Vodafone India. The customer service (CS) team, which reports to HR, organised and ran the game for around six months, ending in January 2014. In the early day, CS team &lsquo;champions&rsquo; in each circle would leave tent cards on employees&rsquo; desks in the morning with cryptic teasers, with an employee dressing up in a Zoozoo costume and making rounds of the office. CS champions had their own incentives in each circle &mdash; there were rewards for 100% participation (someone who played at least once). The Odisha circle was the only one to qualify, while many reached 90% participation levels. Some even offices set up special gaming zones with bean bags and large screens to play on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421221484.jpg" alt="Rajat Paharia" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Gamification combines the newest research about motivation, big data and interactive design" - Rajat Paharia, founder, Bunchball</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Gamification, a new-age term coined to represent the application of gaming techniques in real-life situations, has been a buzzword in India for at least a couple of years now. Rajat Paharia, founder and chief product officer of US-based gamification solutions company Bunchball and hailed as the &lsquo;father&rsquo; of the modern gamification industry, explains why it works for business. &ldquo;Gamification combines three essential components: the newest research about motivation, big data and interactive design,&rdquo; he says. Globally, companies such as Microsoft, Nike and Coca-Cola have deployed gamification to address business challenges or to make activities around customers and employees more interesting and effective. In India, it is still uncharted territory for most, even as leading names, primarily in technology-led services, have attempted some form of gamified application or other.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Getting started</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">Estimates put the global market for gamification solutions at roughly $5.5 billion by end-2018. Gartner had termed gamification to be at the peak of its &lsquo;hype cycles&rsquo; early last year, where it was thought of being more of a fad, with unrealistic expectations and limited results. &ldquo;While we are positive on the longer term impact of gamification, we are less positive in the short/immediate term. We predict that by 2014, 80% of current gamified applications will fail to meet business objectives, primarily due to poor design,&rdquo; Gartner industry analyst Brian Burke had said in a report. Those who get it right, however, will move from games and fun to using gaming techniques for driving performance through a clearer definition of business objectives. &ldquo;Accordingly, by 2015, 40% of Global 1,000 organizations will use gamification as the primary mechanism to transform business operations,&rdquo; he adds in the report.</p>\n<p class="p2">Already, global corporations have used it in areas such as customer engagement, loyalty programmes and in sales, and are extending it to their internal operations and employees. The driving philosophy behind gamification is the same, though &mdash; engaging young consumers or employees through motivators they find most exciting: competitive challenges, instant rewards and bragging rights. From onboarding new talent to getting existing employees updated on policies and procedures, it usually begins with areas considered important but dry in nature. Training and learning programmes, therefore, are the first port of call. &ldquo;You are learning by doing rather than reading or listening,&rdquo; says Rajiv Jayaraman, founder, Knolskape, a Bengaluru-based gamification company.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Between March and April this year, close to 32,000 Accenture employees across its India operations got to play a unique game and call it work. Titled &lsquo;Path to success, the Accenture way&rsquo;, it tested employees&rsquo; alignment to the corporate brand based on knowledge of the organisation&rsquo;s culture and business objectives. Players moved up a simulated corporate ladder, and with a successful run they became the boss of the virtual organization. The game design was kept simple and loosely modelled on the &lsquo;snakes and ladders&rsquo; approach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Meant for both existing employees and for potential hires, the game allows the player to choose between a male and a female avatar and play across four levels of increasing difficulty. By rolling virtual dice through mouse clicks, the avatar walks as many steps as the number that comes up, to reveal questions. These are based on the focus areas of the company in the current year, its new growth objectives, the latest information on careers at the company and its ethics and compliance policies. Upon answering a question correctly, the player gets to move through a virtual door to another level. The starting point is the reception of the company; from there, players travel through a training zone to the working or bay area and finally end up at the boardroom. Getting the answer wrong thrice sends the player back to the start.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">The need to bring in game-like tools to the workplace becomes apparent when you consider the size of a globally distributed workforce such as Accenture&rsquo;s. With close to 300,000 employees across 56 countries at the $28.6-billion IT services to consulting corporation, regular information dissemination tools such as the intranet, emails and even social media often fall short of the desired objective, says Manoj Biswas, managing director, HR, at Accenture India. Fun and games assume a more serious and effective way to get the message across to the younger workforce. &ldquo;They find traditional learning programmes monotonous to attend,&rdquo; says Biswas. &ldquo;As a medium, it has worked very well for learning, recruitment, employee engagement and feedback.&rdquo; Indeed, given that such games are supported by hints and allow participants to tally their answers with information on the company intranet, corporate emails and the internet so that players read and internalise details about the company.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">At cosmetics major L&rsquo;Oreal, gamification is a significant part of its recruitment process. Young professionals can test their skills and get acquaianted with the company&rsquo;s culture through an online game called Reveal that requires solving business challenges across the company&rsquo;s various functions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">A simpler gaming application helps Bookmyshow hire better promoters for its turnkey events business such as IPL, ISL and Comicon. Anil Makhija, VP Service Delivery and Operations, Bookmyshow, informs that over 1,500 promoters have so far played the online game from cybercaf&eacute;s or even their homes, to test their suitability for these short term assignments.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>The gaming universe</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">As interest in gamification grows, the business ecosystem is evolving too. While service providers such as Tata Interactive Systems (TIS) and Kwench in India integrate games into their existing suite of tech-based employee engagement and training services, others such as MindTickle, eMee and Knolskape have positioned themselves as gamification vendors. Pure gaming companies, though, are staying away. &ldquo;We are a (gaming) products company; we&rsquo;re not interested in services,&rdquo; says Alok Kejriwal, co-founder, Games2Win.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">So far, vendors have conducted most gamification projects for overseas clients. That&rsquo;s changing now. For Kwench, a corporate library and employee engagement services firm, nearly 95% of revenue comes from within the country, according to co-founder Sunder Nookala. Working with its co-founder and technology partner SmartCloud Infotech of Pune, it gamifies areas such as performance management, employee induction, code of conduct and ethics, incentives and rewards. He terms these as topics or areas that by nature are &ldquo;repetitive, albeit mandatory&rdquo;. Bringing in a fun element is only part of the solution. Nookala explains: &ldquo;A gamified solution essentially draws on what are called game mechanics. These include competition, sense of achievement, intense engagement, levels and leaderboards that tap into the deep emotional level of an individual. To this extent, a lot a behavioural science is involved.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421225491.jpg" alt="Nookala" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Don''t expect gamification to be a silver bullet or panacea for solving engagement problems" - Sunder Nookala, Co-founder, Kwench</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Once the problem area is identified, Kwench conducts a two-day immersion session with the client to brainstorm the idea and generate mock concepts. After the final concept is agreed upon in writing, Nookala and his team work on creating the actual program to be rolled out, which can be either in 2D or 3D format. It&rsquo;s a growing business, fetching a couple of crores on average during the past two years, and expected to touch Rs 5 crore in a year&rsquo;s time. Co-founded in 2008, the IAN-backed Kwench managed an overall revenue of Rs 12 crore in FY13 and is looking to double that figure in the current year. Nookala expects the interest in gamification to gather steam in India over the next three to four years. &ldquo;We expect that serious game development will catch up on two fronts &mdash; Indian companies adopting gamification as a tool to engage employees, clients and channel partners; and outsourcing of game development by global companies to India,&rdquo; he says. He also cautions against getting carried away by the initial noise around the idea. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect gamification to be a silver bullet or a panacea for solving engagement problems. Gamification certainly drives engagement, but intent to engage comes first,&rdquo; Nookala adds.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Putting games to work</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">At Mindtickle, a learning solutions company that has deployed gamification in over 250 assignments, around 40% of its business comes from India. The company clocked revenue of over Rs 3 crore last year and has worked with clients such as Bookmyshow, SAP and eBay. The firm works on the software as a service (SaaS) model, billing on a per-user basis. &ldquo;When it comes to gamification, a one-size-fits-all approach doesn&rsquo;t work. Specific gamification elements need to be employed based on the learners. For example, leaderboards work for sales reps but not for product managers,&rdquo; says Mohit Garg, co-founder, Mindtickle.</p>\n<p class="p2">Investments in gamification vary according to very specific needs. While some vendors work on a one-time fee that could range anywhere between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 50 lakh depending on the time involved and the scale of deployment, many others work on a pay-per-use model priced anywhere between $5-20 per user. eMee, a part of Pune-based IT services company Persistent Systems, was launched as a gamification services provider in early 2010. Its CEO Siddhesh Bhobe explains that expenditure on gamification is still quite small in India, contributing 10% of business for eMee. &ldquo;The US continues to be an important market for us,&rdquo; he says. While a lot has been changing in terms of growing IT expenditure by Indian corporates, Bhobe says there is still a lot of fence-sitting. &ldquo;Companies here are hesitant and decision cycles here are longer,&rdquo; he says. From clients in the pharma and manufacturing sectors to taxi services, eMee works in both the customer loyalty and employee engagement spaces. It is the former from which it gets a bulk of its revenue as the ticket size is higher compared with HR engagement programmes.</p>\n<p class="p2">Making gamification work takes more than just adding a game to a business situation. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t make it an overhead to what employees are doing already. It should integrate seamlessly into the work processes, or else it&rsquo;s guaranteed to fail,&rdquo; says Bhobe. Understanding what drives and motivates people is also key to successful game design. &ldquo;Gifts and vouchers make little sense. Instead, non-monetary rewards, such as lunch with the CEO or a ticket to an international conference, work best,&rdquo; he adds. Leaderboards with scores also serve a similar purpose, increasing participation and keeping interest levels alive throughout the duration of the game. But gamification requires senior management mandate to succeed. &ldquo;Employees often wonder, &lsquo;Is anybody watching?&rsquo;. If they don&rsquo;t get the right signals, they drop out,&rdquo; says Bhobe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421221909.jpg" alt="Siddhesh Bhobe" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Gamification should integrate seamlessly into the work processes, or else it''s guaranteed to fail" - Siddhesh Bhobe, CEO, eMee</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Gamification is a significant component of the training process at SunGard Technology, a US-based financial services technology company with $2.8 billion in revenue and 11,800 employees worldwide.&nbsp;It works in the education, public sector and financial services space. Its BFSI vertical has retail banks, hedge funds and investment banks as customers.&nbsp;With 2,600 people working at its Pune and Bengaluru software development centres, close to 70% of product R&amp;D happens out of its India operations, with over 100 products developed from here. A key problem was the various points of productivity loss in the organisation. Due to the iterative nature of the work, a lot of time was being lost in back-and-forth communication between people. Meetings and conference calls were another area where time was being wasted without goals being clearly articulated. &ldquo;We wanted people to become aware where they were losing time and efficiency. These are organisational habits whose impact grows as the company grows in size,&rdquo; says Sharad Verma, senior director, HR, SunGard Technology in India.</p>\n<p class="p2">Earlier this year, the company&rsquo;s India HR team developed a game titled &lsquo;Who killed Productivity?&rsquo;. Modelled after crime investigation thrillers, the game was designed around the murder of a girl named Productivity. Movie-style posters and other teasers were put up across on the intranet to promote participation.&nbsp;The central character was a typical SunGard employee: a 28-year-old with around five years of work experience. &ldquo;We wanted people to identify with her. So she was a good performer at work with a life outside office &mdash; a circle of friends and a social network,&rdquo; says Verma.&nbsp;When she&rsquo;s found dead in her apartment, a detective is sent to investigate.&nbsp;The animated investigation proceeds through six subplots where the detective discovers different aspects of her life that led to lower productivity. For instance, in the managing emails episode, the detective discovers over 200 unread emails in her inbox, a sign of poorly managed communications. Another touches upon the importance of goal-setting, with friends recounting how the central character lacked clarity of purpose in her life. &ldquo;There was no teaching or preaching,&rdquo; says Verma, &ldquo;but the game reminded participants of the areas where they were being less productive.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Around 1,800 employees in India and another 200 at SunGard&rsquo;s Tunisia operations played the game, with 76 winners getting all answers right. The game generated buzz and was discussed widely. It was even picked up by SunGard&rsquo;s global HR team for its own members. &ldquo;Gamification is not about games. It&rsquo;s about amplifying the effect of an existing, core experience by applying proven motivational techniques so that companies can drive more sales, stronger collaboration, better ROI, deeper loyalty and higher customer satisfaction,&rdquo; says Bunchball&rsquo;s Paharia</p>\n<p class="p2">As an example, Bunchball&rsquo;s work with RMH Franchise Corporation, which operates over 130 Applebee&rsquo;s casual dining restaurants across the US, involved creating a gamified website Bee Block for the latter&rsquo;s employees, who work in hourly shifts. Apart from managing their profiles, these workers can log on to participate in contests that are automated and broadcast in real time via Bee TVs placed strategically throughout restaurant workstations. Early results from the pilot programme show a 20% reduction in employee turnover, in a business where average turnover rates are as high as 125%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Reaching the next level</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">While early experiments with gamification in India haven&rsquo;t tapped all benefits, Paharia says there&rsquo;s proof that it&rsquo;s working well for businesses in the US. In most cases, it&rsquo;s about a quantifiable business result. &ldquo;At Bunchball, we&rsquo;ve seen gamification increase engagement in 50% of employees targeted, reduce onboarding (time) by 91% and increase interaction with training programs by a whopping 145%; in each company, we have been able to map these activities to business results &mdash; 15-18% increase in sales revenue, 20% reduction in employee recruitment costs and a 4X conversion on purchases,&rdquo; says Paharia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Anita Ramachandran, founder of Mumbai-based HR consulting firm Cerebrus, points to the fact that gamification has always existed in other forms. For instance, financial services firms have used the &lsquo;shadow portfolio&rsquo; as a training tool for portfolio risk management. IT firms have been early adopters of gamification in its current form, she adds. Ramachandran considers gamification to be more of a ` in employee learning programmes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more suitable for large teams such as sales and operations,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">At TIS, the Serious Games division has been working with clients &mdash; ranging from banks to cruise liners and FMCG companies &mdash; on web-based training solutions for nearly a decade now.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421225674.jpg" alt="Nadkarni" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"The domestic market is growing. We get 20% of Serious Games business from Indian clients" - Durgesh Nadkarni, VP, Tata Interactive Systems</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Durgesh Nadkarni, VP and chief games designer at the Serious Games centre in Mumbai, says gamification has brought in a new level of interest among corpora tes, who use it f or training and assessment. Its ten-member team comprises graphic designers, game developers, coders and creative writers. Its project for a cruise line operator, for instance, was to gamify training for the client&rsquo;s housekeeping staff. Through a time-bound interactive game, staff members grasped instructions on how to place items in the bathroom and which chemicals to use in specific areas for cleaning. In India, adoption is often hindered by conventionally ingrained attitudes towards use of such tools at the workplace. &ldquo;Companies find it hard to trivialise or gamify something that&rsquo;s serious,&rdquo; agrees Games2Win&rsquo;s Kejriwal. TIS&rsquo;s first domestic gamification engagement was for a private sector bank, where the function of cheque verification was made interesting through an animated game. Nadkarni recalls that senior executives at the bank were initially skeptical. &ldquo;Of late, the India market is definitely getting hotter. We get 20% of our Serious Games business from domestic clients,&rdquo; says Nadkarni. It is up to early adopters to take the endgame to a completely different level.

The rally has come on the back of 13% growth in total income and 20% growth in profit for FY14. The robust performance continued in the first quarter of FY15, with 10% and 18% growth in net income and profit, respectively. Making the most of the good peformance, MD and CEO Shikha Sharma sold 80,000 shares at Rs 409 on September 2 for #3.27 crore, bringing down her holding to 120,000 shares.

At Rs 399 a share, her holding is worth around Rs 8 crore. The resultant transactions have meant that Sharma took home Rs 1.73 crore (pre-tax).

(56, 20, '', 'Hollow Gains', '<p class="p1">IPOs are back in fashion, and how. Snowman Logistics, a subsidiary of Gateway Distriparks and the latest IPO entrant on the bourses, made a dashing debut earlier this month, with gains of an astounding 68% on day one of listing. With that kind of return, Snowman comes second only to PG Electroplast, which listed in 2011 at Rs 412 for a 96% premium. Of course, it&rsquo;s another story that the founders of PG Electroplast have since been banned from the markets for manipulating stock prices.</p>\n<p class="p3">Snowman&rsquo;s share listed at Rs 79 against its issue price of #47. In other words, had an investor invested Rs 1 lakh in the IPO and sold on the day it listed, he or she would have made a cool Rs 68,000. However, those gains are only on paper. No one would have really been able to pocket those kinds of gains, as the issue was grossly oversubscribed, making it impossible for people to get the number of shares they applied for. For those who did not borrow any funds and applied for the IPO with their own money, there is the opportunity cost of the money to contend with.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But the ones left with the worst return were those who borrowed money. For an investor who had applied for 5,000 shares with an equity to debt ratio of 1:4 (that is, for every rupee of the investor&rsquo;s own contribution, the loan amount was Rs 4), the return on investment would have been a paltry 3.3%, against the 68% premium at which the scrip got listed. Even if one borrowed money through an application supported by blocked amount (ASBA) account, the return would have been only a shade better at 4.5%. The ASBA facility was introduced to eliminate the hassle of waiting for application money to be refunded post allotment. For example, if an investor bids for 100 shares for Rs 20 each and the issue is subscribed ten times, he or she will receive 10 shares and only the cost of that chunk, that is, Rs 200, will be debited. This way, the applicant only pays for the shares allotted and is saved the trouble of blocking the entire amount.</p>\n<p class="p3">In fact, brokerages and some non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are now financing margin money through ASBA at low interest rates of 7-8%, compared with 12-14% for normal margin funding. Market expert Ambareesh Baliga says, &ldquo;ASBA allows brokerages to cut down on interest rates. The financier opens an account in the name of the borrower to utilise funds deposited for ASBA applications. The borrower will earn interest on those funds, and assuming he or she earns 6% interest and the financier charges 13%, the cost of funds comes down to 7%.&rdquo; However, a cheaper mode of leverage is no guarantee for higher returns for investors, and that&rsquo;s what has ended up disappointing them big time. The contrast in absolute listing gains and what the applicant actually ended up making is a result of the oversubscription numbers.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421228911.jpg" alt="IPO1" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"ASBA allows brokerages to cut down on interest rates, with cost of funds coming down to 7%" - Ambareesh Baliga, independent market expert</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In Snowman&rsquo;s case, a large section of investors &mdash; mostly high net worth individuals (HNI) &mdash; leveraged their applications through the ASBA facility. The issue was subscribed 60 times, receiving 195 crore bids for an issue size of 3.25 crore shares at a price band of Rs 44-47. The retail segment of the Snowman IPO &mdash; the second one to hit the capital markets in FY15 after amusement park operator Wonderla Holidays &mdash; was subscribed 41 times, while the non-institutional investor segment, comprising sophisticated investors such as corporates and HNIs, was subscribed a whopping 218 times. This meant that an investor who had applied for 100 Snowman shares received only 1.6 shares, which severely impacted his or her return. In IPOs that are oversubscribed several times, investors have little room to make money, given the negligible allotment of shares compared with what they had applied for.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The risk for investors is only compounded when a public offer does not see a strong listing. Consider this: Wonderla, which listed at a 26% premium, is among the top 10 IPOs since 2009 to have delivered record first-day gains. In this case, given that the oversubscription was 38 times, an investor using the ASBA facility would have earned 2.3%, and an investor relying on normal margin funding would have made just 1.1%. Still, investors are not getting any wiser. Investment bankers like B Madhuprasad, non-executive chairman of Keynote Corporate Services, feel that investors are increasingly looking at making a quick buck in IPOs. &ldquo;Almost everyone who is investing in new issues is looking for short-term listing gains. A typical investor encashes on the day of listing and re-enters the stock once the price falls.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s typically the case with all bullish markets.</p>\n<p class="p3">Given the backdrop of negative payoffs or dismal risk-adjusted return, most primary market pundits advise investors to stay away from leveraging. Prithvi Haldea, founder chairman of Prime Database, which tracks the primary market, is dead against IPO financing, which is encouraging the retail investor population to turn into speculators. &ldquo;The primary market should be a long-term and vibrant place for needy corporates to access low cost of funding. But today, it is a punter&rsquo;s paradise, with leveraged investors happy to make money till such a time as it covers their interest costs. The HNI portions of both Shemaroo and Snowman were oversubscribed by more than 200 times. This sends wrong signals to small investors, who perceive the stock as a reliable investment with good fundamentals. Regulators should come down heavily on this,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421229019.jpg" alt="Leverage pain" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">Investors should be wary of assuming oversubscriptions to be an indication of strong listing. Though it may mean high demand and a strong listing, oversubscription may end up diminishing return if an investor fails to get decent allotments to make large enough gains to offset the interest cost, in case of margin funding. There have been several issues over the past few years that have listed at a discount to their issue prices. For instance, Va Tech Wabag and Godrej Properties listed at around 50% discount to their issue price. An investor who applied for 5,000 shares &mdash; borrowing 80% of the funds required &mdash; in Va Tech Wabag at an issue price of Rs 1,310 would have lost Rs 1.2 lakh (including interest cost) on an investment of Rs 2.2 lakh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But investor memory is short. Right now, the strong listing of Snowman and Wonderla has sparked hope among investors that there could be a repeat performance with other IPOs as well. HCC is looking to list its subsidiary, Lavasa, and others, such as GVK Airport &mdash; a subsidiary of infrastructure company GVK &mdash; are waiting in the wings. But experts urge investors to be cautious.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">However, it is still too early to call this a revival. In fact, so far, 2014 is turning out to be one of the worst years for the primary markets; till the end of September, two floats managed to raise only Rs 378 crore, compared with over Rs 37,000 crore in 2010. &ldquo;When Justdial entered the market last year, people started claiming that the IPO market has been revived. But there were no new issues for a year after that,&rdquo; says Haldea. He believes that during a boom and bust cycle, strong firms with reasonable valuations get oversubscribed, followed by bad ones raising money at attractive valuations; the vicious circle is complete when bad companies go public at exorbitant valuations. The last time the IPO market peaked was FY08, when any and every company with terrible fundamentals managed to raise money.

(57, 20, '', 'Coming home to...', '<p class="p1">When it comes to the popularity different businesses enjoy with investors, analysts and the markets, the textiles industry figures quite low down the pecking order. Which is why the attention centered on Siyaram Silk Mills comes as a bit of surprise. SS Shetty, the textile legend&rsquo;s CFO, is swamped with interview requests from analysts and investors alike when we meet him at his fifth-floor office in Mumbai&rsquo; posh Worli area. But before we can question him about the investor interest in his company &mdash; leading mutual funds such as ICICI have been investors for quite some time, with DSP BlackRock Micro Cap Funds (in the June 2014 quarter) and Reliance Mutual Fund (in August) being the latest entrants &mdash; Shetty turns the tables and asks us to explain the phenomenon.</p>\n<p class="p3">What, then, is driving Siyaram&rsquo;s share price rise? This definitely is a difficult question to answer &mdash; the company has grown in an industry characterised by a very low survival rate. By now, even the <em>paanwallahs</em> on Dalal Street know that textile stocks are usually duds. Short of a land bank &mdash; the only other explanation for high textile stock prices &mdash; few trends could explain Siyaram&rsquo;s recent rally. But Shetty instantly dismisses the theory. &ldquo;Unlike many other textile companies, which are cashing in on large land banks, we have nothing of that sort. It is the success of our core business and the efforts we put in over the last few years that are now paying off,&rdquo; he says. This bit is true &mdash; a cursory glance at the numbers will show that the company&rsquo;s fiscal performance has been improving, which could be one reason why long-term investors are betting on the stock.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Over the past decade, sales have grown at 16%, while profits have shown a much robust growth of 27%. This growth has been primarily driven by its internal resources, without much reliance on borrowed funds, making Siyaram one of the few companies to make return on equity (RoE) in excess of 20%. Add to this operating margins of 11% and #70 crore of cash from operations, partly used for distributing dividends. But will Siyaram be able to sustain these numbers in the future? Shetty definitely seems to think so. &ldquo;The survival rate is very low in this business, and one vital reason for that is promoter greed. We have been conservative in our approach, all the while sticking to our finances and strengths. We have never gone overboard in expanding our capacities or entered unrelated businesses with aggressive borrowings,&rdquo; he asserts.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Playing it safe</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Shetty, who has been with the company since its inception, was elevated as the CFO three years back. His eye for detail and skill at managing the company&rsquo;s finances have probably played a key role in Siyaram&rsquo;s success story. But the key question remains &mdash; what is behind the company&rsquo;s growth spurt? We reserve that question for company chairman and managing director Ramesh Poddar, who incorporated Siyram at the age of 22 in 1978, after completing his BSc. &ldquo;What is working in Siyaram&rsquo;s favour are our conscious efforts to continuously drift away from the inherent weaknesses that this industry and most of its players face,&rdquo; he explains.</p>\n<p class="p3">The first weakness, Poddar points out, is that the textile industry is highly capital-intensive, which means that most players build huge capacities, largely through borrowed funds. Invariably, when the downturn hits home, they are hurt badly and have to shut shop thanks to the interest burden. &ldquo;In the past, many companies have gone bankrupt and the ones who are still around are surviving on land banks. To mitigate this, we reacted to market demands conservatively, deliberately increasing capacities gradually, in tandem with our finances. We are happier buying 20% to 40% of our requirements from outside and outsourcing processes instead of building huge capacities that cannot be absorbed by the markets,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Poddar&rsquo;s claim holds true &mdash; Siyaram&rsquo;s current debt to equity is stable at 0.9 times, one of the lowest in the industry. Except in FY08, when debt to equity touched 1.98 times, the figure has remained at 1.26 times over the last decade. That, and the company&rsquo;s ability to service interest costs. The company&rsquo;s interest coverage ratio, which is calculated by dividing its earnings before interest and taxes by the interest cost, has remained at an average of 4.3 times over the last decade, highlights its conservative approach towards funding.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The other big weakness, says Poddar, is that the textile industry is highly competitive, with several organised and unorganised sector players in the fray. This intense competition leaves very little for textiles manufacturers. &ldquo;Thankfully, we have been building our brands since inception and focus has remained on the same. In fact, when companies were fighting over urban customers, we were silently building our brand in rural and mass markets. We have simply extended that culture, which is now yielding good results,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Massy does it</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Siyaram built its advantages mainly in poly viscose-based fabrics, where larger players fear to tread thanks to high competition, high costs and challenging distribution networks. Today, it continues to generate 80% of its revenues from tier 2 and tier 3 cities, having established itself as the largest player in the suiting and shirting business in India with a 4% market share. Though this may seem minuscule, this only underscores the killing competition in this business. With an annual production capacity of 6.5 crore metre, Siyaram is the largest player in the poly viscose-based fabric segment, generating about 76% of its revenue from the fabric business. &ldquo;Viscose-based fabrics account for the fastest-growing and largest-selling segment in the business and as a market leader, Siyaram has held a very strong position in this market over the past 25 years,&rdquo; says Arvind Singhal, chairman of Technopak, a corporate advisory firm with an interest in the textile sector.</p>\n<p class="p3">Indeed, the company has worked hard for its success with viscose-based blended fabrics. &ldquo;Because of our focus on these fabrics, we were considered marginal players or irrelevant in the market in the past, as most players were chasing fabrics such as cotton, pure polyester, wool and others. Today, our focus on viscose is paying us huge dividends because of the demand and the growing size of the market,&rdquo; says Shetty. That&rsquo;s seconded by Prashant Agarwal, co-founder and managing director of textile advisory firm Wazir Advisors. &ldquo;In the past, viscose-based fabrics were considered low-end compared with costly wool and cotton fabrics. However, viscose- and polyester-based fabrics have fast replaced all other fabrics due to cost advantages, improvement in strength and looks, and adaptability to climate. Which is why this largest-selling segment in the textile chain is growing even faster on the back of existing demand and increased use as a substitute,&rdquo; says Agarwal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421229310.jpg" alt="graphic1" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">Siyaram&rsquo;s dominance in the segment has also been because of its strong branding in the fabrics business, where it has developed several other brands to reach a variety of customer preferences. Apart from Siyaram, which is meant for the mass market, it boasts of premium brands such as J Hampstead and Mistair &mdash; the company has roped in actors Hrithik Roshan and Neil Nitin Mukesh, respectively, to back the brands. These properties have helped it move up the value chain and offer products to fit different needs, which may not have been possible under Siyaram. The brands now account for about 24% of its branded fabrics. The company is also leveraging its experience in viscose-based fabrics by introducing two premium brands &mdash; Zenesis and Moretti &mdash; in the cotton-based fabrics space.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The consumer shift in preference towards branded products has been brewing for a long time, but the industry has reached a juncture where awareness, availability and price have converged into a tipping point. &ldquo;The launch of two premium cotton brands, entry into linen fabrics and increased focus on J Hampstead will hold the company in good stead as urban growth catches up with rural,&rdquo; points out Harsh Mehta, analyst at HDFC Securities. The branded fabrics business works for Siyaram as long as customers see value in buying fabric and getting it stitched but, increasingly, people have started opting for readymade garments. &ldquo;Over the years, the over-the-counter sales market for fabrics &mdash; at one point, 70% of the total market &mdash; has shrunk to 35%, as more and more people are buying ready-to-wear garments,&rdquo; says Agarwal. That means the big challenge for Siyaram is how to prepare for these new realities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Early in the game</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Much before ready-made garments became the norm, Siyaram had ventured into this business as early as the 1990s, a decision that is now paying off. This move also made sense because of Siyaram&rsquo;s own fabric manufacturing capacity and distribution and marketing capabilities. Initially, the company launched its own garments business, starting with men&rsquo;s readymade garments under the Oxemberg brand with Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan as brand ambassador. That was in 1993; Oxemberg sales have grown at a strong pace since then. In a bid to replicate the success of Oxemberg and further de-risk its business, Siyaram expanded its brand portfolio with a greater emphasis on garments and brought on Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dohni as the brand ambassador around 2006. Even though the garments arm now constitutes 17% of its total revenues, the Street has its reservations about the success of Siyaram&rsquo;s foray into a market that is already populated by larger and much more established brands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Which means that these brands need not just time but also a mammoth amount of money to grow &mdash; the company spent close to Rs 30 crore-35 crore towards this end in FY13 and about Rs 50 crore in FY14. Sure, this has helped them shore up contribution from garments from a mere 10 % in FY11, but Siyaram&rsquo;s brands are still evolving and any real benefits from them might only translate into hard numbers in the longer term.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421229352.jpg" alt="graphic 2" width="850" height="580" />&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Not everyone views rising competition in the branded space as a concern for Siyaram, though. Says Singhal of Technopak, &ldquo;I do not see a threat to Siyaram from larger brands on two counts: first, they themselves have a strong brand positioning, with Oxemberg being the largest-selling brand in this segment; and second, its large manufacturing capacities have helped the company capitalise on demand for fabrics, making it supplier to some of the biggest brands in the ready-to-wear segment.&rdquo; Even otherwise, its brands are mostly targeted towards the mass segment, where the company has brand equity and marketing capabilities. Besides, the company is able to manage its growth because of the overall sluggish growth in the fabric business. For instance, in FY14, the company&rsquo;s garments business recorded a robust 49% growth in revenue, driven mainly by 31% growth in volumes and 14% growth in realisations, which indicates that the company is able to exercise its pricing power.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Defining the future</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">This transition (from fabrics to branded garments), along with a sharper focus, is helping Siyaram improve margins, which were largely reflecting the commoditised nature of its business. The company has an operating profit margin of about 11%, closer to some of the companies in the premium and branded segment &mdash; Raymond has margins of about 11% and Arvind 14%. As the proportion of the garments business goes up and sales from the branded segments improve, there are expectations that the company might actually manage high margins and display an improvement in its return ratios. Unlike its fabric business, which has grown at about 12-13% over the last three years, its garments arm has been growing at a much faster clip of 22-25%. The higher margins from the garments business, in fact, are helping the company improve its margins and return ratios.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421229389.jpg" alt="graphic 3" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">Apart from its existing business and the brands Siyaram has launched so far, the company&rsquo;s growth will be driven by the launch of new brands, entry into new categories and the uptick in clothing sales. &ldquo;The company has recently entered the women&rsquo;s ethnic wear market under the brand Siya. Though the brand is relatively small, with annual turnover of just Rs 25 crore, it is likely to scale up in the next two years,&rdquo; says Varun Chakri, analyst at Karvy Stock Broking. The best part of this growth story is that it is set to come without much capex and spending. &ldquo;Since the company is focusing on the garment segment, we believe that capex requirement will be at the minimum, as the company can easily outsource manufacturing. Currently, the company outsources 40% of its garments requirement, while 60% is met through in-house manufacturing. The company aims to reverse the ratio to 60:40 by FY16,&rdquo; says Tejashwini Kumari, analyst, Angel Broking. Improvement in margins without much requirement of funds for the business will enable the company to generate even higher cash flows in the years to come, helping it retire its debt. &ldquo;We aim to reduce our debts further and keep just a percentage of cash in hand for suitable acquisitions in future,&rdquo; says Poddar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Meanwhile, the market has begun capitalising on this transition and is looking at its valuation gap to narrow down in line with some of the pure garment players. The stock has seen a run-up in share price &mdash; 187% in the last six months to Rs 757 &mdash; leading to valuations going up. Since part of the re-rating and expectations are built into the share price, this could mean little scope for gains in the near term. The stock is currently trading at around 11 times trailing earnings, which is still reasonable compared with Arvind and Raymond, both trading at 21 times to 22 times their trailing earnings. This valuation gap can be justified on different counts, but Siyaram&rsquo;s profile, too, is improving. Better return ratios, marginal debt, comparable operating margins and positive annual cash flows to name a few. The valuation gap should, over a period of time, capture these positives and start reflecting in its share price.&nbsp;</p>', 'Siyaram is riding the momentum in viscose-based fabrics and its branded garments business', '8', '', 0, '', 'coming-home-to-57', 52, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Coming home to...', 'Siyaram is riding the momentum in viscose-based fabrics and its branded garments business', '', '', '', 'Siyaram,Ramesh Poddar,Viscose-based fabrics', 0, NULL, '2015-01-06 19:23:18', '2015-01-14 15:26:47', '2014-10-17', 0);

The now 59-year-old Nayak, who is the COO and executive director of pharma major Zydus Cadila, was 25 when he visited a shooting range in Mangalore and shot his first firearm, all thanks to a friend who worked in the Karnataka police department. Seventeen years later, Nayak purchased his very first gun, a Smith &amp; Wesson .32 calibre revolver. Today, Nayak owns three firearms &mdash; a Winchester rifle, a revolver and a BA Jonas bolt action shotgun &mdash; and spends several hours every Sunday brushing up his shooting skills at the Ahmedabad rifle club. The Ahmedabad-based pharma veteran has also been hooked on to clay pigeon shooting ever since he first tried it on a business trip to the US. Now, each time Nayak travels to the US, he makes sure he completes a few rounds at a range in New Hampshire along with his son, Narain, who has also developed a liking for the sport.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Shooting demands focus and sharp thinking, the same qualities that are required for success in the business sphere, where you need to direct your energies towards achieving your target. The sport enhances your ability to concentrate on your goal, which improves your chances of success,&rdquo; says Nayak. He believes that this interest has helped him gain the determination required to climb up the corporate ladder as he went from being a medical sales representative in 1977 to the president of his organisation in 1995.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Nayak&rsquo;s commitment to his passion has also led to some valuable insights. &ldquo;In skeet shooting, you have to wait for the right opportunity to strike down your target. This level of alertness helps during business deals as well, as you have to be quick to spot lucrative opportunities.&rdquo; This lesson came in handy for Nayak in 2009, when he first read about the swine flu epidemic and how another pharma company was working on a vaccine against the H1N1 virus. &ldquo;That made me wonder why we hadn&rsquo;t taken up this opportunity. We already had a dedicated vaccine centre and a team of expert scientists, so it was not like the cure was beyond our reach.&rdquo; That bit of prompt thinking resulted in Zydus Cadila developing India&rsquo;s first H1N1 vaccine.</p>\n<p class="p3">Apart from skeet and clay pigeon shooting, Nayak unwinds through a few laps around the neighbourhood on his luxury bikes. &ldquo;At the end of a busy day, my way of unwinding doesn&rsquo;t involve attending parties.

(60, 24, '', 'Home is where the ramp is', '<p class="p1">A designer home is a notional term. Does it imply a house styled by a designer or a home replete with designer accouterments? Or, does luxury imply designer creations? With luxury homes becoming the norm in big cities &mdash; the Lodha and Trump towers in Mumbai, DLF&rsquo;s Magnolia, Aralias and, now, Camellias in Gurgaon &mdash; homeowner aspirations are constantly on the rise. The Lodhas&rsquo; World One boasts of Versace interiors inside what is being touted as the world&rsquo;s tallest residential tower in Mumbai; Tarun Tahiliani has designed villas in Goa; architect Mohit Gujral&rsquo;s project in Kasauli features premium cottages; and, of course, homeowners appoint the best-known or, at least, celebrity interior specialists in India (Suzanne Roshan, Raseel Gujral, Gauri Khan) and overseas to fit out the home of their dreams. Even Sabyasachi has designed interiors &mdash; for a hotel suite in London &mdash; while other renowned fashion designers have offered their inputs to furniture and interior projects on a selective basis.</p>\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;Riding on the back of this trend, a Gurgaon residential tower has brought on board four fashion designers to design all its apartments and public areas, making it India&rsquo;s first fully designer-appointed project in the country. Labelled Cattaro, the 24-storeyed tower owned by Advance India Projects Limited (AIPL) has 84 boutique apartments featuring interiors styled by four marquee names from Indian fashion: Tarun Tahiliani, JJ Valaya, Abu Jani-Sandeep Khosla, and Shantanu &amp; Nikhil. These designers all have varied aesthetic sensibilities, so getting them on the same platform could hardly have been easy for the promoters. And it&rsquo;s got potential buyers talking, too, for interior design, like fashion, is subjective. Tahiliani has been tasked with designing the project&rsquo;s public spaces, which include a sky lounge, business centre, a caf&eacute;, a clubhouse and fitness centre, salon, spa and swimming pool, and the entrance lobby and porch, while the other three teams will work on the interiors of the #4.5 crore-5.5-crore residences.</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421231447.jpg" alt="img1" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p2">Sanjay Sachdeva, executive director, AIPL, sought to decipher the relationship between design, designers and luxury, especially in the context of spaces. &ldquo;Across industries, luxury has been defined by design; it plays a very obvious role in giving the product and its consumer a visible personality,&rdquo; he says. Naturally, its reflection in living spaces, where consumers of luxury products put their feet up, &ldquo;has fast caught up in India, where the passion for fine living and appreciation for art and architecture now go hand-in-hand&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In the West too, fashion houses have a history of extending themselves to create furniture and furnishings, and offer bespoke design services. While there are obvious synergies between fashion and interiors, the result can often be overwhelming. The Cattaro team worked around this issue by offering the designers a clean slate on which to experiment within the larger context of visualising a space for contemporary India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Sachdeva talks of these apartments as &lsquo;trophy assets&rsquo;, though they are clearly more than that &mdash; a home evoking an emotional response in the Indian mind. If anything, the group has conceived of the apartments as a couture offering rather than a pr&ecirc;t one, with eight duplex apartments and three- or four-bedroom residences set within a landscape of gardens and driveways with fountains and sculptures. The designers will ensure that each apartment is fully finished, though some aspects &mdash; such as soft furnishings and some appointments &mdash; can be customised to individual requirements.

(61, 24, '', 'Want more, give less', '<p class="p1">Hanover Street connects downtown Boston to the historic North End, running straight through the heart of Paul Revere&rsquo;s old neighborhood. On a warm sunny day, it seems like half of New England is here soaking up the history and enjoying the atmosphere. Along Hanover Street are numerous wonderful pastry shop known for their cannoli, a Sicilian treat made of a tube of fried pastry dough filled with a creamy ricotta cheese-based filling. You can get cannoli at nearly every pastry shop in the North End, but if you want cannoli from Mike&rsquo;s Pastry, you&rsquo;ll need to wait in line. I&rsquo;ve done so many times, and I&rsquo;ve never regretted it.</p>\n<p class="p3">Yet many locals will tell you with good authority that the cannoli down the street at Modern Pastry is just as good, and maybe better some say. Nearby Cafe Graffiti will sell you a cannoli that&rsquo;s just as good. And some say Cafe Vittoria makes a cannoli that&rsquo;s even better, and they serve it to you in a nicer environment. As the line gets longer at Mike&rsquo;s Pastry, the other pastry shop other pastry shop owners stand and watch in wonder.</p>\n<p class="p3">There&rsquo;s no doubt that nothing creates demand like a line of customers waiting outside your store. A line not only tells potential customers that something inside is worth waiting for, but it also sends a message of urgency. If you want <em>this</em> cannoli, you better get in line now because if you don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;ll all be gone. That&rsquo;s the message the line at Mike&rsquo;s Pastry sends. The line creates the perception of scarcity. It is a powerful formula for brands to remember:&nbsp; if a brand is in demand and people believe it&rsquo;s in short supply, the value of the brand increases exponentially. If Mike&rsquo;s Pastry had twenty locations around metro Boston, the line on Hanover Street wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly as long because the product wouldn&rsquo;t be perceived as scarce. As it stands, you can only get a cannoli from Mike&rsquo;s Pastry at their single location at 300 Hanover Street.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Create demand. Create the perception (or reality) that your product or service is rare. Watch value increase. In 2006 and 2007, finding a Wii console around Christmastime was nearly impossible. When stores were rumored to be getting a shipment, the line would form days in advance. People were literally camping outside electronic stores waiting for the chance to buy a Nintendo Wii! Even into 2008, two years after they debuted, the Wiis were selling as fast as retailers could order them. The Wii has become the bestselling video game system of its generation, having shipped more than 70 million consoles worldwide. While buying one today is as easy as walking into a neighborhood electronics store, in the first two years after launching, it seemed impossible to find one. Despite producing 1.8 million units each month, demand consistently outstripped supply all over the world.</p>\n<p class="p3">Could Nintendo have physically made more Wii consoles? Of course they physically <em>could</em> have, but it wouldn&rsquo;t have made financial sense despite the fact that they would have sold more units and made more money in the short term. By always keeping supply lower than demand, Nintendo created urgency and excitement over the Wii. That urgency was a key factor in allowing Nintendo to wait three years before finally lowering the retail price of a Wii console. If you have a product in demand and short supply, you can command a much higher price.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Insights</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Accessing success</strong></span></p>\n<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421232443.jpg" alt="graphic 1" width="850" height="580" /></strong></span></p>\n<p class="p1">Authors <strong>Rajiv Dehejia</strong> and <strong>Nandini Gupta</strong> discovered that despite theory suggesting that capital markets affect entrepreneurship and financial market development is associated with an increase in self-employment, there seems to be an opposite effect in India.

They also found that there is greater access to credit from formal institutions when there is a decrease in household employment or an increase in formal employment and wages.

The belief that nobody could help them out of the debt cycle was deep-set, motivating Lee to set up Krishi Star in August 2013. &ldquo;Our goal is to ensure farmers own a greater part of the supply chain,&rdquo; says Lee.

Available in 3-kg cans costing Rs 250, the tomatoes are hot property at eateries such as Pali Village Caf&eacute; and Caf&eacute; Zoe. While restaurants place orders for 270 kg during the festival season, leading hotels order 900 kg every alternate month.

(64, 12, '', 'Growth in transit', '<p class="p1">When you finally receive the tightly-wrapped package at your doorstep, it&rsquo;s hard to pay close attention to who delivered it, isn&rsquo;t it? Sure, you may have been directed to a delivery company&rsquo;s website while tracking your order, but that&rsquo;s about it. For e-retailers, though, this backend function is assuming greater importance. According to a study by Assocham and PwC, the $13-billion e-commerce business in India is expected to spend $1 billion by 2020 on infrastructure, logistics and warehousing. &ldquo;Total spend on warehousing and sortation centres could be as high as 3-6% of topline revenue, which represents a cumulative spend of over $900 million till 2020,&rdquo; the report adds, noting that logistics &ldquo;may act as the biggest barrier to the growth of the e-commerce industry&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">E-retailers are working overtime to ensure that doesn&rsquo;t happen. Where larger companies such as Flipkart and Amazon have set up their own logistics arms to ensure greater control over the supply chain, others have opted for tie-ups with big logistics companies and even the state-owned India Post.</p>\n<p class="p3">Certainly, the logistics big guns in India have understood the potential of this business. Blue Dart, Gati, DTDC, First Flight and even India Post have their own exclusive services to deal with e-commerce deliveries. While Deutsche Post DHL has just announced its decision to invest &euro;100 million (Rs 800 crore) through its subsidiary Blue Dart over the next two years to create e-commerce infrastructure in India, DTDC&rsquo;s dedicated service, DotZot, is aiming for a Rs 100-crore plus turnover by FY16. &ldquo;There is huge potential in e-commerce. It has very distinct needs &mdash; such as cash on delivery and return policies &mdash; that need a dedicated approach,&rdquo; says DotZot co-founder and CEO Sanjay Kathuria. Set up in March 2013, DotZot covers over 8,000 pin codes in 2,300 cities in India, focusing exclusively on the e-retail space, and has all major e-commerce companies in its kitty.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"E-commerce has very distinct needs that need a dedicated approach" - Sanjay Kathuria, COO and co-founder, DotZot</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">With new e-tailers springing up every day, there&rsquo;s also a ready market seeking affordable delivery solutions. Several third-party logistics (3PL) players have set up shop to make the most of this opportunity, and investors are also tuning in. Delhi-based logistics company Delhivery got equity funding from Times Internet (Rs 6.6 crore) and Nexus Venture Partners (#35 crore) and is believed to have received a third round of investment recently from Renuka Ramnath&rsquo;s Multiple Alternate Asset Management. Started in 2011, the company clocked revenue of Rs 60 crore in FY14 and hopes to cross Rs 220 crore by FY15. &ldquo;In three years, we have become the largest company in the e-commerce fulfilment and logistics space and handle over 65,000 transactions a day across 180 cities for 25,000 merchants and more than 800 e-commerce companies,&rdquo; says Sahil Barua, co-founder and CEO, Delhivery.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>More in store- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Another Delhi-based player, Holisol, recently received venture capital funding of $1.5 million, from Datavision CEO Sundeep Bhandari. Started in 2009, Holisol depends on e-commerce for 60% of its volume: clients include Jabong, Fabfurnish, Officeyes, Amway, Tupperware and Samsung&rsquo;s e-store. The Rs 25-crore company made Rs 1 crore net profit in FY14 and hopes to get to Rs 40 crore in revenue this year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The heightened interest in the 3PL sector is not new, but e-commerce-related 3PL has been on the radar only recently. Says Manish Saigal, MD, Alvarez &amp; Marsal, a business management advisory firm, &ldquo;There is excitement because of e-commerce volumes growing at 30-40% annually, translating into business opportunity for logistics companies. While the business is currently centred on tier 1 cities, tier 2 and 3 cities are bound to take over in the next five years.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;E<strong>arly days</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Like all Next Big Things, 3PL is also prone to hype. E-commerce logistics player Chhotu, started in 2011, shut shop last year. The Delhi-based start-up had operations in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and parts of Punjab and offered warehouse and packaging services to e-retailers. It had raised $500,000 in angel investing and closed down after failing to get further funding. &ldquo;It is challenging for standalone players to survive in the booming market. Players should be able to spread costs and make money to be able to scale,&rdquo; says Saigal.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Players should be able to spread costs and scale to keep up with competition" - Manish Saigal, MD, Alvarez and Marsal India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s not the only challenge &mdash; logistics requires high capital investment to set up fulfilment and sorting centres, warehouses and a large network to ensure smooth delivery. Then, there are multiple pick-up points in online purchases &mdash; multiple sellers for larger e-commerce traders and product returns from customers &mdash; that are managed through the same network. Also, in India, 50-60% of the shipment volume is paid for by cash-on-delivery, which brings up issues of cash management and security.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">If that&rsquo;s not bad enough, states such as West Bengal and Kerala have now imposed entry taxes on online purchases, impacting deliveries to these areas.

(65, 12, '', 'Step in the right direction', '<p class="p1">It is being touted as the next big thing in wearable technology and the best part is, it is of Indian provenance. After smart glasses and smart watches, it is time to welcome smart shoes into our lives. Though Google Glass may still be out of reach for those of us in India, we can definitely get our hands on the smart shoes made by Secunderabad-based company Ducere Technologies. Called Lechal (which means &lsquo;take me along&rsquo; in Hindi), these shoes sync with smartphones through an app to provide users with a variety of information &mdash; from directions to your destination to the number of calories you have burnt. The app helps the shoes connect to the GPS-based app Google Maps, and directions are thereby relayed to the user through vibrations in either the left or right shoe. The app can keep track of your fitness targets, the distance you cover and routes you travel frequently.</p>\n<p class="p3">It all started in 2011, when MIT and University of Michigan graduates Anirudh Sharma and Krispian Lawrence met through a common friend. &ldquo;We both love tinkering and playing with technology and building products,&rdquo; says Lawrence, CEO and co-founder, Ducere Technologies. When their pet project of a haptic feedback-based shoe began taking shape for real, both Lawrence and Sharma quit their jobs to start Ducere Technologies as a two-person company in an apartment in Secunderabad. &ldquo;I was working in the US as a patent lawyer and Anirudh was working at HP Labs in Bengaluru at the time. I convinced him to quit his job and start the company with me,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">The initial drafts of the product were meant to address accessibility problems faced by the visually challenged. While canes help them identify obstacles, they can&rsquo;t help the visually challenged with navigation; and other devices that assist them rely on audio feedback, which can be difficult to follow in noisy and congested areas. The Lechal shoe works on the concept of haptic feedback, which means that it provides directions through vibrations, whose intensity can be customised to indicate an upcoming turn, whether it is 500 metres or 50 metres away. But once they started testing the product and its range of applications, the duo realised it could have a wider appeal. &ldquo;While it was initially designed to assist the visually challenged, we realised that since there were many navigation and fitness applications in the market, we could position it as a lifestyle product as well,&rdquo; says Lawrence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Walk this way</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Lechal offers two main products &mdash; a complete set of shoes and just the Lechal insoles, which can fit into any normal pair of shoes. &ldquo;We are not pricing the two products any differently. It depends on the user, he can either buy the shoe or opt for the insoles,&rdquo; says Lawrence. Here&rsquo;s how it works. Removable sensors &mdash; powered by two rechargeable lithium batteries &mdash; inside the insoles respond to gestures such as a tap of the toes to help you record a landmark and a snap of fingers to know the power status of your charger. The shoes are also built to withstand rain. The mobile application that the sensors sync with is compatible with iOS, Android and Windows smartphones. Currently, the shoes are designed in India and manufactured in China. &ldquo;Once we reach a certain scale, we could bring production back to India but until then, China remains our only viable option,&rdquo; says Lawrence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Go that extra mile - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Individual vendors supply the different components that go into each shoe, with the final product getting assembled at multiple factories in China. Though Lawrence used his experience as a patent lawyer to get 24 international and Indian patents for Lechal, the founders realise copies may be inevitable. &ldquo;Once the product is out, it will only take about eight months for someone in China to replicate it. But we believe that we have the first-mover advantage and bad copies will only make our product look a lot better,&rdquo; he adds. Besides, Ducere is currently in the process of setting up online and phone tech support, in addition to the standard guarantee offered with the shoes.</p>\n<p class="p3">The sports shoes and insoles on offer &mdash; available in both black and red &mdash; are likely to be priced at Rs 6,000 in India and between $100 and $150 in overseas markets Though the shoes go on sale in stores in major metros from September, they can be pre-ordered through the company&rsquo;s website. Ducere is in talks with retailers and distributors to expand its footprint within India and abroad. According to Lawrence, the shoes have generated much interest across the world, particularly in Japan, the US, the UK and Europe, and the company has already received orders for 25,000 pairs. Lawrence is confident that Ducere will be able to sell 100,000 pairs by March 2015. &ldquo;Though we have not rolled out a direct marketing campaign, we have received a lot of interest solely on the basis of word of mouth,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Helping hand</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Ducere is tying up with non-profit organisations and eye institutes in the UK, the US, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa to sell the shoes at affordable prices. In India, the company has tied up with the LV Prasad Eye Institute to ensure that its products reach more visually challenged people. The institute&rsquo;s principal investigator, Dr Anthony Vipin Das, is working on a study to test Lechal&rsquo;s effectiveness as an assistive device. &ldquo;Lechal has been a life-changing experience for patients who have tried it and the best thing about the product is that it is non-intrusive and vastly improves the direction orientation of the patients,&rdquo; Das says.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Lechal is a life-chaning experience for patients and being non-intrusive, improves direction orientation" - Dr Anthony Vipin Das, Principal investigator, LV Prasad Eye Institute</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">According to him, while the cane can never be replaced as it is used for the identification of the visually challenged and immediate obstacles, the shoes could act as a perfect match for the cane.Right now, the company is providing a subsidy of 30-50% on the shoes it is selling to the institute. &ldquo;As we scale up, we hope to increase that subsidy further. The ultimate vision is to provide the shoes to the visually challenged at $1,&rdquo; says Lawrence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>The right fit</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">So, how does Lechal compare with other wearable tech gadgets? For starters, motion trackers such as Fitbit and Jawbone are focused on health and fitness and do not provide navigation. Then, not everyone is comfortable with the Google Glass as it is quite noticeable and might not get accepted into mainstream usage. &ldquo;Lechal is the most non-intrusive way of incorporating wearable technology into our lives. No one will even know that you are using it,&rdquo; says Lawrence. Since it works on haptic feedback, you don&rsquo;t have to keep looking at a screen for directions, as you would have to with a smartphone. And since the technology is built into a shoe, it is unlikely that you would ever leave home without it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While Google Maps works like a dream in developed countries, how will the technology keep track of the navigation challenges in India, where there are numerous alleys, unnamed streets and sudden route changes on the way?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;There are definite challenges but Google Maps has vastly improved between 2012 and 2014 and things will only get better from here on. However, we have made several provisions for the developing landscape. If there is a particular <em>gully</em> you regularly take, you can make the shoes map the route and also tag any speed breakers or potholes that you might face so that it gives you an indication the next time around. These are small chinks that can be ironed out over time,&rdquo; says Lawrence.</p>\n<p class="p3">Ducere has raised $2 million from angel investors so far and is looking to raise $4-5 million to market its products. While Lawrence declined to discuss products the company is set to roll out in future, he admitted that they will be even more efficient and will still be based on wearable technology. &ldquo;It took us three years to take our product from concept to production. However, our learning curve for other products will definitely be faster, given our experience with the shoes. We now also have a good set of vendors who we can source from,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Ducere has its sights set on the wearable tech market in India. &ldquo;With 55% of our population under the age of 35, there is huge potential for wearable tech. The right time to be in any market is before the explosion and we pride ourselves on being the first Indian company in this space,&rdquo; says Lawrence. Currently, wearable tech is the buzzword not just in India, but across the world.

(66, 12, '', 'The perfect script', '<p class="p1">If social networking is synonymous with Facebook, online shopping with Amazon, then show tickets and entertainment are definitely instantly associated with Bookmyshow, at least in India. In just over a decade, the e-ticketing company has stolen the show with its innovative digital business model, providing moviegoers a hassle-free ticketing option and arming multiplex theatres with higher revenue and footfalls. And all this despite huge external troubles such as the dotcom bust and global sub-prime crisis. From nothing, Bookmyshow has gone on to become a Rs 100-crore player with a decisive 80% share in the online movie ticket booking space. Growing at 100% and having turned profitable two years ago, the company has around 400 employees working across major cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad.</p>\n<p class="p3">So, it is not surprising that it has managed to raise Rs 250 crore since 2007 from eager investors, including Reliance-owned Network 18, Accel India and Saif Partners. The latest round of equity infusion by Saif Partners has now valued Bookmyshow at Rs 1,100 crore. At present, Network 18 holds 40% in parent company Bigtree Entertainment, making <span class="s3">it the largest shareholder in the company. The promoters hold 30%, and the rest is split between Accel India and Saif Partners.</span></p>\n<p class="p4">While the Rs 10,000-crore box-office ticketing market is growing at anywhere between 10% and 50%, Bookmyshow is expanding into new categories such as theatre and events like sports. The potential, then, seems enormous, but is the picture as rosy as it seems?</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>The early days</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">In 1999, Ashish Hemrajani was on a backpacking trip in South Africa, taking a break from his two-year-old job at ad agency J Walter Thompson. Travelling around Storms River Valley, he was sitting under a tree, listening to the radio, when it played a jingle promoting tickets for a rugby match.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Hemrajani was struck by the idea of a virtual ticketing business and, returning to India soon after, the 24-year-old quit his job, persuaded his friends Rajesh Balpande and Parikshit Dar to quit their jobs as well and started a movie ticket selling business through telephone and the internet. The name of their company &mdash; Bigtree Entertainment &mdash; pays tribute to the site of Hemrajani&rsquo;s epiphany.</p>\n<p class="p4">Why cinema tickets? Is Hemrajani a movie buff? &ldquo;Not really. In my life, I haven&rsquo;t seen more than 20 movies,&rdquo; says the 39-year-old. Indeed, Hemrajani is decidedly an outdoors man, and likes to sail and swim in his spare time. A member of the Colaba Sailing Club and Royal Bombay Yacht Club, he&rsquo;s currently planning to buy a 35-seat sloop cruiser, his first boat, to make his weekend sailing trips even more meaningful.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">What triggered the thought behind Bookmyshow, then, was &ldquo;an instinct for creating solutions to people&rsquo;s problems, making an incremental difference to their lives&rdquo;. Growing up in a middle-class household in Mumbai, he says, he observed how people around him struggled to fulfil even their basic needs, standing in queues for hours to buy staples, movie or train tickets. &ldquo;It was this feeling of inadequacy that got me going,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Taking the plunge, though, wasn&rsquo;t easy for the three founders. Balpande, for instance, was comfortably placed at the Chatterjee-Soros group when he quit to join his MBA classmates from Syndenham College in their new business initiative. &ldquo;Coming from a fairly modest, conservative background, it was a difficult decision. Around 2002, we would only get paid when there was business and that was tough since both Parikshit [Dar] and I had just gotten married. But still, we were firm in our resolve and conviction,&rdquo; says Balpande. Dar, who quit his job as an IT manager with the Star supermarket chain in South Africa to set up Bigtree, concurs, &ldquo;We were very, very early in the business. Establishing the concept in India was no child&rsquo;s play.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>"Around 2002, we would only get paid when there was business and what was tough" - Rajesh Balpande, co-founder, Bookmyshow</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">With seed capital of Rs 25,000 from Hemrajani and his friends, Bigtree Entertainment came to life in 1999 &mdash; and very shortly after, Chase Capital Partners JP Morgan bought a stake. Armed with capital, the founders went about not just building the business, but creating the entire ecosystem of online ticketing. Remember, this was a time when not only was internet penetration minuscule, the concept of multiplexes, too, was practically absent. Bigtree had to introduce cinema houses to technology that would allow them to sell tickets online as well as at the box office.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Bigtree tied up with New Zealand-based Vista Entertainment Solutions for the ticketing software and customised it to suit local conditions. Initially, the company installed the software for free at theatres but, realising that theatre-owners weren&rsquo;t really valuing what Bigtree was bringing to the table, soon started charging for the installation. Even now, the software solution accounts for 5% of their revenues.</p>\n<p class="p4">After tie-ups with 200 cinema houses, Bigtree launched its service in 2000 as IndyaTickets.com. But the dotcom bust in 2001-2002 put the business model under tremendous pressure, even as Chase Capital exited by selling its stake to NewsCorp. At the time, Bigtree&rsquo;s arrangement with theatres involved buying a fixed amount of inventory and selling that to customers &mdash; often, it ended up with unsold tickets on weekdays while running short on weekends. This, coupled with its 15 call centres and 150 employees, including staff to hand over tickets on cash-on-delivery (COD) basis, meant costs became unwieldy. The company quickly restructured the organisation, shifting offices and cutting costs to stay afloat; headcount came down to just six. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t easy in those days. I kept getting calls from headhunters about jobs but I clung on to our company steadfastly,&rdquo; recalls Hemrajani.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Between 2002 and 2006, Hemrajani ran the company as a B2B service, providing ticketing software to the mushrooming multiplex sector. It turned into a call centre for multiplexes such as PVR and Cinemax, among others, and had around 60 employees. The inflection point, though, came in 2007.</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>Fresh impetus</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">Greenshoots became visible at Bigtree in 2007 when Network 18 invested around Rs 35 crore in the company. Sarbvir Singh, managing director, Capital 18, which handles the media and entertainment investments for Network18, says the group believed in the potential of Bigtree. &ldquo;We spotted the talent and ambition of the trio early on. They are a grounded lot who have seen failures but still managed to stay focused,&rdquo; said Singh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>"They [Bookmyshow] are a grounded lot who have seen failures but still managed to stay focused" - Sarbvir Singh, managing director, Capital 18</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">The fresh investment aside, the external environment was also much more promising now. Mobile telephony had exploded across India and internet banking was gaining ground. Accordingly, Bigtree changed its business model. Rechristened Bookmyshow, now the service involved entering into a convenience fee arrangement with multiplexes and standalone cinema houses; buying bulk inventory and COD came to an end and all customer transactions moved online.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">The next hurdle appeared quickly. Like everyone else, Bookmyshow, too, suffered the consequences of the global financial meltdown. Apart from that, there was also a strike in the Hindi film industry then and &ldquo;all kinds of mayhem that could unsettle a businessman&rdquo;, says Hemrajani, adding, &ldquo;But we had learnt our lesson from 2002.&rdquo; Cost-cutting measures were immediately implemented &mdash; minimum, lowest-cost travel, cutting down on stationery and electricity, etc. Around 80 employees also collectively decided on salary cuts of 10-30% across the board.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">The measures helped and Bigtree turned the corner in 2011, when it became Ebitda positive. The following year, Accel India contributed to the second round of fund infusion, investing Rs 100 crore, even as Bigtree expanded to 150 cities. In 2013, in a bid to widen its coverage, Bigtree acquired the Chennai-based Ticketgreen.com, the flagship brand of Ticketgreen Solutions, a leading entertainment ticketing portal in the south. Around the same time, the company also moved beyond cinema to offer tickets to events such as concerts and theatres as well as sports such as IPL matches and F1 racing. Currently, 30% of Bigtree&rsquo;s revenue comes from non-movie tickets.</p>\n<p class="p4">The same year, Hemrajani and his partners got a third round of fund infusion when Saif Partners put in Rs 150 crore into the company. Deepak Gaur, managing director, Saif Partners, says, &ldquo;Entertainment events is a fast growing market in India. Internet penetration is also growing fast in the country. Ashish and his team have a genuine passion for their business. Their main differentiator is the ability to create end-to-end solutions for offline events. They managed to develop a customer-friendly solution. We might increase our stake in the company as and when the opportunity comes,&rdquo; says Gaur. He declines to share details about Saif Partners&rsquo; stake in the company.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>"Bookmyshow''s main differentiator is the ability o create end-to-end solutions for offline events" - Deepak Gaur, manaing director, Saif Partners</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that we desperately needed funding,&rdquo; adds Hemrajani. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that we needed a player such as Saif Partners, who understands the value of scaling up an organisation. Also, Saif has helped other online companies such as Justdial and MakeMyTrip, which it invested into, go public in a short time,&rdquo; said Hemrajani. While MakeMyTrip got listed on the Nasdaq in 2010, Justdial recently got listed on the NSE.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Staying the course</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">For now, the company has big growth plans for the next few years. &ldquo;Our focus will remain on innovation and people. We will also work on new ticketing formats &mdash; we are trying to deploy new technologies to make the transactions smoother and more seamless,&rdquo; says Hemrajani. Last year, the company launched the Bookmyshow mobile app, which has been very successful &mdash; already, 40% of tickets are booked through the app. &ldquo;We are also investing heavily into some of our product lines, such as the automated ticketing machine, and looking at cloud-based solutions to make the check-out process and ticket collection much easier,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p4">As a pilot, Bigtree has set up automated ticket collecting machines at select cinema houses. Customers simply place their debit or credit cards on the machine, which scans the card and prints the ticket, similar to self check-in kiosks at airports. &ldquo;From an operational level, there should not be any queues at the counters, where people have to stand to collect their tickets,&rdquo; Hemrajani explains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Bigtree also plans to expand into tier 2 and tier 3 cities, going forward, from its current focus on metros. &ldquo;The growth potential from smaller towns is very good because of&nbsp;mobile phones,&rdquo; says Hemrajani. Currently, Bookmyshow does almost 40% of its transactions on mobile. Its target for FY15: selling 50 million tickets across all mediums.</p>\n<p class="p4">Hemrajani explains that it was not too difficult persuading theatre owners to join hands with Bookmyshow. &ldquo;Once they saw the kind of enthusiasm we had and the kind of work we were doing with our market partners, they readily accepted us as we had the same objective,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p4">As on date, around 80% of Bookmyshow&rsquo;s business comes from movie tickets, while the rest comes from events such as music festivals, Formula One races, concerts and IPL, among others. Its main sources of revenue (85%) comes from the convenience fee charged on each ticket; the sale of ticketing software, including maintenance fees, to multiplex theatres brings in 5%, and turnkey solutions for events and sports such as IPL contributes to around 10% of revenue. While Bookmyshow sells software to around 50% of its 3,000 screens clients, it hopes to add 5,000-6,000 screen clients over the next two years. Going forward, it is also looking at targeted advertising for production houses and conversion of tickets from cash to credit card as other sources of revenue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">At present, Bookmyshow covers 3,000 screens across 200 cities, with the southern market contributing to 30% of revenues as the region has many more releases compared with the north and the west, which add an equal 25% share to revenues. With most multiplexes increasing their footprint and 10,000 screens likely to be added across India in the next five years, there is enough growth potential for Bookmyshow. &ldquo;We have been Ebitda and PAT positive for two years now. We have seen around 100% growth in the last one year,&rdquo; points out Hemrajani. Though the company refused to share financials, data sourced from the registrar of companies shows Bigtree Entertainment clocked revenue of around Rs 53 crore in FY13 against Rs 29 crore the previous year. Similarly, profit after tax in FY13 was Rs 3.2 crore against Rs 1.4 crore in FY12.</p>\n<p class="p4">While the convenience fee arrangement seems to be a big part of revenue, the arrangement does not necessarily mean Bookmyshow&rsquo;s business model is risk-free. For instance, after the Maharashtra government chose to scrap the convenience fee in 2013, in the last one year, Bigtree suffered a revenue loss of Rs 10 crore. That number will get reflected in the FY14 numbers, which the company has not yet revealed. The Bombay high court has since stayed the ban, but the fact remains that regulation changes can easily impact Bookmyshow&rsquo;s core business. However, Hemrajani is not unduly worried. &ldquo;I believe consumers pay money if they see value in the service being provided and had that not been the case, Bookmyshow would not be in business.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">Despite the challenges, existing investors don&rsquo;t seem to be worried. In fact, Saif Partner&rsquo;s fund infusion has now valued Bookmyshow startlingly high for a company with revenue well under Rs 100 crore. Girish Nadkarni, partner, IDFC Alternatives-Private Equity, believes that the online space is now the flavour of the season for investors. &ldquo;Increasingly, private equity players and investors are investing into online businesses, which are abuzz with stories of potential growth.&rdquo; But Jaideep Ghosh, partner, KPMG believes valuations here are getting into bubble territory. &ldquo;One cause of concern is that the club of highly valued online firms is only swelling with players such as Flipkart and Bookmyshow. While some are real, some are stretching out too thin and may find it hard to survive,&rdquo; he points out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Gaur of Saif Partners, though, believes valuations are a function of comparables and growth potential for online businesses. &ldquo;We analysed the financials of Bookmyshow, compared those with other online firms, weighed the growth potential and then decided to invest into the company.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">Not surprisingly, such an approach has seen investors in Bigtree Entertainment ready to pay a premium. In 2012, Network18 made a profit of Rs 45 crore by selling its 20% stake to Accel India, which has thus far invested Rs 100 crore in Bigtree. Globally, Accel has invested successfully in online companies such as Facebook, Rovio and Groupon, among others. In India, too, it has invested in growing internet businesses such as Flipkart and Myntra.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>"Bookmyshow has added significant value since we invested into the company. It is speeding ahead" - Prashanth Prakash, Partner, Accel India</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">For now, the private equity players are keeping their faith. &ldquo;Bookmyshow has added significant value since we invested into the company. It is speeding ahead,&rdquo; feels Prashanth Prakash, partner, Accel India. Saif Partners, too, believes the best is yet to come. &ldquo;We have an investment horizon of around five-seven years and believe Bookmyshow enjoys a dominant position in a growing market,&rdquo; adds Gaur. For Hemrajani &amp; co, who have come back from the brink, that vote of confidence is what will keep them going. &nbsp;</p>', 'Bookmyshow is now the cynosure of PE funds, but can the online ticketing major live up to the hype of its Rs 1,100-crore valuation?', '10', '', 0, '', 'the-perfect-script-66', 61, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'The perfect script', 'Bookmyshow is now the cynosure of PE funds, but can the online ticketing major live up to the hype of its Rs 1,100-crore valuation?', '', '', '', 'Bookmyshow,Accel India,Saif Partners,Ashish Hemrajani', 0, NULL, '2015-01-13 12:24:23', '2015-01-14 11:57:32', '2014-09-19', 0),
(67, 20, '', 'Have cash, will hoard', '<p class="p1">The irony is stark. Warren Buffett is a vocal advocate of investing in companies that pay dividends. Be it IBM, Coca-Cola, American Express or Wells Fargo, Procter &amp; Gamble, Walmart or ExxonMobil, Berkshire Hathaway&rsquo;s favourite investments all pay dividends regularly. But Berkshire itself hasn&rsquo;t paid out a cent in dividend since 1967. That year, it paid 10 cents a share and the Oracle of Omaha insists, even now, that he must have been in the bathroom when that decision was approved. Investors aren&rsquo;t all that pleased with Buffett&rsquo;s stand &mdash; in March this year, shareholder David Witt proposed that Berkshire use some of its $48.2 billion cash towards giving dividends. &ldquo;Whereas the corporation has more money than it needs and since the owners, unlike Warren, are not multi-billionaires, the board shall consider paying a meaningful annual dividend on the shares,&rdquo; Witt&rsquo;s proposal states. Incidentally, referring to shareholders as owners is classic Buffett terminology.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The proposal was defeated in the May 3 Berkshire shareholders&rsquo; annual meeting &mdash; not surprising, really, given that Berkshire holds a third of voting rights and Buffett has explained his standpoint on dividends quite clearly in the past. In his 2012 letter to shareholders, Buffett addressed the issue of cash utilisation and dividend; he explained that what seems to be the best strategy &mdash; paying money back to shareholders in the form of dividends &mdash; may not be the best one for investors, considering the other ways of creating value for shareholders. &ldquo;A profitable company can allocate its earnings in various ways (which are not mutually exclusive). A company&rsquo;s management should first examine reinvestment possibilities offered by its current business &mdash; projects to become more efficient, expand territorially, extend and improve product lines or to otherwise widen the economic moat separating the company from its competitors.&rdquo; The second step, he said, &ldquo;is to search for acquisitions unrelated to our current businesses. Here, our test is simple: Do Charlie [Munger] and I think we can effect a transaction that is likely to leave our shareholders wealthier on a per-share basis than they were prior to the acquisition? The third use of funds &mdash; repurchases &mdash; is sensible for a company when its shares sell at a meaningful discount to conservatively calculated intrinsic value.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s a debate that resonates back home in India as well. In end-July, former Infosys CFOs V Balakrishnan and TV Mohandas Pai wrote a letter to the new management at the IT giant, urging it to use some of its Rs 30,000 crore war chest to buy back shares worth Rs 11,200 crore. The argument: Infosys has never been a generous dividend distributor, nor has it made any aggressive acquisitions. In which case, the money is just lying idle, even as the company&rsquo;s shares are languishing compared with other IT majors. This, then, can be an efficient way of returning shareholders some of their wealth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Meet the hoarders</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Infosys isn&rsquo;t the only company sitting on piles of cash. Research by <em>Outlook Business</em> shows that as on date, 13 such large companies are collectively sitting on Rs 189,307 crore of cash and cash equivalent (adjusted for debt) in their books, which works out to about 68% of their collective net worth. A large part of the equity is deployed in cash and liquid assets, which, one can argue, is hardly the purpose of these businesses. The impact of carrying such large sums of cash is showing up in the return ratios as well. (<em>see: A problem of plenty</em>) Strikingly, a collective return or annual yield on these funds (that is, other income divided by cash and cash equivalent) that are parked in banks and other instruments is about 10.4%, compared with the companies&rsquo; core return on equity (RoE), which is in excess of 45%. This is also a reason why the reported average RoE (or the diluted RoE) of these companies stood at a mere 25%. No wonder, then, that lower return ratios are hammering their valuations. &ldquo;Accumulated cash is impacting their RoE and, thus, valuations. A company with higher RoE will get higher PE and shareholders will get rewarded accordingly,&rdquo; agrees Sunil Singhania, CIO, equity investments, Reliance Mutual Fund.</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421230577.jpg" alt="graphic1" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3">Take a look at how some of the companies on the list have been affected: NMDC reported an RoE of just 24% against the adjusted RoE of 75%. Adjusted RoE takes into account only those profits that are generated by the core business (excluding other income), divided by the equity or net worth (excluding cash and cash equivalent) that is actually employed in the business, assuming that the excess funds are kept in the bank or other instruments and are not deployed in the business. Similarly, state-run coal mining company Coal India is losing big time as it continues to sit on Rs 55,000 crore of cash, which is 129% of its net worth. Though it reported RoE of 33%, if one adjusts the cash, the company is practically equity-free. Similarly, Engineers India, which undertakes engineering work in the hydrocarbons space, recorded a RoE of 20%, but if that figure is adjusted for cash, the company is not using any equity. There is a huge difference in the reported and adjusted RoE of companies such as Bharat Electronics and Max India as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But, quite obviously, cash kept in banks yields only about 8%, hurting the overall return to shareholders. Consider Infosys, which has cash and cash equivalent of Rs 29,000 crore (equal to 67% of its net worth). Thanks to the low yield on the cash on its books, it has reported an RoE of 26%, which is less than half its adjusted RoE of 56%. Similarly, in 2009, about 20% of Ambuja Cement&rsquo;s shareholders&rsquo; funds were deployed in cash and cash equivalent, which currently stands at about 42% of net worth. With a large part of equity parked in bank deposits, RoE has dropped by 600 basis points from about 20% in 2009 to 14% currently.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Compare these companies with TCS, which has paid back a large part of its cash to shareholders, benefiting both its RoE and valuations. In FY14, TCS paid 47% of its available cash in the form of dividends, where Infosys forked out just 12.24%. Accordingly, TCS has an RoE of 44% and an adjusted RoE of 53%.</p>\n<p class="p3">What happens with cash-rich companies, then, is that despite good core RoE, their valuations have been impacted. Typically, markets tend to ascribe higher valuations to companies that earn better return on shareholder funds. For instance, many FMCG companies, such as Nestl&eacute;, HUL and Colgate, return a large chunk of cash generated to shareholders as dividends. That is also a reason why many of these companies have very low equity deployed in the business, and thus generate very high RoE and command very high multiples or trade at higher valuations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The difference is visible. TCS is currently valued at 25 times its trailing earnings, against 19 times for Infosys. Even if part of the valuation gap is explained by higher growth and stable management at the Tata group company, there&rsquo;s no denying that Infosys has been losing valuation premium because of the humongous amount of cash in its books.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Are CFOs stupid?</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">If the point is so crystal clear, why are companies stockpiling cash? Many companies &mdash; especially those in cyclical or less-predictable businesses &mdash; are firm believers in saving for a rainy day. Certainly, in a downturn or an extended bad phase, companies without sufficient reserves can be wiped out. Companies such as Arshiya International, Opto Circuit and Educomp have faced this situation in the past, where this cash crunch led to a big liquidity crisis and they were left unable to even pay salaries. Keeping some cash on hand to cover basic fixed expenses such as interest, salaries and operating expenses can prove a sensible strategy, even if it earns less return.</p>\n<p class="p3">There&rsquo;s another reason behind this hoarding. Nirmal Gangwal, MD, Brescon Corporate Advisors, explains, &ldquo;When the business environment is unstable thanks to government policies or other such issues, many companies end up hoarding cash. Also, many of these companies are looking for opportunities to grow through both organic and inorganic routes and are waiting for the right opportunities to knock on their doors.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s certainly true for companies such as NMDC, Coal India and Bharat Electronics: where NMDC wants to invest in steel capacity as a part of its forward integration, Coal India is looking for overseas mines. Infosys, too, has been scouting for suitable acquisition targets, while Bharat Electronics is planning to expand operations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Anil Singhvi, chairman, Ican Investment Advisors, insists there is nothing wrong with companies hoarding cash, &ldquo;I do not fully subscribe to the idea of giving money back to shareholders &mdash; it would look like the company has run out of ideas. Companies cannot set targets like &lsquo;I have to have an acquisition in the next one year&rsquo;. It doesn&rsquo;t work that way, which is why even if the funds are kept in a bank at 8-9% and you believe that the company is good, you should not bother about the cash.&rdquo; Singhvi himself is a corporate finance veteran who served as CEO of Gujarat Ambuja Cement, the most efficient cement manufacturer in the country before Holcim took it over.</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421230974.jpg" alt="Anil Singhvi" width="850" height="580" />&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Only when a company has run out of ideas will it give back money to shareholders" - Anil Singhvi, chairman, Ican Investment Advisors</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But, ask investors, do acquisitions and expansions really require such huge sums to be kept aside, indefinitely? &ldquo;Even though many of these companies can argue that this cash could be utilised over a period of time for capex and other business-related activities, the accumulated cash in some of the cases is far greater than what could actually be utilised,&rdquo; says Nilesh Shah, MD and CEO, Envision Capital. Investor concern over large sums of money lying unutilised or the lack of clarity on when and for what it is to be used is understandable. Coal India, Engineers India, Cairn India, Hindustan Zinc and several other PSUs are guilty of keeping money idle in banks for long periods. Coal India&rsquo;s cash has grown from Rs 39,000 crore in FY10 to Rs 62,000 crore in FY13, before it was given out through special dividend (129% of face value or utilising about Rs 20,000 crore) in January 2014.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Distributing the spoils</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">So, how can companies create value? Going by Buffett&rsquo;s thinking, if the first two options &mdash; investing in the business and acquiring a company &mdash; have already been explored, the next best thing would be to buy back shares. Certainly, it&rsquo;s an option Berkshire itself has used in 2012, as have companies such as Apple and IBM. &ldquo;If companies are not able to find avenues that can create value for their shareholders, they should return money to the shareholders rather than destroying wealth by parking funds in banks,&rdquo; says Singhania. That&rsquo;s a thought echoed by Shah of Envision Capital. &ldquo;The best way to create value for shareholders in some of these cases would be to use the excessive or surplus cash for buying back shares.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s exactly what Bayer Corp did in October 2013. Selling some of its businesses and a huge land bank in Thane, Maharashtra, yielded the company close to Rs 500 crore. It had also accumulated cash equivalent of about Rs 974 crore, and used a large part of this &mdash; about Rs 490 crore &mdash; to buy back a 7.29% stake in the company, improving its RoE and earnings for existing shareholders.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421230854.jpg" alt="Sunil Singhania" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Return shareholder money instead of destroying wealth by parking funds in banks" - Sunil Singhania, CIO, Reliance Mutual Fund&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Let&rsquo;s illustrate this with a hypothetical case. If a company has earned Rs 100 crore profit and has 100 million shareholders, its earnings per share will accordingly be Rs 10 per share. Now, if the company decides to buy back 20 million shares the same year, the effective earnings per share on the remaining 80 million shares will now be Rs 12.5, which is 25% higher. This way, the company can reduce its number of shares and increase its earnings per share, which will ultimately reflect in higher valuations. As a bonus, if the company is buying back shares at a lower valuation, then existing shareholders can enjoy a higher proportion of growing future earnings and dividends. A rule of thumb is that if the earnings yield (EPS divided by market price) on existing shares is higher than the yield on the bank deposit, any buyback will add more value for existing shareholders. For instance, in the recent past, government-owned utility NHPC, despite having a huge requirement for the funds for its ongoing projects, went on to buy back its shares when the stock was trading at 0.6 times its book value and six to seven times its earnings. At the time, the earnings yield on its shares alone was close to 14-16%, against the 8-9% yield on funds deposited in the banks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Does this apply to PSUs? Market pundits believe that most PSUs that are sitting on huge cash are handicapped as despite having huge cash reserves and their shares trading at low valuations (about a year back), they did not buy back shares. Also, they have suffered in the past for not being able to take active decisions about deploying funds in businesses that are far more robust and earn better RoEs. Besides, the government is the largest stakeholder in most of the PSUs and any buyback will further increase the state&rsquo;s holding. And that&rsquo;s not a desirable outcome at a time when these companies are actually looking to offload the government&rsquo;s stake, following Sebi&rsquo;s new norm regarding minimum public holding.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Keeping tabs</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">So, what should investors be looking for in companies with huge cash reserves? &ldquo;One needs to question whether the company is able to use the surplus cash for growth. In the past, companies like Bajaj have used their cash for building competitive advantage, which is good. Just keep an eye on whether the company is using the surplus cash to expand in unrelated areas, which could pose an even bigger risk,&rdquo; says IV Subramaniam, MD and CIO, Quantum Advisors. Not many company managements are great with acquisitions, and even less have a good track record of getting into new businesses and making a roaring success of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="/public/uploads/editor/2015-01-14/1421231090.jpg" alt="IV Subramaniam" width="850" height="580" /></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"One needs to question whether a company is able to use the surplus cash for growth" - IV Subramaniam, MD and CIO, Quantum Advisors</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Certainly, there are way too many opportunities to let slide. Recently, Vedanta group company Cairn India made headlines when it transferred cash to its parent company Sesa Sterlite as a $1.25-billion loan for two years. As the second-largest shareholder in Cairn, the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has asked for more information on the loan, even as the Street has demonstrated its apprehensions on the related-party transactions and use of surplus cash, which is supposed to be used for its own business &mdash; the company&rsquo;s stock tanked almost 6% during market hours once this information was made public. Whether companies use their surplus cash for share buyback or keep it as a war chest for future acquisitions or organic growth, the bottomline is that investors should keep an eye on where the cash is going.&nbsp;</p>', 'It''s not just Infosys, a clutch of heavyweights, too, are sitting on a huge cash pile.

(68, 16, '', 'How mid-tier IT player Cyient is changing into a product company', '<p class="p1">Engineering is something that has always been close to BVR Mohan Reddy&rsquo;s heart. A mechanical engineer by education, he pioneered computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) in India by introducing computer systems for design and manufacturing as early as 1982 as the MD of Tata Group company, OMC Computers. Indeed, having started off as a shop floor manager at DCM Industries, engineering had been part of most of his 18-year career, barring two stints of three years each, at Mico Bosch as a systems analyst and as sales manager at HCL tech. &ldquo;In my heart, I always wanted be an entrepreneur, but coming from a middle class background, I was always stumped at the question, &lsquo;What experience do you have in running a business?&rsquo; So, I decided to get some experience before I started,&rdquo; says the executive chairman of Cyient (formerly, Infotech Enterprises). Having tried his hand at production, sales and building a company, Reddy knew he was ready &mdash; and it had to be in engineering. In 1991, he started Infotech Enterprises with Rs 20 lakh of his own and two cheques of $10,000 ($1=Rs 25) from two friends. To avoid any conflict of interest with his last employer, who was focused on hardware and the domestic market, Reddy focused on software and the export markets. He quickly discovered that India was not trusted for its intellectual property in engineering (CAD/CAM), and decided to look at the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as the same software was used for drafting drawings and creating maps.</p>\n<p class="p3">In the 23 years since then, Cyient has come a long way, winning not just the trust of customers but also carving a niche for itself in engineering services across industries such as aerospace, transportation, utilities and semiconductors. Its list of customers includes names such as Pratt &amp; Whitney, Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, Alstom Tom Tom, Qualcomm and Philips. &ldquo;Customers used to call me a supplier and then we migrated to being a strategic partner. One client called us an integrated partner. I asked him what he meant by that and he said, &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t function without you.&rsquo; That was indeed a proud moment for us,&rdquo; says Reddy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Cyient co-innovates with clients to build products and as a result, holds several patents with its customers. For instance, it has built a bus power control unit with Pratt &amp; Whitney to control the input and output voltages in an aircraft. An aircraft requires different voltages for different functions &mdash; a lower voltage for the music system, while the oven needs a higher level &mdash; and Cyient&rsquo;s unit manages these requirements, ensuring there are no surges even during sudden altitude drops. This product straddles electrical and mechanical engineering capabilities and embedded software as well, making it a complex solution offering that the company believes not many can offer.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Changing order</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Now, Cyient is getting ready to make the next big leap, wherein it reduces its dependence on services and increases its contribution from system and solutions. Currently, services contribute 75% of revenue, systems bring in 20% and solutions bring in the remaining 5%. The plan is to increase the contribution of solutions in the next five years. Sundaraman Viswanathan, associate director, Zinnov, believes this is a step in the right direction. &ldquo;While Cyient has significant expertise in designing engineering products, there is also an opportunity in engineering analytics, where it can help clients analyse the data generated by the products to get insights that can either increase revenue or reduce costs. It can offer engineering design and analytics as an end-to-end solution. All it has to do is build smart products that talk to each other,&rdquo; he says, adding that solutions can make up one-fourth of the company&rsquo;s revenues over the next five years. Already, Cyient partners with most power companies on the US West Coast, managing the data from their smart girds. It wants to move to analysing the data to generate more revenue growth and improve customer satisfaction.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Creating a new mix- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Leading the transformation will be Reddy&rsquo;s son Krishna Bodanapu, who took over the reins as the company&rsquo;s CEO in April 2014 after spending 13 years climbing its ranks, starting as sales manager in Europe in 2001. &ldquo;There was a definite need for new blood in the company as the industry transforms, and the change happened at the right time,&rdquo; says Reddy. According to him, even their leadership styles are different; his son, says Reddy, is a big-picture guy who is very hands-off. &ldquo;He is very focused on achieving the key metrics and not how it is done, whereas I am a micromanager who likes to get his hands dirty,&rdquo; says the proud father.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">To complete its makeover, Cyient undertook a branding exercise in May 2014, where it changed its name from Infotech Enterprises to Cyient, which is a play on the words client and science, the key factors in the company&rsquo;s success. &ldquo;The idea was to have a name that is global and unique but, in a way, captures our past,&rdquo; says Reddy pointing out that the &lsquo;ient&rsquo; stands for Infotech Enterprises. But, surely, a name change is only a cosmetic exercise? Bodanapu agrees. &ldquo;But we are using the change as an impetus to drive several things, such as our new strategy and how we engage with customers,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>A new design</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Cyient is now focusing on building significant capabilities in product design. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of opportunity between product design and manufacturing, such as prototyping, testing, system integration and certification, and we want to tap that,&rdquo; says Bodanapu. Outsourcing in engineering services is not as mainstream as financial services. Here, not only are the contract sizes smaller but it takes time to buy into the customer&rsquo;s wallet as most activities are seen as critical. However, thanks to increasing pressures to reduce costs and Indian firms&rsquo; growing design capabilities, outsourcing of engineering services is expected to reach $38-50 billion by 2020 from around $2 billion now, according to a Nasscom-Booz Hamilton study. With product realisation and a comprehensive data analytics offering, Cyient hopes to become a full-lifecycle partner for customers from just providing design services.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Comfortably placed - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The company is looking to considerably increase sales from existing customers. &ldquo;We do have marquee names as our customers. While we are strategic partners to them, we are still not a substantial player, so there is a definite opportunity there,&rdquo; says Reddy. Revenue growth is a priority as the company had two tepid revenue growth years in FY13 (6.7%) and FY14 (5.3%) in dollar terms, as one of its key clients in the semiconductors space ramped down business. &ldquo;There is no denying that we have disappointed our investors on revenue growth; it has been a tough four or five quarters as one of our top 20 customers had some challenges. That is one of the perils of being a small company: you face the heat when one of your customers goes through challenging times. In 2009, when industry growth was almost flat, we grew by 15%, and last year, when the industry grew by 15%, we saw a modest growth of 5-6%. So you have to see these things in context,&rdquo; points out Bodanapu. Like its client list, the company has some marquee names as investors &mdash; PE firms such as Carlyle and ChrysCapital, which own more than 10% and 4-4.5% respectively. With demand picking in the US, analysts expect revenue, which is currently at Rs 2,200 crore, to grow at an average of 15-18% in the next two years, with operating margins remaining at around 20%.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Inorganic push</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Meanwhile, Cyient is looking at the inorganic route to acquire new customers and augment its revenue growth and service offerings. Recently, the company picked up a 51% stake in the US-based data analytics firm Invati Insights. While financial details are yet to be disclosed, the deal will strengthen Cyient&rsquo;s position in the analytics space, which is a focus area for the company. Earlier, in March 2014, Cyient acquired American IT services management company Softential Inc, for $20 million. The firm helps marquee clients such as Time Warner, Coca-Cola, Sprint and Verizon, among others, operate their network operations and data centres. While the integration process will be completed by April 2015, the company expects the acquisition to add $20 million-22 million in revenue and $4 million-5 million in profits in its first year.</p>\n<p class="p3">The acquisitions are to be funded&nbsp; with Cyient&rsquo;s Rs 726 crore cash chest. &ldquo;We are looking at companies in our existing markets of the US, the UK and Germany, since we hope to scale our presence in medical devices and electronics and will look at options that will help us do that quickly,&rdquo; says Bodanapu.</p>\n<p class="p3">Apart from the business model transformation, Reddy is keenly working on strengthening the leadership team. &ldquo;I am very happy with the current team, but once in a while I&rsquo;d like to fast forward and see how the organisation would be in 10 years and the kind of leaders we would need. So I work very strongly with the leadership team to develop new leaders,&rdquo; he says. Cyient currently has around 12,000 employees and, says Reddy, finding the right talent hasn&rsquo;t been easy. Ravi Menon, IT analyst, Centrum Broking, believes larger IT services have attracted the best talent by offering fatter hikes and faster career growth. &ldquo;With growth rates tapering for the big players, they can&rsquo;t afford fancy hikes and promotions every two years. This works to Cyient&rsquo;s advantage as it can match the hikes and offer candidates a better job profile. If you are an engineer, the prospect of creating a product will definitely be more appealing than being a drop in a larger ocean,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The big players'' tapering growth works to Cyient''s advantage because it can offer candidates a better profile" - Ravi Menon, IT analyst, Centrum Broking</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">So, will be it faster for a company of Cyient&rsquo;s size to migrate to systems and solutions, something even the big guys are focusing on these days? &ldquo;It is a difficult change. It is a running organisation so we have to ensure things go on as planned. If you want everyone to be a rocket scientist, then who is going to do the regular jobs? We have to get the trade-off right. You cannot ask the existing guys to do everything, so we will build a team to focus exclusively on solutions,&rdquo; says Bodanapu. But he is sure the move to non-linear revenues is inevitable. &ldquo;No services play the rate per hour game forever. More than the customer, competition is forcing companies to move the linear revenue model,&rdquo; he says. In a world where the big guys compete with mid-caps on most deals, niche players such as Cyient have an advantage. &ldquo;They are able to form deeper relationships with clients. They are the go-to guys for product development and that is a good place to be,&rdquo; says Viswanathan. Transition in any business is difficult, more so in a services-led business where migrating to a solutions-led model needs a significant mindset change. What works to Cyient&rsquo;s advantage is that its chosen area of engineering services lends itself to building solutions and products, making the transition much easier for itself.&nbsp;</p>', 'With a new brand identity and a new CEO at the helm, the erstwhile Infotech Enterprises is heading to make a mark in the systems and solutions businesses', '6', '', 0, '', 'how-mid-tier-it-player-cyient-is-changing-into-a-product-company-68', 63, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'How mid-tier IT player Cyient is changing into a product company', 'With a new brand identity and a new CEO at the helm, the erstwhile Infotech Enterprises is heading to make a mark in the systems and solutions businesses', '', '', '', 'Cyient,IT,Krishna Bodanapu,BVR Mohan Reddy', 0, NULL, '2015-01-14 17:49:56', NULL, '2014-09-19', 0);

(69, 16, '', 'Up close and personnel', '<p class="p1">Eleven years into his job, MV Jagannath Rao still hates the annual performance appraisal. As a senior computer scientist at Adobe India&rsquo;s Noida centre, he gets to do what he enjoys most &mdash; writing code and building software products. But he dislikes the hardsell involved in the once-a-year ritual of having to recall and list out the accomplishments of the past 12 months and then sit through an uncomfortable conversation with his supervisor. &ldquo;Managers are human: they remember your most recent work, not what you did earlier in the year. But it&rsquo;s embarrassing to keep saying, &lsquo;I did this. I did that&rsquo;,&rdquo; says 38-year-old Rao.</p>\n<p class="p3">A couple of years ago, when the San Jose-headquartered software giant said it was getting rid of annual performance reviews in <br /> favour of simpler, informal and regular Check-ins, Rao was relieved. Ever since, performance-related discussions with his manager are frequent and meaningful, minus the cumbersome paperwork and stress. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a one-way street anymore; it&rsquo;s a lot more iterative. My work gets communicated regularly and is fresh in the manager&rsquo;s memory,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Walking the talk</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">In November 2012, Adobe broke away from one of the most sacred and despised corporate traditions &mdash; the annual performance review or appraisal. Led by Global HR head, Donna Morris, the entire process was junked in favour of informal and frequent performance updates, in line with the company&rsquo;s changing business model. From a boxed software company with as much as two years between new product releases and a few updates in between, Adobe had transitioned to the cloud, where its products are now available on tap, for a subscription fee. Updates and new features had become frequent and through the year, requiring its teams to innovate in a dynamic space. Measuring output once a year, therefore, made little sense. &ldquo;Our people could not really wait for the end of the year to know how they did,&rdquo; says Jaleel Abdul, senior director of people resources for Asia Pacific and Japan at Adobe.</p>\n<p class="p3">The new approach was rolled out across Adobe&rsquo;s global locations, including India, where a third of its product development workforce sits. Naresh Chand Gupta, managing director, Adobe India, and senior VP for its print and publishing business unit, says the most widely used model that ranked people at various points on a bell curve (with a few top and bottom performers and everyone else in between)&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t relevant anymore. &ldquo;The bell curve was straight out of Jack Welch&rsquo;s GE model, suited to industrial organisations doing repetitive work,&rdquo; says Gupta. Work at Adobe instead involves building software products used by web designers, movie makers and photographers and is inherently creative in nature. &ldquo;If you put too much competition pressure, it&rsquo;s detrimental to output. There&rsquo;s plenty of teamwork and cooperation required,&rdquo; explains Gupta. The bell curve employee ranking system ends up having just the opposite effect by pitting employees against each other. &ldquo;We wanted to create a model where we got the benefits of a competitive environment and not put pressure on employees. You still have competition but you are competing with yourself.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Making Check-ins work in India is vital to Adobe&rsquo;s fortunes.&nbsp;With over 3,200 employees, India accounts for over a quarter of Adobe&rsquo;s 11,500-strong global workforce and is the company&rsquo;s second-largest location after the one in US. That number will only go up with the addition of a new campus each in Noida and Bengaluru, bigger than the ones which are currently in operation. &ldquo;We expect to end 2014 with around 3,300 people. This has been our biggest hiring year,&rdquo; says Abdul.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Transition period</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The formal transition to Check-ins began in mid-2012, involving 10,000 employees globally and 2,000 in India.&nbsp;It started with the HR department conducting workshops across locations and functions to explain the new approach and how it could be conducted, with onsite coaching support as well. An internal website was launched to provide information and tools to employees to work with the new programme.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Abdul explains that the traditional annual performance appraisal system was not really substituted with another system but it was more like letting go of an annual ritual that had no real sense of its purpose being clear to anyone in the organisation. &ldquo;Check-in is not a system. It is a philosophy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Check-in is not a system. It is a philosophy. This has been our biggest hiring year" - Jaleel Abdul, senior director (people resources), Asia Pacific and Japan, Adobe</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Informally, ahead of the actual shift, some team leaders and supervisors had been asked to try out quarterly performance discussions to see how it worked. Among them was Rekha Agarwal, who leads a team of 15 engineers in the Core Technology Group. Agarwal recalls that, initially, two of her high-performers were unhappy with the new system, as they were used to the ratings that came with annual review. They felt the earlier system was better as it put them ahead of team members. &ldquo;This is how our education system works. We have to be first in class in school or college. Now, we&rsquo;re not telling them that and they feel bad,&rdquo; she says. It took a couple of quarters for them to realise the new process was more effective and transparent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Checking in</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Check-in starts with setting of expectations at all levels, in line with overall business goals. &ldquo;We have put up the CEO&rsquo;s scorecard and priorities for 2014 on the intranet. Any employee can log in and see how they align with which part of the corporate philosophy,&rdquo; Abdul says. Then comes providing ongoing feedback, arguably &ldquo;the most painful part&rdquo;, he admits, with the frequency of Check-in meetings determined by the needs of a function, vertical or project team. At Agarwal&rsquo;s team, for instance, while the informal mandate is to do Check-ins at least every quarter, they happen sooner based on business requirements, sometimes even on a weekly basis.</p>\n<p class="p3">Under the old system, employees were assigned points and bucketed into four categories that defined performance &mdash; low, solid, strong and high &mdash; which determined their annual raise, bonus and promotion. The problem was that Agarwal, like other managers, had to force fit her team into any one bucket, with no room for intermediate points if she deemed fit. &ldquo;If I had two people working in the same team and with similar impact on a project, I had to differentiate between them,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The points system is still in force in a similar but continuous scale of performance: they can be awarded every three months. Thus, through the year, employees can improve based on the manager&rsquo;s feedback and increase their points tally in the final score.&nbsp;&ldquo;Employees are more trusting of the new approach because of the regular and focused feedback,&rdquo; Agarwal adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">There&rsquo;s also no form to fill now. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t want a new structure to replace the old one without consequent change in employee behaviour,&rdquo; says Abdul. &ldquo;Employees and managers agree to record goals in a format they mutually agree on and that works for their business.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Finally comes the growth and development aspect of the exercise. &ldquo;This is owned by the employee and supported by the manager,&rdquo; says Abdul. &ldquo;You need to know what your aspirations are and we will give you the resources to help achieve your career goals.&rdquo; These could range from connecting employees with a learning programme or funding their learning efforts. While, in a way, this puts the onus of charting their careers on the employees, it also requires managers to be more involved with employees&rsquo; career growth. &ldquo;This is an indication of managerial maturity while operating in an ambiguous space. We are giving them a lot of latitude and responsibility to manage,&rdquo; says Abdul.</p>\n<p class="p3">How does this impact rewards? That is still a judgement call, says Abdul. Managers can&rsquo;t routinely take the easy way out and do an equitable distribution, but have to take the effort to understand and evaluate performance more judiciously. It may turn out that a couple of people are rewarded similarly, but that would be based on the performance assessment by the manager, open to scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Check-ins are a welcome change for managers who were uncomfortable with forced bell curve allocations of rewards and the justification they had to give each time. Rahul Vishwaroop, senior quality engineering manager leading the product testing team for InDesign at Adobe India, recalls it as an &ldquo;annual punishment for managers&rdquo;. The 40-year-old Vishwaroop endured it during his nearly 15 years with Adobe, both as a team member and supervisor. &ldquo;For many of us, the appraisal system doesn&rsquo;t come easy. I like people management but trying to document that is something else. Given a choice, I wouldn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; he says. His team includes 18 people &mdash; 15 in India, two in China and one in Japan &mdash; who are responsible for the overall quality of the product. Four report directly to him, while 11, who are younger in the system, are assigned to a manager who, in turn, reports to him. Vishwaroop often found that appraisals had quite the opposite effect &mdash; employees were less interested in performance discussions and more in the salary raise or promotion they were hoping to get. &ldquo;Appraisals would coincide with rewards. People wouldn&rsquo;t focus on the feedback,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Under the new system, he meets direct staff once every two weeks and indirect staff every eight weeks (for overseas managers, it is a video call). &ldquo;We keep it as an open agenda meeting. We talk about progress against goals, course correction, recalibration or change of goals,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Overall, I&rsquo;m happier now than I was in the past. Unpleasant surprises are reduced or eliminated.&rdquo; Among Adobe India&rsquo;s earliest employees &mdash; from when it had barely 25 employees &mdash; Vishwaroop is clear that Check-ins are the way ahead in transparency and efficacy. &ldquo;Now, managers don&rsquo;t need to colour their feedback in such a way that it ties in with the reward.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Adobe is also constantly monitoring the system to check how well it is functioning. In addition to feedback from people leaving the company, it also conducts theme-based internal surveys to gauge employee mood twice or thrice a year. The results are collated within a couple of weeks and quick action is taken on areas of concern, says Abdul.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Benefits buildup</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The benefits of Check-in have been felt across the company&rsquo;s global operations, with the 80,000-odd man hours managers spent doing the exercise each year dispensed with &mdash; in India, the switch meant saving about 20,000 man hours. Earlier, the nearly five-month exercise would begin in early November and continue till March the following year (Adobe follows a December-November business cycle). Now it&rsquo;s an ongoing process without disruption of work or sleepless nights for managers and their teams. &ldquo;We forgot why we started doing appraisals in the first place. We got so enamoured by the system that it became a bureaucratic process. The governance of it overtook the substance,&rdquo; says Abdul.</p>\n<p class="p3">The company claims that internal engagement scores went up, as reflected in surveys.&nbsp;&ldquo;Our engagement scores over the past two rounds at country level have moved up by 6%,&rdquo; says Abdul. Voluntary or &ldquo;regrettable&rdquo; attrition (people quitting) post the review season has dropped to single digits, even as involuntary attrition (people asked to leave) is higher, reflecting that performance is being closely aligned to the organisation&rsquo;s goals. &ldquo;After having let go of the rank and rating method, the quality of focus on performance has actually gone up,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">A direct correlation between the new initiative and bottomline can&rsquo;t be established &mdash; Adobe declined to share numbers that would help establish an effect on performance. &ldquo;Our voluntary attrition used to be in early double digits until 2012. In the past two years, we have been able to bring it down to single digits. A combination of factors, including improved quality of performance conversation, contributed to this phenomenon,&rdquo; is the only comment from a spokesperson. &ldquo;Employees feel this is a fairer system,&rdquo; says Gupta. &ldquo;In stack ranking, they experience a sense of helplessness. In this system the sense is, &lsquo;At least I control my destiny.&rsquo; To us, that is a validation of the system&rsquo;s success.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In their February 2014 book, <em>Scaling Up Excellence</em>, Stanford professors Robert Sutton and Hayagreeva Rao mention there was a 50% increase in involuntary departures and a 30% drop in voluntary attrition within a year or so of the programme being rolled out. But, Sutton cautions, &ldquo;Yes, those numbers were shared and approved officially, but they are only for the first year or so of the programme.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Hurdles ahead</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Check-in hasn&rsquo;t been without its share of challenges. For its&nbsp;500-odd managers in India,&nbsp;it has been difficult to adapt to, given the ambiguity involved. &ldquo;The conversation is shifting from, &lsquo;when will I get a promotion and raise&rsquo; to &lsquo;how do I learn, add value and contribute to the company&rsquo;s business objectives&rsquo;. Those are the kind of conversations we&rsquo;re helping managers have with employees. And that&rsquo;s a hard one to do,&rdquo; admits Abdul.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Adapting to a new approach was a painstaking process and managers, the key pillar for this to work, were the hardest to orient. &ldquo;They come from a structure saying, &lsquo;Give me a form; give me a template.&rsquo; We had to invest disproportionately in making managers unlearn the hierarchical ladder of performance. To do this and yet be effective, to inspire, engage employees and be seen as fair, is a challenge for them,&rdquo; says Abdul. &ldquo;One of our biggest change management efforts has been to equip managers for this reality,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have spent an approximate 2,400 hours around these efforts in the last year alone.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Adobe isn&rsquo;t in the clear yet. A July 2014 case study prepared by Stanford Graduate School of Business says, &ldquo;survey feedback highlighted the fact that some employees did not fully understand how the Check-in approach worked &mdash; they were unclear, for example, as to how to set expectations. In this context, one of the major challenges associated with providing autonomy to leaders was the fact that the application was inconsistent across groups. Survey results revealed that some managers were still uncomfortable having difficult conversations with employees.

(71, 20, '', 'Too hot to handle', '<p class="p1">The revival or, rather, survival of the debt-ridden Bhushan Steel, founded in 1989 by Brij Bhushan Singal, now hinges on the hopes of a takeover. Nearly 75% of the company&rsquo;s market cap has been wiped out since the arrest in early August of Bhushan Steel&rsquo;s promoters on bribery charges. The question on everyone&rsquo;s mind now is whether the company can serve as an ideal takeover target.</p>\n<p class="p3">Though the promoters hold about 65% stake in the company, 75% of this is pledged with banks and financial institutions. Post correction in share prices, the lenders are sitting on huge losses. In this situation, most market experts believe that though it is too early to take a call, any takeover at this stage will be tricky given the ownership of its promoters and the role of banks and regulators. The central bank has put the Rs 40,000-crore exposure of banks under the corrective action plan (CAP) &mdash; the first case since RBI devised such a mechanism as part of its &lsquo;framework for revitalising distressed assets in the economy&rsquo;. Though a mechanism like the corporate debt restructuring currently exists, it&rsquo;s not clear how the CAP is going to speed up things in this case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">For now, all eyes are on how the lenders are looking to deal with the situation and whether the promoters will be in a position to meet their obligations. With about 5 million tonne capacity and good assets in its portfolio, Bhushan Steel is considered to be one of the leading players in the market. The integrated company manufactures automotive and white goods steel, a market that enjoys higher margins. In fact, thanks to the company&rsquo;s exposure to value-added products, Bhushan Steel&rsquo;s blended gross steel realisation &mdash; at Rs 54,000 per tonne in Q4FY14 &mdash; is one of the highest in the industry.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Today, to establish a million tonne-capacity integrated steel plant, the company will need about $1 billion [Rs 6,000 crore],&rdquo; says Goutam Chakraborty, who tracks the steel sector at Emkay Global Financial Services. Going by the replacement value theory, Bhushan Steel&rsquo;s current steel manufacturing capacity of about 5 million tonne is valued at about Rs 30,000 crore. Add to this another Rs 5,000 crore from ongoing projects and the total value of these assets can be estimated to be in the region of about Rs 35,000 crore. &ldquo;We believe that since the replacement cost (around Rs 35,000 crore) is lower than the market valuations at about Rs 41,000 crore to Rs 42,000 crore, including the debt and current market captialisation of the company at about Rs 3,000 crore, the buyer or acquirer will only follow suit at a lower share price,&rdquo; says an independent market expert.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>The way out?</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Pricing of such assets will be crucial as, on the one hand, the financial institutions that hold pledged shares of the company would want to sell the shares at higher rates, while on the other hand, buyers will be looking for lower prices. Independent market analyst Satish Ramanathan says, &ldquo;The likes of ArcelorMittal and JSW would want to buy the stock at a discounted price rather than the market price. But there is nothing preventing these buyers from paying over the assets, given the time value of money they save in doing so.&rdquo; Of the three players, JSW has been the most active, carrying out a spate of acquisitions that include Ispat Industries and Welspun Maxsteel.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Out of control - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Analysts believe that putting up a 5 million tonne plant in and around the user industry and acquiring land could be an uphill task and could take a few years. For instance, a plant costing Rs 35,000 crore today could actually cost Rs 46,500 crore if the interest cost at 10% is accounted for during the gestation period, assuming that the commissioning happens within three years. In this case, even after accounting for (deducting) the debt, the company&rsquo;s assets could actually have good value left for shareholders. Meanwhile, only time will tell who has the bargaining power, particularly in the light of the company&rsquo;s lenders looking to exit and the company being in deep trouble.</p>\n<p class="p3">In the recent past, Bhushan Steel has been featured in the news for all the wrong reasons. From mounting debt, piling losses and high interest and depreciation costs to the shutting down of its Dhenekanal plant by the Odisha State Pollution Control Board and the subsequent arrest of company officials, the steel maker has found itself floundering in a mess of its own making. And a bribery scandal involving managing director and vice-chairman Neeraj Singhal, followed by his subsequent arrest, allegedly on charges of paying a Rs 50-lakh bribe to SK Jain, CMD of Syndicate Bank, has certainly not helped matters.</p>\n<p class="p3">The problems started to mount from the last fiscal, as the company started to witness declining volumes hitting revenue and profits. In FY14, its sales volumes fell to 1.98 million tonne, compared with 2.3 million tonne in FY13. This had a negative impact on operating profits and the problems were further compounded thanks to the interest costs it incurred on borrowed funds for existing and ongoing projects. To put this in perspective, in FY14, it incurred an interest cost of Rs 1,663 crore, compared with Rs 1,287 crore in FY13, which was almost half of its operating profit. This indicates that on the top of the unfavorable business cycle, a large part of the company&rsquo;s profits were used for servicing debt.</p>\n<p class="p3">The reason behind this was that in Q2FY14, as compared with the previous six months, long-term debt ballooned sharply by Rs 4,000 crore. This was primarily due to the fact that the company went on a capacity-augmenting spree, going in for a brownfield expansion in Tarapur by setting up a plant there and augmenting capacity at its plant in Dhenekal. The capacity was ramped up to 4.4 million metric tonne for flat products and 1.7 million metric tonne for long products.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">As such, Bhushan Steel today is overleveraged, with a debt-equity ratio of 3.5, and this has proved to be the Achilles&rsquo; heel for India&rsquo;s sixth-largest steel-maker as it is reeling under a pile of debt. An equity infusion of Rs 6,000 crore is required today to pare the company&rsquo;s debt. Such an infusion can help bring debt levels down to Rs 30,000 crore and bring down the debt-equity ratio to a still-high 3.1, but getting that is difficult following the arrest of its promoters.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Arrested development&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Following Singhal&rsquo;s arrest on August 6, the stock plummeted to a 52-week low of Rs 305 per share, a drop of nearly 20%. To ensure that the company&rsquo;s debt burden is not declared an NPA, a consortium of lenders led by the State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and others &mdash; who have a total combined exposure of Rs 40,000 crore in the company &mdash; decided to take over the reins by appointing three independent directors to its board to monitor operations. An independent non-executive director, VK Mehrotra, has resigned from the 11-member board citing &ldquo;failing health&rdquo; as the reason.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Melting point - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">As per the CAP, a decision agreed upon by a minimum of 75% of creditors by value and 60% of creditors by number would be considered the basis for proceeding with the restructuring or recovery action of the account, and will be binding on the lenders under the terms of the inter-creditor agreement. But getting a consensus won&rsquo;t be easy. Take the case of United Bank of India, which is also a lender to the company. Executive director Sanjay Arya was quoted in a newspaper report as saying, &ldquo;A promoter-director of Bhushan has been arrested for activities they were doing in their individual capacities but it isn&rsquo;t [connected to] the operations of the company or its performance. The account is still standard and nowhere is it an NPA.&rdquo; The bankers&rsquo; apprehension is not entirely unfounded, considering that the daily working of the company is still in the hands of its top management. A forensic audit of Bhushan Steel&rsquo;s books has been ordered and the promoters have been directed to infuse equity to deleverage the firm. However, an equity infusion may be hard to come by and may take a while, which is why the banks have ordered Bhushan to sell its non-core assets as a stopgap measure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Currently, margins are under pressure because of the high cost of iron ore. But if iron ore mining resumes and the company is able to operate at full capacity for the next two to three quarters, operating margins should be stable and we could expect a sharp uptick soon after. In the coming quarters, margins may be around 20% and could reach 30% at an operating profit level once the situation improves,&rdquo; says a market source who did not wish to be named.</p>\n<p class="p3">If the company is not able to bring down its debt burden, it could well be on the block for an acquisition. Bhushan needs a cash infusion in order to repay its debt, of which nearly Rs 2,300 crore is due in the current fiscal. Given the current mess, it is highly unlikely that any entity will be willing to put in equity into the company and an external investor has to come in to keep it afloat. In the absence of an investor, if the banks decide to sell the assets, there are plenty of domestic players who would be interested in augmenting their capacity and taking over the business.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Bhushan is overleveraged. Also, given that the share price has eroded so rapidly, the company&rsquo;s ability to attract capital is questionable. And that is the key requirement today. Having said that, it produces high-quality products and delivers the products its customers need. So, there is no business risk here, just a financial liability,&rdquo; sums up Ramanathan.&nbsp;</p>', 'The Street is betting on a takeover of the beleaguered Bhushan Steel, which needs a quick equity infusion to stay afloat', '11', '', 0, '', 'too-hot-to-handle-71', 66, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Too hot to handle', 'The Street is betting on a takeover of the beleaguered Bhushan Steel, which needs a quick equity infusion to stay afloat', '', '', '', 'Bhushan Steel,Neeraj Singhal,JSW,ArcelorMittal', 0, NULL, '2015-01-14 18:48:35', NULL, '2014-09-19', 0),
(72, 20, '', 'When the going is good', '<p class="p1">The bulls are making the most of their free run on the Street but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have impacted pledged holdings. Indeed, as many as 60 companies from the BSE 500 universe have increased their pledges in the past two quarters. In value terms, pledged holdings increased from Rs 1.28 lakh crore to Rs 1.78 lakh crore, primarily spurred by the sentiment-driven rally what with the Sensex gaining almost 25% over the past two quarters. Overall, pledged holdings as percentage of the overall market cap has increased to 2.03% as on date from 2.02% in December 2013. Incidentally, pledged holdings, as percentage of total market-cap, was the highest at 2.6% in the June 2009 quarter when the markets regulator made it mandatory for promoters to disclose their pledged holdings in the wake of the Satyam scandal.</p>\n<p class="p3">Among BSE 500 companies, 29 companies have notched up their pledged promoter holding by more than 5% in the past two quarters. Around 140 companies have some portion of their promoter holding pledged, while 41 companies have more than 50% of their promoter holding pledged as on June 30, 2014. The companies that have significantly hiked their pledged holding over the past two quarters include Adani Power, Indiabulls Power, Punj Lloyd, Reliance Power, Bilt and Apollo Hospitals. The Tata Group&rsquo;s overall pledged holding has also increased from 1.56% to 2.07% over the past six months.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">So, why are blue-chip stocks such as Tata pledging additional shares in a buoyant market environment? Usually, promoter pledging is the last resort for companies to raise money after they&rsquo;ve run out of easy money sources. The reasons for pledging vary from company to company, say analysts. The prospect of an economic climate conducive to investment brought about by the change in political leadership is encouraging some cash-strapped companies, especially in the infrastructure and power sectors, to pledge shares to fund their expansion plans. Some of them are cashing in on the rise in share prices by pledging more shares.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>One way or the other - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">A sector-wise analysis indicates that capex-heavy sectors like real estate, infrastructure and power are the big pledgers. Consumer discretionary (18%), industrial (17.5%), and energy sector (16.7%) companies, many of which are facing a liquidity crunch, contribute the highest quantum of promoter pledges in terms of percentage of total pledged equity in the market. &ldquo;Since pledging shares is the fastest way to raise capital, most promoters do this in order to raise bridge funding for company operations,&rdquo; says Ambareesh Baliga, managing partner, Global Wealth Management, Edelweiss Financial Services. Adds UR Bhat, managing director of Dalton Capital: &ldquo;My guess is that these are aggressive, ambitious people who are funding their initial payments for acquisitions and new projects by pledging their promoter holding. Until the final deal is struck, companies often find it difficult find funding from traditional sources.&rdquo; Indeed, Adani Power&rsquo;s recent acquisition of Lanco&rsquo;s Udupi power plant, the biggest in the thermal space, indicates this. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Analysts warn that pledging does not necessarily portend doom. &ldquo;Pledges are not always a sign that something is wrong with the company,&rdquo; says Yogesh Radke head of quantitative research, Edelweiss. &ldquo;Often, promoters pledge holdings for daily capital needs and operational work.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>The flip side</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">While overall pledging has gone up over the past two quarters, it has also decreased in the short-term, falling from 2.08% in March 2014 to 2.03% in June 2014, with 65 companies in the BSE 500 universe redeeming pledges in the past six months. &ldquo;One of the reasons some promoters are revoking their pledges is that markets have improved because of which the extra margin requirement for borrowers will have come off. Another reason is that because people are able to raise money more easily, it is possible for promoters to redeem their pledges,&rdquo; says Baliga. Indeed, an increasing number of companies are raising money through Qualified Institutional Placements. According to Prime Database, over Rs 18,000 crore&nbsp; has been raised through QIPs since the beginning of the fiscal.</p>\n<p class="p3">While everything is hunky-dory right now, a market correction would mean bad news for promoters who have pledged most of their holding and could possibly see some of their holdings being sold off by lenders. To curb the volatility in the market due to sale of pledged shares, the RBI has stipulated that NBFCs with an asset size of above Rs 100 crore have to maintain a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 50%. Also, these NBFCs can only accept Group-1 shares as collateral while giving loans above Rs 5 lakh and report the same to the exchanges. At present, some NBFCs are giving loans at an LTV ratio of 65-70%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a necessary risk-containing measure, but it&rsquo;ll have an impact on the number of stocks on which margin funding was given. Quite a few Group 1 stocks are in the F&amp;O segment. The real funding requirement was for the other stocks,&rdquo; sums up Baliga. &nbsp;</p>', 'The rally on the Street is giving some promoters a chance to revoke their pledged holdings and some, a chance to borrow afresh', '14', '', 0, '', 'when-the-going-is-good-72', 67, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'When the going is good', 'The rally on the Street is giving some promoters a chance to revoke their pledged holdings and some, a chance to borrow afresh', '', '', '', '', 0, NULL, '2015-01-14 18:59:02', NULL, '2014-09-19', 0);

(73, 20, '', 'Plastic money', '<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s mid-afternoon &mdash; 2.30 p.m. to be precise &mdash; in Pimpri-Chinchwad, the industrial belt of Pune, but the weather is surprisingly pleasant with a cool nip in the air, thanks to the monsoon. As we make our way to the gates of Finolex Industries&rsquo; head office, what immediately grab our attention are the huge stacks of pipelines laid across the vast plot &mdash; 70 acres in all &mdash; and several trucks manoeuvring through the maze of these pipes. Standing smack in the middle of the massive mounds of plastic is a four-storeyed building that is home to the country&rsquo;s largest PVC pipe major that currently lords over the #6,000 crore organised market with 28% share <em>(see: The big picture)</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Wired to follow a predictable line of questioning as an analyst, the first few questions I ask Finolex MD SS Dhanorkar are: &ldquo;Why does your company continue to use prime industrial land for an activity that has very low economic value? And what is the reason for the huge inventory pile-up?&rdquo; Sitting in his spartan cabin, the 57-year-old Dhanorkar, who has been at the helm at Finolex for the past 31 years, replies rather candidly, &ldquo;We do want to monetise the land, which is currently worth Rs 700 crore, but there are hardly any buyers. And the inventory you see outside will vanish once the monsoon ends and the festive season kicks in.&rdquo; The reason is that Finolex generates about 70% of its revenue supplying PVC pipes for irrigation, apart from for construction activities, both of which largely kick off post monsoon. &ldquo;We need to stock up <span class="s1">on pipes so that we can comfortably meet the growing demand in future,&rdquo; adds Dhanorkar.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class="p4">With pipe manufacturing capacity of 230,000 tonne under its fold, the Rs 2,500-crore Finolex Industries has clocked annual sales and profit growth of 10% and 24% over the past five years, as its capacity doubled over the same period. The robust profit growth is a clear indication that the company enjoys good pricing power despite a modest sales growth. So, it&rsquo;s not surprising that the stock market took a fancy for the stock, which has dished out a 150% return over the past one year. Going forward, while the Street will be excited about the management&rsquo;s plan to monetise its landholding, what actually makes the company, which has a market cap of over Rs 3,500 crore, an interesting prospect is the business it derives its strength from. But to assess what the future holds, it is important to understand how the past unfolded at Finolex.</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Strategic move</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">In 1945, Prahlad P Chhabria and his brother, Kishan P Chhabria, came down from Karachi to settle in Pune. They started a small electrical cables shop before venturing into the manufacture of PVC insulated cables in the following decade (now undertaken by a separate company, Finolex Cables). Finolex, which is a portmanteau of &lsquo;fine&rsquo; and &lsquo;flexible&rsquo;, moved into pipe manufacturing a few decades later as the Chhabrias realised the potential of the pipes business and found pipe manufacturing a natural extension thanks to the similar process and technology used.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">The brothers started with a 5,000-tonne pipe manufacturing capacity in the early 1980s, making them pioneers in India. &ldquo;The biggest problem in this era was that as the pipe business grew, importing resin was an uphill task because of the difficulty of getting an import licence and restrictions on foreign transactions, thus limiting our growth and profitability. We realised these difficulties and to deal with the situation, put up a huge investment for manufacturing our own resin,&rdquo; recalls Dhanorkar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">The unit, with a capacity of 130,000 tonne, was operational by 1993. This was huge, given that Finolex Industries&rsquo; own consumption of resin at the time was not more than 15,000 tonne. By default, then, Finolex ended up becoming a resin player, at a time when Reliance Industries too had huge resin capacity, making India surplus in the product. But, gradually, because of the demand from PVC pipe manufacturers, this surplus capacity started getting absorbed, and by 2002-2003, India again became resin-deficient. That&rsquo;s when Finolex decided to double its capacity, to 260,000 tonne &mdash; this was twice as much as the group needed for captive consumption. And initially, in the absence of internal consumption, a large part of the resin was sold in the open market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">The backward integration turned into a weakness. Finolex had invested in the capacity expansion using borrowed funds and its attention, understandably, remained on building the resin business. But troubles were mounting. Over the years, the user industry (buyer of raw material) made more money by selling pipes directly to consumers, compared with players such as Finolex, which was supplying low-margin resin to these pipe manufacturers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Besides, with increasing competition, Finolex could not exercise pricing power and PVC resin, which is a petroleum derivative, was feeling the impact of international price fluctuations and currency management. More importantly, because its customers for resin were largely confined to industrial clients, Finolex had little control on the price, which put pressure on operating margins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Even otherwise, operating margins in the resin business were hardly 6-8% and prone to volatility because of the swing in global petroleum prices. For instance, when the global crude oil prices peaked at $140 a barrel during the financial meltdown, in that financial year &mdash; 2008 &mdash; the company made an operating margin of 10.7%, against 13.4% in FY06. It didn&rsquo;t help that the company was managing huge forex risks and had high working capital needs. &ldquo;About three years back, because of forex exposure dealing in currency derivatives, we had about Rs 400 crore liability, which now stands at about #30-40 crore,&rdquo; says Dhanorkar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">That apart, because of imported raw material inventories, it used to run huge working capital requirements, which were largely funded through bank credit. A direct fallout of this volatility and fragile financial profile was that earnings predictability was very low, which, coupled with investor fears about the capital-intensive and commoditised nature of the business, had a bearing on its share prices, as investors refrained from paying higher valuations. &ldquo;We were viewed as a commodity company operating on wafer-thin margins, further compounded by earnings volatility,&rdquo; points out Dhanorkar.</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>The inflection point</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">In FY12, the founders handed over the reins of the business to Prahlad&rsquo;s son, Prakash, and a strategic shift in the company&rsquo;s operations came about, one that entailed renewing focus on the pipes business. In other words, the resin capacity was used to feed and grow the PVC pipes business. Today, while the PVC resin capacity is static at 270,000 tonne (2006 level), the PVC pipe capacity has nearly doubled &mdash; from 114,000 tonne to 230,000 tonne. As a result, 90% of the resin capacity is used in captive consumption. Further, the company has managed to move up the value chain by venturing into producing higher-margin PVC fittings. Where resin fetches margins of 6-8%, PVC pipes earn margins of 10-12% and PVC fittings rake in as much as 18-22% margins, thanks to the last two being consumer-facing businesses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">The biggest challenge for the new man at the top now was to add more consumers by expanding the company&rsquo;s network, and the management was up to the task. Finolex Industries&rsquo; backward integration and strong brand equity worked to its advantage, allowing the company to gradually expand its pipe business, both in terms of its products and geographic diversification. Says Vinay Khattar, head of research at Edelweiss Wealth, &ldquo;In PVC pipes, there is huge competition from both organised and unorganised players, but Finolex enjoys huge brand equity in the minds of consumers. In fact, its products are largely sold to dealers on a cash-and-carry basis, which is a reflection of its strong branding. The fact that its pipes command a premium price also reflects its position over its competitors.&rdquo; Currently, Finolex is the leader in organised PVC pipes, followed by large players such as Jain Irrigation and Supreme Industries, which have market shares of 15% and 8%, respectively.</p>\n<p class="p4">Switching back to PVC pipes has helped reduce volatility in margins and earnings, says Dhanorkar. &ldquo;Moreover, we are now able to leverage our network and customers&rsquo; trust in our quality, thus exercising some pricing power.&rdquo; Currently, it has a network of 600 dealers, over 1,500 sub-dealers and 15,000 retail points covering south, west and north India. Today, 40% of Finolex&rsquo;s revenue comes from west India, 30% from the south, 20% from the north and the remaining from east India. It is now looking to the north and east to consolidate more market share. &ldquo;We are testing some of the markets and regions &mdash; such as UP, Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal &mdash; that are ignored or where we do not have large presence,&rdquo; points out Prakash.</p>\n<p class="p4">Post this shift in focus, Finolex&rsquo;s business, too, has become more predictable and structurally sound because of the sustained demand for plastic pipes, which continues to grow at 10-12% a year. Interestingly, higher growth is also a result of plastic pipes emerging as a substitute for cement and galvanised steel pipes, which are relatively costly. Plastic pipes are now available in different shapes, diameters and thickness and made from different materials to suit varied requirements. Accordingly, demand has shifted, to some extent, from cement and steel pipes to plastic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Today, though the company is not entirely insulated from volatility in the resin business, it is able to pass on cost increases and protect its margins. The increasing contribution of high-margin businesses such as pipes and fittings has also helped Finolex improve its operating margins and return ratios. From 47% of revenue in FY12, PVC pipes&rsquo; share has now gone up to 64% <em>(see: Changing mix)</em>, while the share of fittings, that is clubbed within the PVC pipes segment, is up from 5% to 8%. Consequently, operating margin is now 19%, compared with 11.96% in FY12.</p>\n<p class="p4">Return on shareholders&rsquo; funds, too, has increased from 9.63% in FY12 to 22.5% in FY14. Now, Finolex doesn&rsquo;t plan to add further resin capacity &mdash; the business doesn&rsquo;t use capital as efficiently and brings lower returns. Accordingly, says Dhanorkar, even if Finolex requires more resin for its PVC pipes manufacturing, it will buy the raw material from the open market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Bolstering the books</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">Bringing the focus back to pipes has meant Finolex Industries has had to invest heavily in new manufacturing capacity as well as increasing its distribution reach. This investment was partly financed by debt and, as a result, the company accumulated debt of #840 crore in FY13. But that concern is easing as the business has started to throw more money and cash flows have improved, which is being used to strengthen the balance sheet. &ldquo;Our focus is on becoming a billion-dollar company in&nbsp;five years from now,&rdquo; says Prakash. Currently, Finolex Industries generates cash flow of around Rs 200 crore a year, which is expected to grow to Rs 300 crore by FY16 thanks to better margins. This money is now being used to retire debt. About Rs 200 crore was retired in FY14, bringing down the total debt to around Rs 600 crore and improving the debt-to-equity and return ratios. Debt-to-equity has come down from 1.2 in FY13 to 0.9 in FY14. Retiring debt has also helped the company save on interest costs, thus increasing profit and return on shareholder funds. More importantly, future cash flows, too, will be used to retire debt. &ldquo;The pipe business is remunerative, with an RoC of around 40%. As its contribution to revenue increases, we will become debt-free over the next three years, and this should reflect in the return ratios,&rdquo; says Dhanorkar.</p>\n<p class="p4">That sounds feasible, since a large part of business capital expenditure, such as investing in capacities, is already in place. Indeed, even after investing the Rs 50 crore-Rs 60 crore that may be required for brownfield expansion of the existing PVC pipe manufacturing capacity, the company should be left with Rs 200 crore-Rs 250 crore of free cash annually. That&rsquo;s a good sign for investors, as they can now look forward to higher dividends in the coming years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">In FY14, Finolex distributed Rs 80 crore as dividend (Rs 6.5 per share) against Rs 43.3 crore (Rs 5.5 per share) the previous year. Interestingly, the promoters are the largest shareholders, with a 52.46% stake in the company.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>Ripe for re-rating</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">As business dynamics change and Finolex&rsquo;s financial performance improves, it is quite possible that its stock, too, will soon be re-rated. Markets tend to give higher premium to companies that generate strong free cash flows, earn better returns for shareholders, have less debt and make strong operating margins. Finolex is improving its position on these four counts, which, over a period of time, should reflect in the valuations that the market is willing to offer. &ldquo;We are extending our product basket and geographical reach. We are also investing in our brand and visibility,&rdquo; says Prakash.</p>\n<p class="p4">At current market capitalisation of Rs 3,307 crore (share price of Rs 288), the company is valued at 16 times one-year forward earnings. However, the Street believes that these valuations do not capture Finolex&rsquo;s changing financial profile, which is to some extent comparable with its competitors such as Supreme Industries and Astral Poly that are in the value-added products segment and generate similar margins and returns for the shareholders. &ldquo;Finolex is fast transitioning to a PVC pipes company from being a predominantly PVC resin manufacturer. The transition (B2B to B2C) will lead to the company capturing incremental margins and narrow valuation gap,&rdquo; says Kashyap Pujara, executive director of Axis Capital, in a note on the company.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">For now, Finolex is trading at an attractive multiple, compared with Supreme Industries and Astral Poly, which are trading at 27 times and 50 times. (<em>see: Going cheap</em>) Though its competitors make higher returns and are financially sounder &mdash; which is also a reason for this divergence &mdash; if Finolex stays on its course, it could deserve a higher price, too. &ldquo;The company appears to be in a sweet spot, aided by multiple drivers, such as increased revenues from PVC pipes and fittings businesses, margin expansion and contracting forex losses through appropriate hedging policy. All these factors would lead to strong earnings growth (20% annual growth over FY14-16) and trigger a re-rating in the stock,&rdquo; says Edelweiss&rsquo; Khattar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Considering that the industry has structural growth drivers (in fact, if government projects such as linking of rivers see the light of the day, this industry could grow even faster), and Finolex being the leader, its investors should do well over a period of time. Importantly, improving return ratios with a renewed focus on high-margin businesses and conscious attempt to bring down debt to zero and higher free cash flows could help Finolex create higher value for investors. This is one company that has assured growth in the pipeline. &nbsp;</p>', 'Finolex Industries'' increasing focus on high-margin PVC pipes and improving return ratios make for an attractive play', '8', '', 0, '', 'plastic-money-73', 68, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Plastic money', 'Finolex Industries'' increasing focus on high-margin PVC pipes and improving return ratios make for an attractive play', '', '', '', 'Finolex Industries,Prakash Chhabria', 0, NULL, '2015-01-14 19:09:43', NULL, '2014-09-19', 0),

Left wheelchair bound ever since an accident at the age of 11, for 41-year-old Jindal, access means having to navigate offices, homes, bus stops, railway stations, hospitals and schools with limited mobility. She recounts an ordeal during a journey from Delhi to Allahabad by train. &ldquo;I was wheeled through railway tracks to reach the other platform. Once inside the train, we realised that there was no space for the wheelchair to turn. I had to be lifted and placed on my seat,&rdquo; she recalls. Add to this the frequent, insensitive enquiries by airline or hospital staff &mdash; &ldquo;<em>Aap kya zara sa bhi nahi uth sakte</em>? (Can you not move even a little bit?)&rdquo; &mdash; as they try to help her to her seat.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">After years of dealing with such issues, Jindal decided to take control of the situation by launching Svayam in 2001 with the support of the Jindal Group in order to create awareness about accessibility issues. Once she realised that mere dissemination of information was not enough, though, Svayam started getting actively involved in grassroots work. &ldquo;India has perhaps the best policies and disabled-friendly infrastructure, but all on paper,&rdquo; Jindal says. So, she decided to work with the government and in 2007 appealed to the ministry of tourism to release annual funds to state governments and agencies only if they ensure that historical and tourist sites are fully accessible. &ldquo;The proposal was accepted and Delhi&rsquo;s Qutub Minar is our biggest success story,&rdquo; she beams.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;Thereafter, Jindal worked with the Archaeological Survey of India to make World Heritage Sites in Delhi, Agra and Goa barrier-free. &ldquo;In the world of tourism, we need to project India as &lsquo;Incredible, Accessible India&rsquo;,&rdquo; she says. Besides helping introduce a query relating to differently abled persons in the Census, Svayam functions as a one-stop shop for anything to do with accessibility, having been invited by government agencies, such as the NDMC and the ministry of education, government of Delhi, to make public conveniences and schools accessible and barrier-free.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Jindal feels that much can be done with respect to attitudinal changes and sensitisation, when it comes to accessibility issues. &ldquo;The government wants to take steps towards increasing access but nobody sensitises civil engineers or contractors about such things. They sometimes don&rsquo;t even know why ramps are installed. And most schools don&rsquo;t even accept handicapped children.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Thankfully, there is no lack of success stories for her to feel good about the future of accessibility in the country. With a glint in her eyes, she recounts the day she felt great pride at the work done by Svayam: seeing an old man in a wheelchair getting into one of the state transport buses using a ramp installed with the help of the organisation.</p>\n<p class="p3">For most people, it is quite hard to balance work with their passions and ensure that they don&rsquo;t neglect either of these. But, for Jindal, there is no distinction between the two as the issue concerns her deeply and personally. &ldquo;In terms of involvement and dedication, this is very different from setting up a hospital or launching 10 schools. I am giving others a hope for a better life,&rdquo; she sums up.&nbsp;</p>', 'How Jindal SAW managing director Sminu Jindal is championing the cause of accessibility for the disabled', '9', '', 0, '', 'seeking-incredible-and-accessible-india-75', 70, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Seeking incredible and accessible India', 'How Jindal SAW managing director Sminu Jindal is championing the cause of accessibility for the disabled', '', '', '', 'Jindal SAW,Sminu Jindal', 0, NULL, '2015-01-14 19:19:05', NULL, '2014-09-19', 0),

(77, 24, '', 'Business amateurism', '<p class="p1">Marketers love to revel in their cleverness and professionalism. They love recalling successful efforts at targeting consumers, extending brands, responding to customer need, benchmarking against competitors, and adopting scientific methods of analysis. They make no secret of their motivations either &mdash; they are there to make money and crush the competition. In contrast, authentic brands seem to be run by amateurs that reject customer research and marketing, in favor of gut feel, intuition, and craft techniques. Yet amateurs have some redeeming features. First, they are unpaid. Because of this, they usually do things because they want to. Second, they often think differently because of their lack of training. Third, they are unencumbered with concerns of fame, paying bills, and meeting next quarter&rsquo;s targets.</p>\n<p class="p2">A great example is Altoids &mdash; the popular brand of mints. In a remarkable example of corporate maturity, Claudia Kotchka (VP of Design at Procter and Gamble [P&amp;G]) identified why P&amp;G couldn&rsquo;t produce brands with the authenticity of Altoids. Recalling Snapple, Kotchka (2006) noted how Altoids brand authenticity would be destroyed by the &ldquo;P&amp;G effect.&rdquo; First to go would be the Altoids tin. Tin is more expensive than plastic, is heavier, is old fashioned, and the unique molded design is difficult and expensive to change in response to changing trends. Second to go would be the high-quality paper inside the tin that protects the mints from breaking. Third to go would be the flavors &mdash; after all, no market test would highlight mass interest in liquorice mints, ginger mints, and cinnamon mints. Fourth to go would be the strength of the mints themselves as this puts many people off. Finally, the shape and size of the mints would be standardized with new production processes because focus groups disliked their rough, seemingly hand-cut shape. Kotchka concluded that the result of this attempt to &ldquo;smooth out the edges&rdquo; of Altoids would be to destroy the product&rsquo;s value in the eyes of its customers (in fact, she labeled the new brand &ldquo;Proctoids&rdquo;).</p>\n<p class="p2">In-N-Out Burger provides another example of amateurism. This cult hamburger chain from Southern California charges low prices offers few items, produces everything fresh-to-order (and still hand cut fries), pays the highest wages in the fast food sector, and enjoys cult-like devotion among consumers. Despite having relatively few stores, high cost, and strong competition, In-N-Out Burger has some of the highest returns in the industry. Also, as a fast food provider, its burgers do not suffer the same poor-quality associations endured by other brands. And, in an industry where staff turnover is rampant, In-N-Out enjoys extremely high levels of loyalty (Moon, 2003). How has this seemingly, old time burger chain outperformed its lager, smarter, more customer-focused rivals? Simple &mdash; because it emphasises on old-fashioned things like quality, care for product and staff, friendly service, and community. In-N-Out is not successful in spite of its lack of professionalism; rather its very amateurism gives the brand its charm as well as a focus on what really matters &mdash; taste and service.</p>\n<p class="p2">Although these brands seem amateurish, don&rsquo;t take this as evidence the people running them have no commercial understanding.

So much so that the designer plans to launch a similar collection for younger customers as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Manufacturing this collection is expensive and time consuming. But the response is encouraging" - Anita Dongre, designer and owner of AND Designs</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In addition to retail apparel biggies, local organic cotton manufacturing companies are venturing into the eco-friendly segment. Tamil Nadu-based Appachi Ecologic, for instance, works with organic cotton farmers and weavers for its apparel brand, Ethicus. Launched in 2009, the brand offers handloom sarees, t-shirts and baby clothes made from organic cotton, natural dyes and ahimsa silk certified by the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS). It also exports yarn and garments to Japan and Europe under the Ecologic brand. Says Vijayalakshmi Nachiar, director, Ethicus, &ldquo;We have seen a 100% increase in sales since our inception.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">The increasing awareness of green clothing has led to the launch of several brands such as No Nasties, Indigreen, Bhu:sattva and Samtana, and also tempted smaller export companies to turn their eyes to the domestic market. &ldquo;We have been exporting organic apparel through our company Organic &amp; More to western markets for over a decade. We decided to test the Indian market seeing the considerable demand here. Sales keep increasing every season,&rdquo; says Vickram Kumar, director, sales and marketing, Nino Bambino, which specialises in children&rsquo;s clothing and launched in India in January 2013. Starting with a consignment of 4,000 pieces, the brand now produces over 16,000 garments in each production cycle.</p>\n<p class="p3">Another exporter turned domestic brand is Do U Speak Green, launched in 2010, which makes clothes from organic cotton, eucalyptus fibre and recycled polyester. Says founder Shishir Goenka, &ldquo;We have been exporting eco-friendly fabrics for Western markets since 2007 and realised there is potential for such a collection in India as well. Besides, I was keen on making my small contribution towards environment sustainability. &rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Most new players in the green clothing line sell online to tech-savvy consumers. Nino Bambino, Gron Stockholm and Do U Speak Green&rsquo;s collections can be found on most popular e-retail sites, but many of them are now setting up brick-and-mortar shops or tying up with local distributors in the metros as well. For instance, Nino Bambino has tied up with distributors in Mumbai, Delhi, Ranchi and Gujarat, Gron Stockholm has three franchise stores in and around Delhi, while Ethicus has tied up with 40 boutiques across India.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>The clothing conundrum</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">It&rsquo;s not an easy business, though. A major issue faced by organic labels in India is establishing authenticity. Certification bodies and audit organisations sound a note of caution in this regard. &ldquo;It is important to differentiate between self-declarations about water use and organic cotton and a genuine, third-party certificate,&rdquo; says Sumit Gupta, India representative, GOTS.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The process doesn&rsquo;t come cheap. Nino Bambino pays #2.5 lakh as annual fee for its two manufacturing units, while Do U Speak Green pays &euro;2,000 a year. &ldquo;We pay such a high price because the firms we export to compel us to comply by stringent standards,&rdquo; says Goenka, adding that 80% of the company&rsquo;s stock is still for the export market.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Shop for a cause- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The bigger challenge is of price &mdash; organic clothing is by and large a premium offering, and the prices usually reflect that. While many manufacturers, including Gron Stockholm and Do U Speak Green, say they keep their prices on par with conventional cotton apparel, the fact remains that price remains a substantial hurdle, whether real or perceived. GOTS&rsquo; Gupta, though, thinks there are more serious issues to be tackled: &ldquo;Availability of certified organic garments and consumer awareness are bigger issues than the cost in Indian retail.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s probably why, while large exporters such as Arvind, Gokuldas and Alok Industries all work with organic cotton, it&rsquo;s mainly for overseas markets. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been making eco-friendly apparel for over three years now, but local demand is still very low so we focus on export markets,&rdquo; agrees Raj Kapur, head of marketing, Arvind Mills. Perhaps the large players will be inspired by the numbers the small guys are quoting. Nino Bambino predicts a 75% increase in sales this year from Rs 25 lakh in 2013 to Rs 1.1 crore. Gron Stockholm says it has witnessed a 70-75% increase in sales for the summer collection this year compared with last year, and Ethicus clocked a turnover of Rs 5 crore in FY13, compared with its modest beginning of Rs 10 lakh back in 2009. It&rsquo;s a small beginning, but who knows, green may well become the new black.&nbsp;</p>', 'Organic apparel sounds fancy for sure but is yet to gain critical mass in India', '13', '', 0, '', 'figuring-it-out-80', 75, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Figuring it out', 'Organic apparel sounds fancy for sure but is yet to gain critical mass in India', '', '', '', 'Organic apparel,Eco-friendly clothing,Levis'',Gron Stockholm,AND Designs,Appachi Ecologic,Nino Bambino,Ethicus', 0, NULL, '2015-01-15 12:32:32', '2015-01-15 12:46:16', '2014-08-22', 0);

(82, 12, '', 'A double topping for growth', '<p class="p1">The first customers were the British in pre-Independence Delhi, who queued up at Kwality in Connaught Place&rsquo;s Inner Circle for a cupful of Iqbal Ghai and Pishori Lamba&rsquo;s hand-churned ice cream. As the years went by, even as Kwality and Gaylord restaurants became renowned for their food, it was the ice cream sold under the same brands that was the real commercial success &mdash; so much so that Kwality became generic for ice-cream for several generations of Delhiites.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The association with Kwality ended in 1998 when Ravi Ghai, Iqbal&rsquo;s son and the second-generation businessman in the family, sold all marketing rights to Hindustan Lever (HLL) &mdash; but, by then, there were so many extended family-run offshoots and copycats that HLL allegedly had to buy the rights to the brand multiple times. Still, the Ghais&rsquo; connection with ice cream has continued &mdash; their Graviss group of companies has been the exclusive master franchisee for Baskin Robbins ice cream in India since 1993. There&rsquo;s also a joint venture with the US-based Rich Products to make non-dairy toppings for the bakery and food service industries.</p>\n<p class="p3">Last year, Graviss quietly stepped outside its comfort zone into the frozen yoghurt and meat business. The company acquired two Mumbai-based start-ups, 6th Street Yogurt and Meats and More, in January and May 2013, respectively, for undisclosed sums. While 6th Street Yogurt is aimed at the youth and health-conscious, Meats and More is positioned as a neighbourhood delicatessen store catering to everyday needs related to fresh and frozen meats and assorted snacks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an experiment that dovetails perfectly with Graviss&rsquo; existing portfolio,&rdquo; says Sanjay Coutinho, a long-time Graviss hand who rejoined the company in 2012 as CEO after a brief stint as CEO of Barista Coffee. &ldquo;The acquisitions have helped us synergise since all businesses are in the food and beverages space. 6th Street Yogurt forms part of the group&rsquo;s resolve to tap into the growing quick service restaurant (QSR) space, positioned as a deli store catering to nuclear families. Through Meats and More, we are tapping into the growing specialty organised retail category,&rdquo; he explains.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Catching a trend</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">It was in the summer of 2011 and Asif Rizvi, who was then working as a sales executive with Hewlett Packard, was strolling down the historic Sixth Street in Austin, the nerve centre of the Texas city&rsquo;s entertainment district, when the idea of getting into the frozen yoghurt business struck him. Rizvi shared the idea with his childhood friend, 26-year-old Zeeshan Kazi, who was a marketing manager with brand consulting firm DY Works back in Mumbai. A year later, the duo set up the first outlet of 6th Street Yogurt in Mumbai&rsquo;s Kemp&rsquo;s Corner in February 2012. By the time the company sold out to Graviss the following year, it had opened six more outlets, all of which offered yoghurt with toppings, smoothies, waffles and parfaits ranging from Rs 59 to Rs 280 with an additional Rs 25-35 per topping.</p>\n<p class="p3">Meats and More, on the other hand, is the brainchild of Jai Kacherla. The store had a very low-key launch in May 2011 in Powai, a central Mumbai suburb, before expanding to Oshiwara in July 2013. It sells a variety of fresh, frozen, imported and exotic meats such as rabbit, quail, turkey, salmon and emu, as well as breads and salad dressings ranging between Rs 150 and Rs 2,400 per kg.</p>\n<p class="p3">While the company is looking at high street locations for 6th Street Yogurt, residential locations will be the catchment area for Meats and More. Over the next year, the company plans to open five more yoghurt stores, investing around Rs 20 lakh per store on rent and fit-outs. It will spend an additional Rs 30 lakh on advertising and promotional activities. It is also experimenting with a caf&eacute; format, where customers will be served coffee and sandwiches in addition to yoghurts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Meats and More, too, will add three more stores by 2015, spending Rs 20-25 lakh per store. &ldquo;All these expansion plans will be financed through internal accruals,&rdquo; says Coutinho, adding that the company does not need external funding. He declines to share financial details but according to filings with the Registrar of Companies, Graviss Foods reported a revenue of Rs 71 crore and PAT of Rs 2.65 crore in FY13. Expansion after this initial company-financed push will be through the franchise route, which is familiar territory for Graviss &mdash; 524 of Baskin Robbins&rsquo; stores in India are run by Graviss. With the two new businesses, Graviss is now aiming at a top line growth of 15% in the current fiscal. But then growth won&rsquo;t come easy.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Sizing up the potential</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Working in niche categories is always a challenge, something that Coutinho too acknowledges. &ldquo;We have the mom-and-pop cold storages and unorganised markets to tackle for Meats and More. We are trying to understand the customers in residential areas around our stores,&rdquo; he says. The meats business has to grapple with lack of awareness among customers and novelty of the concept but the potential is impressive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In the case of yoghurt, the domestic market is estimated at around Rs 1,000 crore, comprising organised packaged yoghurt, its varieties and packaged drinks, and growing 20% per annum, according to Technopak. Not surprising then that there are several frozen yoghurt chains in Mumbai, including Pinkberry, Cocoberry, Yogurtbay, Let&rsquo;s Go Froyo, Sugardaddy, Yoforia and Kiwi Kiss. But given that players like Sugardaddy and Let&rsquo;s Go Froyo have already shut shops, is the city big enough to sustain so many yoghurt chains?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Devangshu Dutta, CEO of retail consulting firm Third Eyesight, feels that Graviss will have to differentiate itself from competitors in the yoghurt ice cream and meat spaces as consumers slowly warm up to exotic ventures. &ldquo;To make a mark, Graviss will have to snatch away market share from the likes of Cocoberry, London Dairy or Haagen-Dazs,&rdquo; adds Dutta.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"To make a mark, Graviss will have to snatch away market share from the likes of Cocoberry, London Dairy or Haagen-Dazs&rdquo; - Devangshu Dutta, CEO, Third Eyesight</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">So, how does Graviss plan to tackle the situation? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still a nascent category. We want to get the model and the back-end right,&rdquo; says Coutinho. To begin with, the staff is being trained in the art of selling and other soft skills and surprise audits are being conducted for accurate feedback. The other aspect that Graviss wants to focus is on the look and feel of stores, a marked change from the dingy and crowded neighbourhood abattoir and poultry shops. &ldquo;We want people to walk into bright, well-lit stores that have a youthful and fun look and feel,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In the case of frozen yoghurt, Coutinho is ready to experiment a bit more with the brand. &ldquo;As we are investing more and increasing consumption points for our new brands, the 6th Street Yogurt brand will soon broaden out,&rdquo; mentions Coutinho. To begin with, 6th Street Yogurt&rsquo;s menu has been expanded to include flavours such as cranberry and green apple, and co-founder Kazi has come on board as vice-president, business development. &ldquo;While the company has just piloted ice-cream roll cakes, it plans to come out with ice cream beverages too,&rdquo; says Coutinho.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Meanwhile, the company is also working on building the brand and educating customers through social media and local store marketing. Since 6th Street Yogurt targets young customers, it has partnered with a design consultancy, DY Works, for creating new brand identities for both companies. For 6th Street Yogurt, DY Works suggested a brand core of &lsquo;medley of good times&rsquo;. &ldquo;6th Street Yogurt stands for new experiences and tastes, where friends could connect over indulgent servings of frozen yoghurt. The strong, focused brand essence helps establish its unique place among consumers in a category of big players,&rdquo; says Alpana Parida, president, DY Works. Similarly, Meats n More will work on the &lsquo;sommelier of meats&rsquo; proposition, to showcase the wide variety. &ldquo;The brand is strategically placed to occupy a middle ground. It offers superior hygiene and quality compared with traditional butcher shops and stands out in comparison with supermarkets through its personal connect and customisation options,&rdquo; Parida adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The focused brand essence of 6th Street Yogurt helps establish its unique place among customers in a category of big players" - Alpana Parida, president, DY Works</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Since the meat business in India is largely unorganised, Coutinho believes the challenge is more about sensitising customers about the hygiene factor. &ldquo;People are often not willing to pay a premium for clean and well-packaged meat,&rdquo; points Coutinho. Hence, while the company is investing in understanding its customers around the residential areas in which its stores are located, it is also trying to woo them with a hygienic and fresh ambience in its stores, home delivery services, etc. With the new look and feel, the company believes this meat business concept will resonate with working couples that are always on the run.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While the potential sounds huge, the going will be far from easy for Graviss. According to Crisil Research, the QSR market is expected to double to around Rs 7,000 crore in 2015-16 from Rs 3,400 crore in 2012-13, driven largely by store additions. However, during this period, same-store sales growth is expected to decline considerably due to intensifying competition in tier 1 cities, coupled with the economic slowdown. Harish Bijoor, CEO of Harish Bijoor Consultancy, says, &ldquo;Graviss&rsquo; two new businesses are more of modern retail and high street brands. Their success will depend on Graviss&rsquo; ability to pump in more money so as to create a bigger brand pull out of these two local entities.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Coutinho is not too perturbed about the future of the two new brands. &ldquo;These are still early days for us to get the business model right. Our approach is to create entrepreneurs through a franchisee-led model by giving them the flexibility to go full throttle, the way I have in growing the business,&rdquo; sums up Coutinho. Whether that leeway results in another winner beyond Baskin Robbins for the Ghais will only be evident in the time to come.&nbsp;</p>', 'Meats and flavoured yoghurt are the new additions in the portfolio of Graviss Foods, the Indian franchise of Baskin Robbins', '10', '', 0, '', 'a-double-topping-for-growth-82', 77, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'A double topping for growth', 'Meats and flavoured yoghurt are the new additions in the portfolio of Graviss Foods, the Indian franchise of Baskin Robbins', '', '', '', 'Graviss Foods,Baskin Robbins,6th Street Yogurt,Meats and More,Frozen yogurt', 0, NULL, '2015-01-15 13:11:48', '2015-01-16 11:46:39', '2014-08-22', 0),
(81, 12, '', 'Not sticking to the script', '<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s hard to forget Ashok Goel, especially once he hands you his business card. The &lsquo;card&rsquo; is a yellow sticky note, with a caricature of him doffing a hat and details of his company in what appear to be scribbles and doodles in pencil. Actually, it is a carefully crafted way of standing out in the crowd of branding and advertising agencies in India. &ldquo;The tagline of our company is &lsquo;Ideas that stick&rsquo; and we thought this would be a great way of conveying that,&rdquo; says the 50-year-old co-founder of Delhi-based creative agency Glue Brandworks. It&rsquo;s not the first time Goel has tried an offbeat idea that&rsquo;s worked out well. Indeed, for the past 14 years, he has made a business out of quirky, unconventional thinking with his companies, Gauge Advertising and Glue Brandworks.</p>\n<p class="p3">An ad industry veteran who worked with blue-chip agencies such as TBWA, McCann, Trikaya Grey, Lintas and HTA, Goel started his first agency, Gauge Advertising, in 2000. He teamed up with his snooker buddies Pawan Chohan and Surender Keswani and the three friends pooled in Rs 10 lakh from their personal savings to launch the agency. The idea from the start was clear: Goel and Co would <em>not</em> do business as usual. Instead of building a brand by tom-tomming its pluses to an outside audience of customers and suppliers, Gauge decided to focus on internal or B2E (business to employee) communication. &ldquo;We are a people engagement agency. Employees are the biggest brand ambassadors of an organisation and keeping them happy and satisfied contributes greatly to the organisation&rsquo;s image,&rdquo; Goel explains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Focusing on the IT and ITES segments, Gauge typically works with large companies with over 10,000 employees. &ldquo;It makes sense for a company to invest in professional communication and get value for money if there is a large base. It makes even more sense when the company has a multi-city presence because then it is the communication that binds people,&rdquo; says Goel. Gauge currently has over 30 clients, including big companies such as IBM, Wipro, Deutsche Bank and Concentrix in the B2E vertical, capitalised billings of over Rs 21.5 crore in FY13 and an estimated revenue of Rs 26 crore in FY14.</p>\n<p class="p3">So, what does Gauge do? Its work starts from designing a brand strategy, internal communication across all three stages of employee lifecycle (acquisition, retention and attrition) as well as reaching out to channel and business partners. Tailor-made solutions include referral campaigns, communication for campus hires, helping in orientation of new hires and planning special days for organisations (such as family days, town hall meetings etc.). &ldquo;All these campaigns are ultimately aimed at engaging employees to drive the business objectives while lowering attrition rates,&rdquo; says Pawan Chohan, co-founder of Gauge and director, IT and digital domain. But why would companies be willing to shell out anywhere between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 60 lakh for a campaign that should be handled by the HR department? &ldquo;HR has moved from being a staff function to a sales function, where they are given targets of ensuring quality, participation etc. If HR has to continue this way, its communication would end up totally one-way. We believe in more creative and interesting ways of communication, which involve more engagement from the employee,&rdquo; says Goel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The approach seems to be working, going by customer testimonials. Blackberry India, where Gauge largely works on B2B communication and enterprise management, professes to be completely satisfied with Gauge&rsquo;s work over the past three years. &ldquo;We have seen y-o-y growth in our customer base as well as more awareness for our solutions in the market today. Our choice of agency was based on Gauge&rsquo;s understanding of our portfolio. At the end of the day, it came down to returns, which we have seen,&rdquo; says Manoj Khilnani, country marketing manager, enterprise products, Blackberry India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Working in the B2B and B2E space, Gauge wasn&rsquo;t doing much conventional advertising work. Last year, though, to keep pace with the industry, Goel saw the need to tap into the creative side of advertising and communication as well. This led to the launch of Glue Brandworks, a sister concern that functions as Gauge&rsquo;s core creative shop, and Goel roped in Gautam Mehta, who has previously worked with McCann Asia in Jakarta, as partner. Even with Glue, though, the accent is on not doing conventional work, explains Mehta. &ldquo;We believe it is important to put your money on ideas that will be memorable. We work with clients who are brave enough to step out and do things differently,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The agency has worked with clients such as start-up stockbroking company F6 Finserve, Zen mobile, Blackberry World, One Indiabulls and IBM. The ads are crisp and funny, something Goel attributes to sticking to the basics. &ldquo;Big agencies often ignore the obvious and go for heavy-duty research. Our ideas are very basic and they work because they come closer to your heart,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The company&rsquo;s most recent campaign, for the One Indiabulls housing project in Gurgaon, also stays away from conventional celeb endorsements, incentives and promotions. Instead, Glue&rsquo;s communication for the housing project (a Rs 40-crore account) focuses on an &lsquo;Old World charm&rsquo; theme, using the opulence and extravagance of the colonial lifestyle to highlight project features.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With revenue of Rs 1.5 crore in its first year, Glue is a very small minnow in the Rs 32,600-crore advertising industry. But Goel isn&rsquo;t worried. &ldquo;Our approach is different and leaves no room for comparison,&rdquo; he says insouciantly. It may be a while before Gauge and Glue become as ubiquitous as the sticky notes Goel distributes as visiting cards but meanwhile, they&rsquo;re certainly sticking out of the crowd.&nbsp;</p>', 'How Glue Brandworks and Gauge Advertising want to reinvigorate the staid ad industry with their ideas ', '15', '', 0, '', 'not-sticking-to-the-script-81', 76, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Not sticking to the script', 'How Glue Brandworks and Gauge Advertising want to reinvigorate the staid ad industry with their ideas ', '', '', '', 'Glue Brandworks,Gauge Advertising,Ashok Goel,B2E Communication', 0, NULL, '2015-01-15 12:41:40', '2015-01-15 12:49:27', '2014-08-22', 0),
(83, 16, '', 'Keep calm and sell assets', '<p class="p1">Talk about biting off more than you can chew. In April 2009, at the peak of the global economic crisis, Manoj Gaur announced that the Jaypee Group would invest a Rs 10,000 crore over the next year across its power, infrastructure and cement businesses. The plan was to execute as many as five thermal power projects of 660 MW each, apart from two greenfield projects in the power sector. The cement business was also looking to increase its capacity of 13.5 million tonne per annum (mtpa) to 23 mtpa in the first phase and eventually to 35 mtpa. Gaur, the group&rsquo;s executive chairman, was banking on easy access to funds and the belief that the economy would rebound quickly.</p>\n<p class="p3">Fast forward a few years and, clearly, things didn&rsquo;t pan out quite as planned. The money did come through, but with the lacklustre economy playing spoilsport, the anticipated growth remained on paper. The result: Jaypee&rsquo;s debt at its peak soared to a staggering Rs 60,000 crore. Since last year, it has been frantically disposing off assets across in a bid to bring down that number. In September 2013, Jaypee Cement sold a 4.8-mtpa unit in Gujarat to Aditya Birla Group company UltraTech. This was followed by the sale of the 74% holding in Bokaro Jaypee Cement to Dalmia Cement for #690 crore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">More recently, Reliance Power entered into an agreement to buy three hydroelectric power plants owned by Jaiprakash Power Ventures for an estimated Rs 12,000 crore. In early March, a consortium of investors led by TAQA, an Abu Dhabi-based energy and utilities company, along with Indo-Infra and IDFC Alternatives, agreed to acquire two of these plants for Rs 10,320 crore, but the deal fell through. The firm has an operational capacity of 1,800 MW with an asset base of Rs 10,000 crore and will add to the 5,000-MW capacity that Reliance Power is developing in hydroelectric power. &ldquo;Hydroelectric power is a defensive asset since there are no supply risks. It helps Reliance diversify its thermal portfolio and the cost of power generation is lower,&rdquo; says Bharanidhar Vijayakumar, analyst at Spark Capital. Reliance Power plans to raise Rs 9,500 crore as debt and infuse another Rs 2,500 crore as equity to fund the acquisition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">If it&rsquo;s any consolation, the Jaypee Group isn&rsquo;t alone. Several high-profile Indian corporate houses, including GMR, the UB Group, Bharti Airtel and Videocon, are desperately looking to offload assets and reduce some of their debt as they realise there will be no bailouts and banks are no longer evergreening their loans. Meanwhile, it&rsquo;s bonanza time for the buyers as they pick up good assets at sound valuations. As India Inc looks set to shed more debt in the coming year, they will see even more deals up for grabs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Shedding light</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">A recent report by ratings agency Crisil says that over the past 18 months, 21 domestic companies have announced 36 deals that will raise a total Rs 78,900 crore, trimming their debt by nearly 20% <em>(see: Desperate times call for tough measures)</em>. The forecast is that companies will raise another Rs 60,000 crore during the current fiscal. According to Manish Gupta, director, Crisil Ratings, asset sales are a way for companies to survive the slowdown. &ldquo;They are refocusing on their core business and reducing high levels of debt on their balance sheet,&rdquo; he explains. This debt, thinks Gupta, was the result of aggressive expansion and diversification and met through debt funding, which was followed by the economy slowing down. &ldquo;High interest costs were accompanied by low operating Ebitda margins and delays in project closures.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The slowdown has thrown up several opportunities in the form of stressed assets, says MV Seshagiri Rao, group CFO and joint MD, JSW Steel, adding that they must make strategic sense to the buyer. &ldquo;In a greenfield project, the process of land acquisition and environmental clearance could take as much as a decade, which means project costs go haywire. An existing asset does not come with any of this baggage and makes good business sense,&rdquo; he points out.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Desperate times call for tough measures- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In May 2013, JSW Steel acquired Heidelberg Cement India&rsquo;s 6 mtpa grinding facility in Maharashtra for an undisclosed amount. The seller said this was a less strategic asset with lower margins and thought it more important to expand capacity in central India. For Rao, low returns weren&rsquo;t as important as checking if the risk factors were &ldquo;under control&rdquo;. &ldquo;This helped our cement foray,&rdquo; he thinks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Given the shape of the economy, it should come as no surprise that core sectors are seeing the maximum asset sell-offs. Crisil&rsquo;s analysis shows that as much as Rs 48,800 crore &mdash; 62% of what has been raised &mdash; has come from firms in the beleaguered infrastructure sector. In March 2013, GMR Energy sold its 70% holding in its Singapore operation to FPM Power Holdings for $660 million (Rs 2,650 crore). Madhu Terdal, group CFO, GMR Group, points to the need for capital for the group&rsquo;s upcoming projects in the domestic market. &ldquo;There were limited opportunities in India to raise capital due to poor sentiments. Besides, a large part of risks associated with the project were already mitigated,&rdquo; he says, about the rationale for exiting this investment. This deal was followed by GMR Infrastructure selling its 40% stake in Istanbul International Airport for $310 million (Rs 1,740 crore) to Malaysia Airport Holdings Berhad, reducing its debt from a very sizeable Rs 40,000 crore.</p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s clearly a distress sale for debt-ridden companies, especially in the infra space, but what explains the buyers? After all, it is one thing to be optimistic about a stable government and change in sentiments but another to invest $300 million to $1 billion. &ldquo;What seems cheap today could be 40% cheaper if things worsen, so companies need to take a calculated risk even if there are bargain buys all around,&rdquo; says the head of equity strategy at a foreign brokerage. Most firms have strategic reasons for buying assets, from increasing their presence in new markets and becoming market leaders to diversifying their revenue streams and thereby, overall risk. Besides, picking up existing assets in infra means most risks are mitigated as all the approvals are in, resulting in a shorter payback period.</p>\n<p class="p3">Having burnt their fingers during the slowdown, companies are now taking measured steps when it comes to buying assets or investing in projects. That&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing as it was the greed to get their hands on as many assets as possible that got the sellers into trouble in the first place. Financial investors, too, are waiting for the dust to settle. &ldquo;We would like clarity on issues related to coal block reallocations and road construction. If that happens, it will make a big difference to the sentiment,&rdquo; says MK Sinha, managing partner and CEO, IDFC Alternatives. Sinha says that currently, there is a transition from complete disappointment to a pace of good investment climate. &ldquo;We realise that it is important to be patient since the upside looks attractive. As a fund, we will continue to invest more capital in the time to come,&rdquo; he adds, expecting the overall investment climate to take six to eight months to pick up. IDFC Alternatives is one of the few PE firms that invest in the infrastructure space. Its India Infrastructure Fund picked up a 74% stake in GMR Ulundurpet Expressways for Rs 222 crore in September 2013. The investee firm operates a 73-km road project that forms a part of NH45 in Tamil Nadu.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"As an investor, we realise it is important to be patient since the upside looks attractive" - MK Sinha, managing partner and CEO, IDFC Alternatives</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">There aren&rsquo;t too many PE funds like IDFC Alternatives. Deals such as KKR&rsquo;s Rs 750-crore investment in Dalmia Cement and Barings Private Equity Asia&rsquo;s Rs 1,400-crore investment in Lafarge India were exceptions. Ajay Relan, founder and managing partner, CX Partners, says PE funds in India typically focus on a narrow band of sectors, such as consumer products, IT, ITES and healthcare services. &ldquo;PE funds are more likely to invest in firms that have an asset-light model since their return ratios in these sectors are far more attractive,&rdquo; he says. That explains his firm&rsquo;s acquisition, along with Capital Square Partners, of Minacs, the Aditya Birla Group&rsquo;s BPO arm, earlier this year for Rs 1,400 crore. &ldquo;It was a non-core asset for the seller. The AV Birla Group will not divest its stake in financial services, which is what PE funds are really interested in,&rdquo; Relan adds, with a laugh.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"PE funds are likely to invest in asset-light companies since the return ratios are more attractive" - Ajay Relan, managing partner, CX Partners</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Then, while several proposals may have been evaluated, many fell through on valuation differences. &ldquo;PE firms are asking for significant discount on valuations and the promoters aren&rsquo;t willing to sell at that price,&rdquo; says the head of equity strategy quoted earlier. Since most of them are financial investors who don&rsquo;t want to get into operations, the price they buy at becomes important.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s perhaps one of the reasons why Nandan Chakraborty, MD, institutional research, Axis Capital, thinks PEs may not make big bang investments in infrastructure anytime soon. He believes it makes better sense for large business groups such as the Tatas and Birlas, which have companies with strong balance sheets, to diversify into the infra space. &ldquo;It is a great time to buy into the sector as there will be many more distressed assets coming up for sale,&rdquo; he says. Being a strategic investor rather than financial investor in the infrastructure space could mean a two-fold gain, where you can further improve the overall returns by executing projects better. JSW Steel&rsquo;s Rao says companies that have been conservative will continue to have healthy cash flows and manageable debt-equity ratios. &ldquo;They will continue to buy assets as long as it makes sense with their existing businesses,&rdquo; he explains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Companies that have been conservative will continue to buy assets if it makes business sense" - MV Seshagiri Rao, group CFO and JMD, JSW Steel</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">With the PM wooing Japanese and Chinese investors to fund projects, infra companies have more than one option to choose from for their asset sales. The funds raised from the sales will give some of them a much-needed lifeline till the macro environment improves. The hope is that with a new government at the helm, policy decisions will be faster and projects will be far more viable to fund.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Waiting it out</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Of course, there&rsquo;s also the issue of how expensive asset sales are: a booming stock market has already added a twist to the story. &ldquo;Yes, valuations are looking up over the past couple of months. We may see even a further upside with sellers of non-core assets recognising a scarcity issue and potential buyers putting in higher bids for assets that are critical to them,&rdquo; thinks Gopal Khetan, head (M&amp;A advisory), HSBC India. Still, while companies in the IT or pharma space &mdash; where India has developed some significant expertise &mdash; could command premium valuations, infrastructure assets are likely to come at reasonable valuations given that many of them are using these assets as an extended lifeline.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">For now, buyers will emerge in various forms &mdash; strategic domestic or overseas firms &mdash; depending on the nature of the asset. They are all banking on India recovering and their investments bearing fruit over time. As Siddhartha Nigam, partner, Grant Thornton Advisory, puts it, &ldquo;In India, the growth story is inevitable, though there is still some pain left.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>&mdash;With inputs from Kripa Mahalingam</strong></p>', 'Following the slowdown, a host of Indian companies are selling assets to find a way out of a debt quagmire', '7', '', 0, '', 'keep-calm-and-sell-assets-83', 78, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Keep calm and sell assets', 'Following the slowdown, a host of Indian companies are selling assets to find a way out of a debt quagmire', '', '', '', 'Asset sales,Jaypee Group,GMR,UB Group,Aditya Birla Group', 0, NULL, '2015-01-15 13:42:38', NULL, '2014-08-22', 0),

The Renuka Ramnath-floated Multiples Private Equity Fund, which had picked up over 13% stake in the company at Rs 245 a share in the same year through a preferential allotment, has part encashed on the rally in the stock. Multiples sold 935,000 shares (2.27%) on July 4 in the open market, netting gains of Rs 39 crore based on the selling price of Rs 662. As on date, the PE fund holds over 12% stake in the company.

(85, 20, '', 'Hot and happening', '<p class="p1">What does the picture on the Street look like, 207 days and 142 trading sessions since the year began? While the benchmark Sensex has delivered an average 19% return from January 2014 to July 23, the BSE mid-cap index has delivered an average 27% over the same period. But the broad picture camouflages the disparate return of individual stocks within these indices. Considering a hypothetical investment scenario, the outcome would have been stunningly different if an investor had pumped in about Rs 1 lakh in the best performing Sensex stock and a similar sum in the top mid-cap gainer. While the top Sensex performer would have fetched a gain of Rs 58,000, the mid-cap stock would have dished up a mind-boggling return of Rs 2,22,500. And which are these two stocks? Hindalco from the 30-share Sensex and Amtek Auto from the 239-scrip BSE mid-cap index that gained 58% and 225%, respectively, during the period mentioned.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Consider this: while the top 13 Sensex stocks gave returns of between 30% and 58% and 11 stocks gained between 10% and 30%, in the case of mid-caps, eight stocks fetched between 160% and 225% return, 17 stocks gained between 100% and 141% and over 62 stocks generated returns upwards of 50% to about 100%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Against such a backdrop, it would be only fair to assume that mid-caps will lose steam fast compared with the Sensex, in the near term. But that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case. For instance, at current levels, while the Sensex is up over 25% from its 2008 peak of 21,000, the mid-cap index, in contrast, is down 11% from its comparative peak of 10,245, which effectively means that mid-caps have underperformed their large-cap peers by almost 36%. The difference is stark in terms of valuations too. The mid-cap index is trading at around 13 times its trailing earnings, almost 70% lower than Sensex&rsquo;s valuation of 19 times.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Mixed bag- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Though the market has been largely lacklustre since the Budget, market pundits believe that the gap in valuations will shrink. &ldquo;As the sentiment turns from lacklustre to bullish, there is a possibility of the valuation gap shrinking,&rdquo; opines Ajay Bodke, head, investment strategy and advisory, Prabhudas Lilladher. If this re-rating coincides with earnings growth, mid-caps could actually give good returns.</p>\n<p class="p3">But it may not be easy to find a bargain among mid-caps, as most of them have to start showing results to justify their valuations. In other words, mid-caps are more vulnerable in case of a sharp correction in the market. &ldquo;The risk in mid-caps is higher as there are apprehensions on their ability to cope in a challenging business environment,&rdquo; adds Bokade. Besides, many stocks have run ahead of their fundamentals. Amtek Auto, PMC Fincorp, National Buildings Construction (NBCC) and IRB Infra were the highest gainers, with over 180% return YTD.</p>\n<p class="p3">It is not surprising that analysts are selectively bullish. Kamlesh Kotak, head of research at Amsec Securities, says, &ldquo;Though mid-caps have been on the boil, there are quite a few names that are potentially sound investments.&rdquo; Finolex Cable, KSB Pumps, Ahluwalia Contracts, Astra Microwave Products and Orient Refractories top the buy list at Amsec. &ldquo;Strong business prospects along with a sound balance sheet and promoter reputation are what make these names noteworthy,&rdquo; justifies Kotak.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">What about the top rankers in the current rally? Nomura remains bullish on Amtek because it believes the company is well placed to benefit from a revival in the domestic passenger vehicle industry. In the case of government-owned NBCC, analysts feel the company, with a Rs 1,200-crore plus cash pile and a Rs 16,000-crore order-book, has a lot going for it.

(86, 16, '', 'Doing well by doing good', '<p class="p1">It is just past noon on a hot summer day in Thesgora village, central India, but surprisingly, the classroom in the local government primary school is in complete darkness. The windows and door are shut tight and inside, some 40 students shield their eyes from the intense light of a powerful torch. The beam travels across each student&rsquo;s hands and as it zooms in on 10-year-old Sheetal, she joyfully exclaims, &ldquo;<em>Kitanu nahin hai</em> (There are no germs).&rdquo; A moment later, the windows are opened and the oppressive heat pours in with a vengeance. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Thesgora is about an hour&rsquo;s drive from Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh. It seems no different from any other village in India. Around 1,500 people live on both sides of a single, straight road and four <em>kirana</em> stores cater to the locals&rsquo; basic needs. But Thesgora <em>is</em> different &mdash; it has the dubious distinction of having one of the highest rates of diarrhoea among children worldwide. Two million children below five years die every year across the world from diarrhoea and pneumonia. In Thesgora, 36% of children under 12 have been affected with the same. But those numbers have been improving in the past two years. Where villagers seemed unaware of the extent of the problem earlier, they now speak of the need for maintaining hygiene and adopting clean habits.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>HUL''s - Image</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Once a week, a woman volunteer accompanied by four young men visits homes in the village and speaks to families about the need to wash their hands with soap on five different occasions every day (such as before eating and after using the toilet). The conversation is light-hearted and playful, especially when speaking with children. They conduct quizzes and hand out stickers with caricatures of <em>kitanu</em> (germs) to winners. Hindustan Unilever (HUL), India&rsquo;s largest consumer products company, runs the entire exercise &mdash; its Lifebuoy brand is subtly present on all posters and stickers but never directly mentioned. The focus, instead, is on conveying a simple but powerful message &mdash; washing your hands goes a long way in ensuring basic sanitation and hygiene.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;The more good we do for society, the more good it does for our business. Our social mission has been integrated into our business model,&rdquo; says Samir Singh, global brand vice-president, Lifebuoy, at HUL. The Thesgora mission is part of a global initiative &mdash; Lifebuoy Help a Child Reach 5 &mdash; that has reached out to 180 million people in 16 countries. At Thesgora itself, HUL says diarrhoea levels dropped from 36% to 5% since the hand-washing programme was launched in 2012.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The more good we do for society, the better it is for business. Our mission has been integrated into our business model" - Samir Singh, global brand vice-president, Lifebuoy, HUL</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">There&rsquo;s been a positive impact on the brand as well. Gyanchand Sahu, who owns the largest <em>kirana</em> store in Thesgora, says he sells four boxes (320 units) of Lifebuoy every month. &ldquo;A year ago, we sold barely 40 units a month. Now, customers ask for Lifebuoy by name,&rdquo; says the 35-year-old, pointing behind him to an empty shelf where the soap is usually stocked.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Later in the day, Sahu will go to Chhindwara and bring back at least two boxes for restocking. &ldquo;This will also sell out very fast and I will need to get fresh stock soon,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Welcome to the world of cause-related marketing (CRM), where doing good often translates into great sales. Increasingly, Indian companies are finding that promoting a strong social message &mdash; such as sanitation, nutrition, education or women&rsquo;s empowerment &mdash; helps their own business fortunes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The term CRM was first used in 1983 in connection with an American Express initiative (indeed, the company holds the copyright on the term). Over a three-month period, the well-known credit card company set aside 1 cent from every card transaction and $1 every time someone applied for a new card; this money was donated to the Statue of Liberty Restoration Project. By the time the campaign ended, the restoration fund was richer by $1.7 million, Amex&rsquo;s usage was up 27% and there was a 17% increase in new users. There was also a loud and heated debate on the ethical aspects of CRM &mdash; after all, it essentially involves a brand piggybacking on a noble cause to up its own sales. But a whole new way of reaching out to consumers had been discovered and brand managers across the globe jumped at the idea.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Globally, cause-related marketing spend crossed $1.78 billion in 2013 and is projected to hit $1.84 billion this year. The story in India is still very small but it&rsquo;s also picking up steam.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Promotions with a purpose</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Why are companies turning to CRM? For starters, it&rsquo;s a great way of standing out in the clutter, especially given the increasing influence of socially aware and active consumers. Marketing experts also believe that associating with a good cause helps build customer loyalty and brand credibility.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">A 2013 study by Cone Communications found that, given comparable quality and price, a compelling 91% of consumers around the world are likely to switch brands to one associated with a good cause, while another study by Nielsen last year revealed that half of consumers worldwide would be willing to reward companies that give back to society by paying more for their goods and services.</p>\n<p class="p3">Here, it&rsquo;s important to distinguish between CRM and CSR. Although both involve corporate involvement in socially important issues, CRM activity is done with an eye on the bottomline, while CSR is purely philanthropic &mdash; handouts to NGOs are donations and grants under CSR, while they are expenses under CRM. Importantly, it is the company and not the consumer that bears the cost of the cause, although the unspoken assumption is that the cause will attract more customers and higher sales will offset the hit on margins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Jaago re- Image</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;CSR has always remained a marginal pursuit for companies and was restricted to a small mention in the annual report. CRM, on the contrary, has taken off in a bigger way as brands see an opportunity in linking themselves to social causes. It allows them to take a very clear position, which is associated with a strong cause. The expectation here is that it will increase sales,&rdquo; says Santosh Desai, an ad industry veteran and CEO and MD, Futurebrands.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"CSR has always remained a marginal pursuit for companies. CRM, ont the contrary, has taken off in a bigger way" - Santosh Desai, CEO and MD, Futurebrands</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">For proof, look no further than Tata Tea&rsquo;s iconic <em>Jaago re</em> campaign. While the brand was launched in 1983, it was this campaign &mdash; which started in 2007 &mdash; that triggered explosive growth in sales. <em>Jaago re</em> took up social activism, allowing the company to connect with issues such as voter registration, corruption and women&rsquo;s rights. &ldquo;In a category like tea, there is inertia at the consumers&rsquo; end and it is very important to be disruptive,&rdquo; says Vikram Grover, head, marketing, South Asia, Tata Global Beverages. So far, the brand has spent Rs 100 crore on the <em>Jaago re</em> campaign and another Rs 75 crore on plain vanilla brand communication. Tea drinkers certainly seem to have woken up to the company. Tata Global has several tea brands, including Gold, Chakra Gold, Agni and Kanan Devan, and the campaign, says Grover, brought them under one umbrella. Currently, Tata Global accounts for 22% of the Rs 12,000-crore branded tea market, ahead of HUL&rsquo;s 19.6%. Compare that with data before the campaign&rsquo;s launch: in 2007, HUL was the market leader with 21.5%, while Tata Global was the No.2 player with 18.7% market share. &ldquo;We were volume leaders in tea. Now, we are also the value leaders,&rdquo; Grover adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We were volume leaders in tea. Now, after the <em>Jaago re</em> campaign on social activism, we are also the value leaders" - Vikram Grover, head, marketing, South Asia, Tata Global Beverages</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">If Tata Tea can be considered the poster child of CRM in India, it also points to the two factors that determine the success of a CRM campaign &mdash; the choice of cause and the duration of the association. For the past seven years, the brand has stayed true to its <em>Jaago re</em> tagline, revisiting social causes time and again, tweaking them slightly to keep with the current mood &mdash; women&rsquo;s safety and the need to vote being the most recent and topical. &ldquo;We caught the trend very early in the day. Activism, we thought, had come of age,&rdquo; says Grover. In many ways, though, Tata Tea isn&rsquo;t the norm as it has embraced a general, catchall cause. Most brands usually select CRM causes that resonate with their product categories.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>Woman power</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Chand Begum looks blank when you ask her how old she is. She thinks hard and guesses she must be in her early to mid-40s. The mother of 10 has never been to school and until a year ago, was too busy trying to make ends meet to care &mdash; her husband is a casual labourer and his income is erratic at best. Now, Begum, a resident of Firozpur Jhirka village in Haryana, a two-hour drive from bustling Gurgaon, speaks passionately about how Coca-Cola India has changed her life. Thanks to the soft drink giant&rsquo;s 5by20 initiative, which aims to economically empower 5 million women entrepreneurs by 2020, people like Begum now earn at least Rs 4,500 a month. &ldquo;Some of my children are employed, but I contribute the most to running the house,&rdquo; she says, embarrassed but proud.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Coca-Cola India- Image</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">From the time 5by20 was rolled out in September 2010, it has already benefited 30,000 women in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, of which 20,000 are from India alone. &ldquo;Globally, by end 2013, we had already empowered 550,000 women,&rdquo; says Sonu Grover, director, strategic initiatives, Coca-Cola India and Southwest Asia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The initiative has proved a win-win for both Coke as well as its women entrepreneurs. According to Grover, the company reaches out to 2.2 million of the 8.5 million FMCG outlets in India. &ldquo;In many cases, expanding that has run into infrastructural hurdles, with power shortage being the biggest one,&rdquo; she explains. Keeping this in mind, the company&rsquo;s technicians came up with eKOcool, a solar-operated cooler that costs Rs 35,000. Coke distributes the cooler among selected rural women, who then sell its soft drinks from their small village stores. A village like Firozpur Jhirka is a perfect target since it never has more than five hours of power a day. Begum sells at least one crate of 24 bottles every day. &ldquo;So far, I&rsquo;ve earned Rs 55,000 from this business,&rdquo; says the woman who was doing odd jobs such as supplying ice before becoming a Coca-Cola retailer.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;The benefits have ranged from providing employment to women to entering untapped markets and increased sales for us,&rdquo; says Grover. So far, Coca-Cola India has supplied over 1,000 coolers across West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana &mdash; and seen a five-fold increase in sales from these markets. The plan, says Grover, is to cross 5,000 coolers in the next three to four years.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The benefits have ranged from providing employment to women to entering untapped markets and increased sales for us" - Sonu Grover, director, strategic initiatives, Coca-Cola India and Southwest Asia</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Causes involving women and children are popular with most consumer products companies and with good reason. The received wisdom is that women account for 75-85% of all purchase decisions, so reaching out in positive ways to this influential group through issues that resonate with them personally or with their families almost always works. It certainly has for Horlicks. In 2012, the milk additive brand kicked off <em>Ahaar abhiyan</em> as a pilot project in West Bengal: each time a consumer buys a Horlicks bottle priced at over Rs 100, the company contributes Re 1 towards tackling child malnutrition. Last year, the brand extended the initiative to Tamil Nadu and between the states, claims to have impacted the lives of nearly 18,000 children, having raised Rs 1.4 crore for the cause. It works with two NGOs &mdash; Care India and Save The Children &mdash; to handle deployment of funds. &ldquo;It was possible for us to make a direct contribution to the cause but since this was something new, we were not sure if the initiative would succeed. So, we started off in a small way. But the model is extremely scalable,&rdquo; says Jayant Singh, executive vice-president (marketing), GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, which owns the Horlicks brand.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Horlicks Ad- Image</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">About three months before the campaign was launched, GSK conducted a pilot in over 11,000 general trade stores in West Bengal, in addition to 12 hyperstores in Kolkata. &ldquo;There was a 14% lift in sales in the state. This confirmed a clear opportunity and a business proposition,&rdquo; says Singh. The choice of states was deliberate &mdash; West Bengal and Tamil Nadu are among Horlicks&rsquo; biggest markets, where it has over 75% market share. Horlicks&rsquo; share of the Rs 4,500-crore malted foods drink market has grown from 59% in 2008 to 64% in 2013. How much of that is on account of the CRM exercise is difficult to determine but Singh confirms that the two states where the campaign has been rolled out have seen higher volumes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"There was a 14% rise in sales in West Bengal. This confirmed a clear opportunity and a business proposition" - Jayant Singh, executive vice-president (marketing), GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Similarly, Google India has found that combining women empowerment and its core business of the internet is a winning proposition. Last November, the company launched the Helping Women Get Online project in Bhilwara, Rajasthan. The initiative works with Sewa Kendras to teach young girls and women in the 13-18 year age group who have smartphones the basics of using the internet for information and entertainment. &ldquo;There are at least 2 million households in India with internet connections that women have never used. This was low-hanging fruit,&rdquo; says Sandeep Menon, head of marketing, Google India. He adds that nearly 110,000 women in Bhilwara have already become internet-savvy as a result of this initiative. &ldquo;Over the next three to four months, we will enter Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh as well,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"There are at least 2 million households in India with net connections that women have never used. This was low-hanging fruit" - Sandeep Menon, head of marketing, Google India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The challenge here lays in monetising the initiative, which is the biggest marketing outreach programme undertaken by Google in India so far. Although Google does not push its own case while educating the girls, there&rsquo;s a very high probability that users will adopt its multiple services such as email, search engine, browser, YouTube etc. Getting people online means capturing their user profiles, which Google can use to pitch to advertisers. &ldquo;There are 140 million smartphone users in India and that number is only increasing. Targeting women is a clear demographic opportunity for us,&rdquo; says Menon.</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>Pick your cause</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">There&rsquo;s also a clear opportunity in targeting education in India and many brands opt for CRM projects around that, whether or not it relates to their product and core brand values. The results are usually positive, given how big an issue education is in the country. One of the first companies to hitch its wagon to the education trend was Procter &amp; Gamble, which launched Project Shiksha back in 2005. Since then, it has raised over Rs 22 crore for the cause, has reached out to almost 300,000 children and has been involved in building and supporting 140 schools across the country. Madhura Kapdi, general manager, resource mobilisation, CRY (the NGO that handles Project Shiksha for P&amp;G), explains that the objective was two-fold. &ldquo;It was to help business meet volume targets via the cause appealing to consumers, as well as to make a tangible difference by educating underprivileged children,&rdquo; she says. At P&amp;G, the impact was not so much in market share, since the initiative was at the company level, rather than for any one brand. But, sources say, overall sales increased five times, pointing to the effectiveness of the campaign.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Nihar- Image</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Insurance company Aviva India is also a votary of education as an effective CRM subject. In 2008, the company launched its &lsquo;Street to School&rsquo; initiative, which helps children get off the streets by giving them an education and training. The thought behind this global programme is &ldquo;education is insurance&rdquo;, says Rishi Pipariya, director, marketing and direct sales, Aviva India Life Insurance. In India, the company has partnered with CRY and Save The Children to facilitate education for underprivileged children and has increased its spend on the programme to almost 25% of overall marketing spend. &ldquo;We were a mid-sized player and wanted to be in a niche segment. The child space looked interesting since no company was really targeting young parents. Today, the child-related proposition brings in over half our sales, from 15-20% in 2008,&rdquo; Pipariya says.</p>\n<p class="p3">At Marico, too, focus on education has paid off in spades. For the past two years, the Mumbai-based FMCG company has run only a CRM campaign for its Nihar Naturals Shanti Amla brand of hair oil. The methodology is simple &mdash; 2% of the sales proceeds go towards funding the education of underprivileged children. All advertising and communication for the brand centres on the initiative &mdash; brand ambassador Vidya Balan&rsquo;s TV commercials speak of the social cause &mdash; and the usual, &lsquo;healthier hair&rsquo; message is almost given the go-by.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Sameer Satpathy, chief marketing officer, Marico, explains the insight for taking the CRM route: &ldquo;Women across strata in society are hugely invested in the education of children.&rdquo; Over 36,000 children in 10 states benefited in the first year of the programme and the aim now is to reach a total 50,000 by June 2015.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Associating with a good cause makes for very good business, apart from making ethical sense" - Sameer Satpathy, chief marketing officer, Marico&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Meanwhile, the brand has managed to clock some seriously good growth numbers over the same period. From a #112-crore brand in FY12, Nihar Naturals Shanti Amla has grown to Rs 185 crore by the following year and had sales of Rs 252 crore in FY14. &ldquo;Associating with a good cause makes for very good business, apart from making ethical sense,&rdquo; says Satpathy. The growth in sales has been accompanied by a surge in market share as well. The brand currently has a 30% volume share of the Rs 1,320-crore amla hair oil market, up from 18.6% in 2012 and 25.4% the following year &mdash; that&rsquo;s faster than the 7% growth registered by the category as a whole.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>In the public eye</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Where CRM helps established brands grow even faster, it has also proved useful in helping a newcomer stand out. In the US, Toms Shoes has stood out ever since its 2006 launch because of its promise to donate one pair of shoes to a poor child for every pair bought by customers. In the past seven or eight years, the company has given away more than 10 million pairs of new shoes and has expanded its One for One programme to include the company&rsquo;s new lines of products &mdash; eyewear (restoring sight to over 200,000 people) and coffee (donating a week of clean water for every bag of coffee purchased). &ldquo;Toms is a great example of a start-up that has grown significantly using CRM,&rdquo; says John Pracejus, associate professor, Alberta School of Business at Canada&rsquo;s University of Alberta, who has authored papers on the subject. &ldquo;Today, it is hard to imagine Toms Shoes without the CRM campaign.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">In India, too, when regional cellular operator Aircel decided to go national in 2008, it took the CRM route to increase brand recall and association in markets dominated by large players such as Airtel, Vodafone and Idea. Its cause of choice: tigers. The Save Our Tigers campaign broke in 2008 even as Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was signed on as brand ambassador. &ldquo;The tiger campaign helped us get noticed and to eventually create a series of on-ground activities, such as contests and merchandise,&rdquo; says Anupam Vasudev, chief marketing officer, Aircel. A tie-up with NDTV, involving celebrities such as Amitabh Bachchan and raising Rs 11 crore from donors such as a Hemendra Kothari, Uday Kotak and Bachchan, as well as companies such as Mahindra, TCS and Shell India, helped raise awareness that there are just 1,411 tigers left in India. The efforts also helped raise awareness of Brand Aircel and its subscriber base grew from 16 million in December 2008 to 72 million currently, making it the sixth-largest cellular operator in India. The tiger campaign is now in its third season and Vasudev says it is a key part of the company&rsquo;s communication mix.</p>\n<p class="p3">Another company that turned to the environment for its CRM initiative is MakeMyTrip. In 2010, the travel website started the Responsible Traveller initiative to &ldquo;sensitise Indian travellers to the ecological impact of our activities,&rdquo; says Mohit Gupta, chief business and marketing officer, MakeMyTrip. Under this initiative, the company calculates the carbon footprint for each trip on the payments page and offers travellers the opportunity to offset it by making a donation &mdash; starting at Rs 44 for domestic flights and Rs 220 for international flights &mdash; to plant trees. The afforestation activity is conducted by Seva Mandir through the GiveIndia donation platform and MakeMyTrip sends e-mail updates to donors on the status of plantation. &ldquo;From an effectiveness standpoint, the real measure is the number of travellers opting to make this donation to offset their carbon credits. So far, over 90,000 customers have donated over #80 lakh, leading to the planting of over 500,000 trees,&rdquo; adds Gupta.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The real measure of our initiative is the number of travellers opting to make this donation to offset their carbon credits" - Mohit Gupta, chief business and marketing officer, MakeMyTrip</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">CRM is almost always controversy-free and usually proves a win-win for all involved &mdash; companies reach out to customers who are happy to have participated in doing good and the cause itself is benefited. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean there is no criticism of the concept. Often, there is scepticism about the company&rsquo;s motives (especially when the cause isn&rsquo;t related to the brand&rsquo;s main line of business), so the campaign runs the risk of being dismissed as a gimmick.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">More than a decade ago, HUL and Colgate-Palmolive came together to partner with the Kerala government for a hand-washing promotion, &lsquo;Health in your hands&rsquo;, similar to what is currently playing out with Lifebuoy. There was so much resistance &mdash; especially to the idea that Kerala, which has some of the best health indicators in India, needed such a programme &mdash; that the state government ultimately backed out after a couple of years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">For companies to prove their sincerity, there is a need to take a long-term view of cause-related marketing projects. You can&rsquo;t turn your back on it even if the results (in terms of sales) aren&rsquo;t as expected. And that is easier said than done. &ldquo;Like any other communication activity, CRM will also be determined by return on investment. If it doesn&rsquo;t work out, companies will go back to using film stars,&rdquo; says Desai. So, what&rsquo;s the prognosis for CRM activities? They will continue, especially in crowded categories. But, Desai adds, &ldquo;The Re 1 or Rs 2 that a firm contributes for a cause will have to give incremental returns for the brand. If that doesn&rsquo;t happen, they will be quick to look elsewhere.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>', 'Companies are turning to cause-related marketing to make their brands stand out in the clutter — and seeing a direct impact on their business', '7', '', 0, '', 'doing-well-by-doing-good-86', 81, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Doing well by doing good', 'Companies are turning to cause-related marketing to make their brands stand out in the clutter — and seeing a direct impact on their business', '', '', '', 'Hindustan Unilever,Lifebuoy,Cause-related marketing,American Express,Tata Tea,Coca-Cola India,Horlicks,GlaxoSmithKline,Google India,P&G,Marico,Aircel,MakeMyTrip', 0, NULL, '2015-01-15 20:12:49', '2015-01-15 20:30:49', '2014-08-22', 0),
(87, 20, '', 'What comes in, goes out', '<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s a tricky decision whether or not to hold a stock when an excellent image is dashed by corporate governance issues. Investors in Cairn India are facing precisely this dilemma after the company came into the spotlight on July 23 for giving an $800-million loan (commitment for $1.25 billion) to promoter group company Vedanta. Cairn&rsquo;s share price crashed 10.5% to Rs 308 following the news, raising fresh concerns over the Vedanta group&rsquo;s corporate governance standards.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Nitin Tiwari, vice-president, institutional research, Religare, says, &ldquo;<em>Prima facie</em>, it seems that shareholders&rsquo; permission was not taken and notice not given to the markets.&rdquo; S Subramanian, managing director of proxy advisory firm Ingovern, seconds that thought. &ldquo;The company has not even made a formal disclosure of this related-party transaction to exchanges. This shows disregard for fair disclosure by the company and merits a full-fledged investigation by Sebi,&rdquo; he says. It&rsquo;s not the first time the Vedanta group has been embroiled in governance issues. Investors had protested the restructuring of Vedanta in 2008 due to shareholders concerns regarding Vedanta&rsquo;s Zambia-based copper mining and smelting subsidiary, Konkola Copper Mines. Though Vedanta called off the restructuring then, it went ahead in 2012 and merged Sesa Goa, Sterlite, VAL and Malco to form Sesa Sterlite. Minority shareholders of both Sesa and Sterlite had expressed concerns about the Rs 66,717 crore gross debt that Sesa Sterlite had to acquire. Further, the Rs 19,892 crore gross debt of a Rs 2,346-crore, loss-making VAL being transferred to the restructured company sparked investor outrage.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Pumping oil and money - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In Cairn&rsquo;s case, the financial impact is actually positive. The company will give the loan using dollar deposits that earned 2-2.5% interest, while the loan to Vedanta at Libor plus 3% will earn relatively higher returns. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean any great benefit for investors. The Vedanta loan may earn a higher rate and Cairn&rsquo;s capex plans remain adequately funded, but &ldquo;this could be negative for stock sentiment as it could preclude upside to shareholder payouts through dividends,&rdquo; highlights Citi Research in a report.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In FY14, against an earnings per share of Rs 65.2, Cairn had paid dividend of Rs 12.5 per share, with a payout ratio of about 22.5%. However, considering the cash (and equivalent) of Rs 120.31 per share, which is 38.3% of the current market price, investors had expectations of higher dividend.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Even if the company does not distribute the surplus cash as dividends, the Street expects it to deploy it in the business, which made return on equity (RoE) of 24% in FY14. This may now not happen.</p>\n<p class="p3">Cairn India holds some of the best oil assets in India and markets such as Sri Lanka and South Africa. Importantly, hoping that the large part of its capital expenditure is already done, many consumers have invested in the company to gain from future cash flows, which they thought could be used for the distribution of dividend. S Ranganathan, head of research, LKP Securities, says, &ldquo;We have a neutral rating on this stock. It is being bought only for the cash gains. There is practically no earnings growth in the company.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But more than the financial impact, the Street&rsquo;s fear stems from the way cash is being used &mdash; or rather, not used. In its report, ICICI Securities argues, &ldquo;This [loan] raises a question mark on the utilisation of future cash flows and dividend payout, which will impact the return ratios and shareholder value creation.&rdquo; This could be true if the cash is deployed in low yielding funds, which will effectively erode shareholder value. Meanwhile, despite good future prospects, issues about the utilisation of the cash and protection of the interest of minority shareholders could remain. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>', 'Cairn India''s $800-million loan to promoter Vedanta has yet again raised the issue of corporate governance', '20', '', 0, '', 'what-comes-in-goes-out-87', 82, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'What comes in, goes out', 'Cairn India''s $800-million loan to promoter Vedanta has yet again raised the issue of corporate governance', '', '', '', 'Vedanta Group,Cairn India,Corporate governance', 0, NULL, '2015-01-16 12:28:07', '2015-01-16 12:28:51', '2014-08-22', 0);

(88, 20, '', 'The MCX Factor', '<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s a perfect David vs Goliath plot. The only difference is that here, David did not even have to fight the giant &mdash; Goliath simply surrendered in the battle for supremacy in the estimated Rs 100 lakh crore Indian commodity market. David, or Kotak Mahindra Bank, is now the single-largest shareholder in India&rsquo;s largest commodity bourse, holding 80% share of the commodity market, while Goliath, MCX, has been summarily vanquished.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">To understand the present context, one needs to go back to 2010, when Uday Kotak first unveiled a commodity exchange called ACE. This was the first regional futures exchange to go national with a multi-commodities futures trading platform after the Kotak Group got approval from the commodity markets regulator, the Forward Markets Commission (FMC), for a complete transformation in the exchange platform after picking up 51% stake. Though the foray into the commodities exchange was a first by any private sector bank in the country&rsquo;s history, the marketplace at the time was very different. The Jignesh Shah-owned Financial Technologies India (FTIL) was the leader, with its Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) staking claim to a staggering 80% market share.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Within three years of its inception, MCX toppled the agri-commodities exchange, National Commodity Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX), to emerge <em>numero uno</em>. <em>(see: Fast and furious)</em> Its name notwithstanding, ACE never really managed to pose a threat to other exchanges, remaining a peripheral player with around 1% market share. But, in a quirk of fate, ACE finally got to trump MCX by becoming its owner. This curious turn of events happened largely on account of the undoing of Shah, whose overarching greed led to his collapse and the handing over of India&rsquo;s premier commodity exchange on a platter to Kotak, which was more than happy to lap up the opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Changing hands- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The story of MCX is inseparable from that of Shah, who, after a meteoric rise, is now riding the tail of a vanishing flare. MCX was founded by Shah in November 2003 and initially offered facilities for online trading of commodities and clearing and settlement of commodities futures transactions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The technology support and infrastructure was supplied by Shah&rsquo;s FTIL, which went in its favour when it issued an IPO in March 2012 to become the first listed exchange in the country. It was thought that since a promoter was supplying the technology, a competitive arrangement would lead to lower operational costs. Bids poured in to the tune of Rs 35,000 crore for an issue size of &nbsp;Rs 663 crore and the stock saw a listing gain of 26% over its issue price of Rs&nbsp;1,032. MCX progressively grabbed increasingly larger share of the commex pie to reach its current sovereignty over the market. How did this come to be?</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>A charmed decade</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">One of the world&rsquo;s first commodity futures market emerged in India as early as 1875, when trading of cotton futures started in Mumbai, a by-product of the Indian economy&rsquo;s then overwhelming dependence on agriculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In 1952, the Forwards Commodities (Regulation) Act (FCRA) was passed and FMC was instituted in Mumbai the next year as the commodities markets regulator. However, the post-independence period saw the growth of this market being stifled by a socialist government paranoid about speculation and price rise, compounded by a lack of understanding and deep suspicion of the effects of a large-scale futures market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Fast and furious- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Post-liberalisation, the picture changed once again, with futures trading picking up speed and several multi-commodity exchanges and regional exchanges springing up around the country. Today, a few players &mdash; including MCX, NCDEX and the National Multi Commodities &amp; Derivatives Exchange (NMCE), in that order &mdash; dominate the commex market. MCX started around the same time as the other two. How, then, did it achieve its near-monopoly status?</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;MCX profited immensely from a first-mover advantage in the non-agricultural product space and from the fact that it was aggressive in forging tie-ups. The main difference between MCX and other players is that it was primarily involved in trading non-agri products versus other exchanges such as NCDEX,&rdquo; says Naveen Mathur, associate director (commodities and currencies) at Angel Broking. Immediately after its inception, MCX tied up with Bombay Bullion Association (BBA) for bullion futures, Bombay Metal Exchange (BME) for futures in non-ferrous metals, and Solvent Extractors&rsquo; Association for edible oils futures, all of which helped it immensely in cornering a large chunk of the non-agricultural futures market. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>In a league of its own- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">After three years as the No.2 player, MCX finally edged past NCDEX in 2006, aided by a surge in gold futures volumes. This was when it also emerged as the third-largest commex for gold futures trading in the world, behind the New York Mercantile Exchange and Tokyo Commodity Exchange. Many traders switched to the Indian exchange because it had been tremendously successful in providing liquidity to contracts and reducing impact costs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">From then on, market share increased progressively as futures trading in non-agri products such as metal and bullion began to dominate the market. To counter this, NCDEX introduced gold futures trading in 2013. However, not much has changed. &ldquo;For traders, NCDEX remains the agri exchange and MCX is the international commodities exchange,&rdquo; says Kunal Shah, head of commodities at Nirmal Bang. Today, around 80% of the total commex turnover comes from non-agri products, explaining MCX&rsquo;s dominant market share. In FY14, it enjoyed a 99.46% market share in bullion trade and 98.66% market share in the metal trade.&nbsp;(<em>see: In a league of its own</em>)</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Gloomy days</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Starting 2013, MCX faced a slew of negative news that took the stock on a roller-coaster ride. In early 2013, the government announced a commodity transaction tax (CTT) &mdash; amounting to 0.01% of the transaction value &mdash; to be levied on the sellers of non-farm futures starting July. This tax was imposed on items ranging from gold and metals to sugar and edible oils. Only 23 pure agricultural commodities, such as cotton, wheat and potatoes, were exempt from the tax. This led to a severe drop in commexes&rsquo; topline over the financial year and they reported a 62% fall in turnover in 2014. Metal and bullion bore the brunt of this fall, with a steep 70% drop in turnover. Agricultural commodities fared slightly better, with a 14% drop. From Rs&nbsp;125 lakh crore the previous year, MCX&rsquo;s exchange turnover dropped by 39% to Rs&nbsp;76 lakh crore in the first 10 months beginning April 2013. Prior to the CTT, MCX&rsquo;s average daily turnover had increased by 53%, from Rs 21,000 crore in FY10 to Rs 32,100 crore in FY11 and by 57% to Rs 50,300 crore in FY12. A market correction took place to adjust for the truncated turnover. MCX stock prices fell by almost 50% in the period from December 2013 to April 2014, from a high of around Rs 1,600 to Rs 830. However, the knockout punch was still to come.</p>\n<p class="p3">On July 31, 2013, a sordid affair came to light. MCX&rsquo;s spot exchange, the National Spot Exchange (NSEL) defaulted on payments of Rs 5,574 crore, in what is now infamous as the NSEL scam. It was discovered that NSEL was issuing forward contracts only on paper; the underlying commodities did not exist in the company&rsquo;s warehouses and, in some cases, the warehouses themselves were non-existent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Shah and FTIL, which owned a 99.99% stake in NSEL, were heavily implicated and FTIL stock prices crashed along with investor confidence. The domino effect of FTIL&rsquo;s bad Street credibility spilt over to MCX &mdash; the market price fell by 7% in a day&rsquo;s trade. In a fortnight &mdash; which can be a lifetime in the stock market, in some cases &mdash; the price hit rock-bottom, down 65% from Rs 690 to Rs 243.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Course correction- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The combined effect of the CTT and the NSEL debacle led to a drop in volumes and resulted in MCX losing a portion of its market share to NCDEX, which has reported a 12% rise in turnover and whose market share has jumped from 11% to 18% in the first quarter of FY15. &ldquo;Around 35-40% of the drop in volumes has been a result of the CTT. Beyond that, it is the contribution of the negative sentiment in connection with the NSEL issue,&rdquo; says Angel Broking&rsquo;s Mathur.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The turn of events led to a steady exit of institutional investors from MCX. Compared with 58% on June 30, 2013, the stake of institutional investors had dropped to 36% a year later. In December 2013, FMC declared anchor investor FTIL &ldquo;not fit and proper&rdquo; to run MCX and ordered it to sell its 26% stake and exit the exchange business. Its shareholding pattern displayed the share of retail investors doubling from 7% in June 2013 to 14% in June 2014, many of whom were probably banking on an open offer from a potential buyer for FTIL&rsquo;s doomed holding.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">To compound matters, in May 2014, a forensic audit report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) that unearthed serious corporate governance issues was made public. The report said that MCX&rsquo;s management was executing decisions taken by FTIL&rsquo;s senior management. It highlighted questionable &lsquo;one-sided&rsquo; transactions, stating that while 25% of FTIL&rsquo;s revenue came from supplying technology to MCX, MCX didn&rsquo;t have the requisite bargaining power. In July 2014, MCX announced that it was looking to scale down its technology contract with FTIL to five years, extendable to 20 years, from the current contract of 33 years, extendable to 99 years. A clean divorce was in the works.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>Enter Kotak</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The bidding process commenced in April 2014. Companies such as Reliance Capital, the BSE and Kotak Mahindra Bank swooped down on the FTIL holding with non-binding bids following the FMC announcement. On May 6, Sebi issued brand new guidelines mandating that only domestic commexes, stock exchanges, depositories, banks, insurance companies or a public financial institution could hold 15% stake in commodity exchanges. Individuals and other kinds of companies could only hold up to a total 5% stake. After this development, Kotak Mahindra Bank emerged as the frontrunner in the bidding race, with a bid of Rs 459 crore for a 15% stake in MCX, at an average price of Rs 600 per share.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;MCX was a unique opportunity for us. We believe it is a strong franchise. From our perspective, we like the financial infrastructure space. It&rsquo;s a strong play on the India story; if the India story does well then the commodities space will do well and the equity markets will do well,&rdquo; says Paul Parambi, group strategy head at Kotak Mahindra Bank. Parambi is banking on the FCRA regulation being passed soon for MCX to transform into a cash machine. &ldquo;As regulations get freed, options trading is permitted and restrictions on the trade of certain commodities are removed, non-linear growth to MCX will happen,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"A change in the regulatory climate will also end up driving non-linear growth for MCX" - Paul Parambi, Group strategy head, Kotak Mahindra</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Parambi adds that this is a purely financial investment and that Kotak is in it for the long haul, not for short-term capital gains. &ldquo;However, we will constantly evaluate once the deal is closed,&rdquo; he says. The ACE experience was a good opportunity for Kotak to learn the ropes of the commex market. &ldquo;What we&rsquo;ve learnt from various exchanges is that if there is a player who&rsquo;s got a good market share in a particular space, for example, MCX in bullion and metals, and NCDEX in agri-commodities, it&rsquo;s difficult to take market share from them, which is why when we got a chance to acquire a 15% stake in MCX, we went for it,&rdquo; he explains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">However, there are some possible downsides. Parambi lists them all in a flurry of ifs. &ldquo;If some events that we are expecting do not come about, if volumes do not grow as one might hope for over time, if potential liabilities because of events in the past turn out to be larger than we expect, and though we do not expect this, if competition is able to take share away from MCX,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>A mixed bag</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">A week before the Kotak announcement, maverick investor &lsquo;Big Bull&rsquo; Rakesh Jhunjhunwala acquired a 2% stake in MCX at Rs 664 a share. Jhunjhunwala&rsquo;s strong market credibility did wonders for investor confidence and significantly boosted valuations, helping the stock price reach a 52-week closing high of Rs 679.7.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But really, it is the Kotak development that has done much to assuage investor confidence. &ldquo;With this deal, confidence of investors is likely to be boosted, as the overhang around its issues with its earlier parent, FTIL, is now behind it. This will also likely aid sentiment of potential customers of MCX, who had arguably curtailed transactions post-FTIL related issues since average daily value (ADV) traded went down by about 30%,&rdquo; says Gautam Chhaochharia, head of research at UBS Securities India. However, it isn&rsquo;t enough to drive up prices significantly. &ldquo;The key push will be regulation instead of ownership,&rdquo; says Ashish Chopra, analyst with brokerage firm Motilal Oswal. The regulatory push Chopra is talking about is an amendment of the FCRA, which was tabled in the Lok Sabha in March 2013 after being stuck in a Parliamentary quagmire for the past seven or eight years. The amendment will provide autonomy to FMC, introduce new products such as options and indices trading in the commodities futures market and allow banks, mutual funds and insurance companies to participate in the futures market. It will also drive up volumes four or five times the current levels and provide a much-needed fillip to a beleaguered commodities market.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"With the Kotak deal, investor confidence in the new entity is likely to get a boost" - Gautam Chhaochharia, head of research, UBS Securities</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">However, not everyone is as optimistic about the FCRA. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in this industry for the past 10 years. They keep saying FCRA will be passed, if not in the Budget session, then the monsoon session or the winter session. Sometimes it&rsquo;s presented through an ordinance but somehow it lapses every time. I&rsquo;ve only been disappointed so far but I&rsquo;m still hopeful,&rdquo; says Mathur. Nirmal Bang&rsquo;s Shah expects some positive developments in the next six to eight months, but feels FCRA is only one part of the picture. &ldquo;More than FCRA, the government should focus on making market-making legal. Today, corporates like Hindalco hedge risk in the international commodities market because the domestic market lacks depth. If even 10% of the money that is going out is diverted to the domestic commodities market, volumes will shoot up three or four times,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Today, the MCX stock is also riding on hope. Its market share has declined by around 6% from 86% to 80% since the last year and it has reported a 42% decline in volumes and 43% drop in net profit. Profits in the March &rsquo;14 quarter have declined by 36% from Rs 76.63 crore to Rs 43.75 crore, while revenue has slipped almost 50% from Rs 126.66 crore to Rs 63.96 crore. However, the company has zero debt and possesses ample cash reserves of Rs 388 crore as on September 2013. MCX has more than 2,100 registered members, compared with 800-1,000 members in NCDEX. &ldquo;The market impact cost or trading cost in the non-agri space for MCX is lower than NCDEX because of high liquidity, while transaction charges are higher. Conversely, for agri-products, NCDEX has lower impact cost and higher transaction charges. Both exchanges keep transaction charges low for the products they want to promote,&rdquo; says Mathur. For example, MCX charges Rs 2.1 for Rs 1 lakh of turnover for metals and energy contracts, compared with Rs 0.75 for agri-commodity contracts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The combined effect of the CTT and the NSEL debacle has been to NCDEX&rsquo;s advantage. NCDEX has also benefited by the introduction of evening trade and smaller-sized future contracts in <em>chana</em> and castor seed. To counter the prolonged fall in volumes, MCX decided to cut transaction charges in the trade of all commodities in March 2014. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Analysts feel MCX&rsquo;s performance has bottomed out and expect its EPS to increase from Rs 24 to Rs 27 in FY15 and go up to Rs 32 in FY16. And investors remain largely optimistic, barring a few uncertainties. &ldquo;The business enjoys the largest market share in its segment. The exchange market is only 10 years old and is at an evolutionary stage in India. Today&rsquo;s volume rates may not justify it but there is good scope in the future,&rdquo; says Chopra.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Another major factor that is maintaining investors&rsquo; hopes is that once the FCRA amendment is passed, MCX will see its topline shoot with negligible capital expenditure, as it is already technology-ready. MCX, courtesy FTIL, has a vast network of more than 400,000 trading terminals spread across 1,900 cities in the country. The technology infrastructure has a capacity to handle up to 10 million transactions daily. The trading high so far has been 1.9 million trades. If the FCRA is passed and volumes shoot up, market sources say MCX will bring in a flood of money to its investors with almost zero capex, providing excellent return on equity (RoE) levels in the future. In FY14, however, the company&rsquo;s RoE has fallen to 13.3%, compared with 28% in FY13 and 32% in FY12. (<em>see: In a pincer</em>)</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>In a pincer- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The ownership issue has been settled with Kotak playing the knight in shining armour. Corporate governance issues have also been largely resolved so far, with MCX reportedly in the process of appointing a new CEO. &ldquo;It will be a good bet for the extreme long term, in case you are planning to just buy the stock and forget about it and wait for the monopolistic position MCX enjoys and impending regulatory changes to yield benefits,&rdquo; says Chopra. Chhaochharia is also bullish on the stock. &ldquo;We believe stock would trade at premium valuations in the near-medium term, given FTIL overhang is now resolved and there are hopes around Kotak driving growth in business,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp; At current levels of Rs 836, the stock is trading at 26 times its FY15 and 22 times its FY16 estimated earnings, a figure that is in line with its Asian peers, which are trading at 20-28x FY16 PE range.</p>\n<p class="p3">But it&rsquo;s not a completely rosy picture. There are a few issues that still require resolution and some unknown liabilities might play spoiler. &ldquo;The market is awaiting the resolution of the technology issue since FTIL is still a vendor. It is concerned over certain interoperability issues that PwC highlighted in transactions between the parent and MCX,&rdquo; says Chopra. However, since the current arrangement is tilted towards FTIL, any freshly negotiated agreement with a new software vendor will work out in favour of MCX.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Also, the fact that MCX might have to face tax liabilities in the range of Rs 800-1,000 crore as a result of unaccounted related-party transactions between MCX and FTIL is making some jittery. However, it is thought that these liabilities are accounted for in valuations. At least on the NSEL count, investors need not worry. &ldquo;Though there are around 1,000 brokers common to NSEL and MCX, there is no direct cross liability nor are any top MCX brokers distressed. Otherwise, the impact would be visible by now not only in MCX but also in other exchanges,&rdquo; says G V Giri of IIFL. In spite of these issues, there is a general feeling in the market that the worst is behind MCX. &ldquo;As they say, it is darkest before dawn. This is the state of the commodities market today. We had CTT and then the NSEL scam but now things are finally looking up,&rdquo; sums up Nirmal Bang&rsquo;s Shah. &nbsp;</p>', 'MCX is basking under the light of a new set of promoters.

(89, 20, '', 'Pennar''s new avatar', '<p class="p1">The eagle is the most majestic bird in the sky. Legend has it that all eagles molt &mdash; at least once &mdash; during their lifetime. When an eagle reaches the age of 30, its physical condition deteriorates. Its talons lose their flexibility and cannot properly grip the prey. Its beak becomes dull and bent. Its wing feathers become thick and heavy, sticking to its chest and impairing its flight. This makes survival difficult and causes a great deal of depression. The bird then retreats to a mountain-top, where over a five-month period it knocks off its beak by banging it against a rock. It plucks out its talons and feathers. Each stage produces re-growth of the removed body parts that &lsquo;renews&rsquo; the eagle and allows it to live for another 30-40 years.</p>\n<p class="p3">The story of Pennar Industries of Hyderabad shows quite a few similarities to the life cycle of the eagle. Pennar set up a cold-rolling steel strip (CRSS) and cold-rolled formed sections (CRFS) plant in 1988. Building on its initial success, it acquired Nagarjuna&rsquo;s steel plant and financed it through debt, suffering during the industrial slowdown of 1998-2002. The sales of the company took a hit from Rs 260 crore in FY99 to Rs 72 crore in FY02, while profitability declined from Rs 8.5 crore to a loss of Rs 46 crore over the same period. Not surprisingly, the downturn saw the stock collapse from its high of Rs 80 in 1992 to around 40 paise in 2002. It used the brief upturn in 2004-2007 to focus on its core capabilities in steel manufacturing and exited its profile and aluminium units. Just like the eagle, Pennar shed additional weight and began the journey of transformation. The company had the vision to transform itself from a commodity player and move up the value chain by providing value-added engineering services and products. &ldquo;We wanted to transition from being a manufacturer of commodity steel to a provider of engineered products and services as we believed that our business model could no longer serve to deliver our growth, profitability and liquidity targets,&rdquo; explains Aditya Rao, the chairman, Nrupender Rao&rsquo;s, son who was recently appointed vice-chairman and managing director. The is now divided into four strategic business units: systems and projects, industrial components, precision tubes and steel products, and each has its own distinct markets, capital assets and distinct customers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Turning point</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Ten years ago, Pennar was forced to change. It embraced continuous value-addition as a competitive advantage in a world with breakneck technological advancements. It reduced its dependence on steel products, with value-added applications increasing from 36% of sales in 2007 to 50% in 2014. <em>(see: Changing contours) </em>The core steel business has allowed it to enter new sectors such as precision tubes, railway coach profiles, road safety systems and pre-engineered buildings. The entry into value-add business was the brain child of Aditya, a physics and engineering management graduate from Cornell University. Aditya founded new businesses: Pennar Engineered Building Systems (PEBS) in 2010 and Pennar Enviro in 2013. PEBS has many firsts to its credit by building the first gold-rated green factory in India, by constructing the largest clear span building&nbsp; (99 m), and by setting up the largest warehouse in the country (10 million sq ft). In just four years since commencing operations, PEBS clocked revenues of Rs 352 crore (FY14). In 2013, PEBS also raised Rs 50 crore (25% stake) through a private equity firm, Zephyr Peacock.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Changing contours- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">While captive consumption of cold-rolled steel sheets today accounts for about 33% of production, going forward, these businesses will give way to engineering-oriented business units, focusing primarily on system integration and custom-designed products, thereby enhancing earnings of the company. &ldquo;We believe that an entry into precision profiles used in the aerospace and defence sectors would allow these products to improve in margin profile as well as drive further revenue growth in these business units. A continuous process of product development with our key customers will allow CRSS and CRFS to grow margins and scale,&rdquo; says Aditya. The company&rsquo;s CRFS and CRSS businesses, currently, enjoy operating margins of around 7% and 10%, respectively.</p>\n<p class="p3">Pennar also set up manufactured and fabrication facilities for industrial buildings, electrodes for electrostatic precipitators (extensively used for pollution control in the cement and thermal power industries) and seed processing plants. Special efforts were made to manufacture components for the automotive and white goods sectors. It also acquired the press metal profiles division of Tube Investments Group (TI) and created manufacturing facilities to develop precision tubes (CDW) components for automotive and general engineering applications, mounting structures for solar panels and hydraulics cylinders.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Sunrise sectors</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The company has made two strategic investments in sunrise industries. Pennar&rsquo;s engineering credentials allow it to enter new markets faster than competition. Steel buildings are the fastest systems for industrial construction today and are popular all over the world in the form of pre-engineered buildings (PEB). These are custom-designed, expandable, durable and maintenance-free. These buildings are suitable for industrial as well as commercial applications such as warehouses, factories, aircraft hangars, logistic parks, etc. It is a Rs 5,000-crore industry and is growing at more than 20% a year. Pennar&rsquo;s PEBS engineering team size per crore of revenue is the highest in the industry. This has been instrumental in allowing the company (<em>see: The pull factor</em>) to grow at three times the market growth rate over the past three years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>The pull factor- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Pennar Enviro (PEL), another manufacturing unit, makes and markets fuel additives and water treatment chemicals. It has diversified by providing cohesive solutions in the design and construction of clear water and wastewater treatment plants. The water-treatment business of Pennar has grown at over 200% the last fiscal, when the overall water-treatment industry has had negative growth. But given the market size of Rs 20,000 crore, there is enough headroom for growth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">As industrial activities increase in India, the services, engineering, design and products of Pennar will be in huge demand. Amtech Auto, Larsen &amp; Toubro, My Home Construction, Ranbaxy and AGI Glaspac are some of its clients. Since the company has entered this business last year, it is still small compared with players such as Thermax and Va Tech Wabag in terms of topline and products services offered. Pennar is positioning the enviro division as a proxy play on the PEB business, since it targets clients of the PEBS division, offering related solutions. For example, a prefab factory setup would require a wastewater management system for its other industrial activities.</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>The road ahead</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">In FY14, the company had clocked sales of Rs 1,117 crore and hopes to triple turnover in the coming years. &ldquo;On a consolidated basis we hope to triple turnover over the next three to four years. This will be accomplished by expanding market share in our project businesses and investing around #50 crore per year into all of our business units to fund capacity and capability expansion,&rdquo; says Aditya. The upturn in industrial activity is likely to expand return on capital employed (ROCE) and shareholder value significantly. The consolidated entity, Pennar Industries, has low levels of debt. The debt to equity ratio of the company is 0.4x, which is primarily working capital short-term debt. &ldquo;Strategic use of debt to gain market share is a very possible option that will allow the company to outgrow our competitors. Increasing capacity, entry into new geographies, expansion of product and service profile are potential avenues to deploy capital,&rdquo; mentions Aditya.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The slowdown in the infrastructure, automotive and railways sectors, however, has had a severe impact on operations at Pennar, resulting in higher operating costs, increase in working capital costs, longer operating cycles and delays in order-book execution. The company&rsquo;s profits have fallen from Rs 76 crore in FY11 to Rs 31 crore in FY14, while sales declined 3.6% to Rs 1,074 crore led by a squeeze in margins. <em>(see: Feeling the pinch)</em></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Feeling the pinch- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">As the economy recovers with the promise of new deals from the new government, Pennar is strongly positioned to reap the benefit. Most of its business units are working at a 60-70% utilisation level, indicating high level of operating leverage available in the business as sales increase manifold over the next few years. Procurement efficiencies, economies of scale, lower logistics costs from the vicinity of manufacturing locations to customers and pan-India marketing presence will help it be price-competitive and launch new products. &ldquo;Pennar&rsquo;s engineering credentials will allow us to rapidly enter and evaluate new markets faster than our competitors. For example, PEBS&rsquo; engineering team size per crore of revenue is the highest in the industry. This has allowed the company to grow at three times the market growth rate of close to 30% a year, over the past three years,&rdquo; points out Aditya.</p>\n<p class="p3">Pennar has a strong product portfolio and its product profile touches the vision laid down by the new government in the areas of infrastructure development, industrial infrastructure by PEBs, railways and solar profiles. As the eagle spreads its wings after molt and resumes flight, Pennar is ready to take off. In a down cycle, the company has achieved ROCE of 15-20% levels and we expect a minimum 20% ROCE during the upturn. Though the commodity business is vulnerable, the company is moving towards value-added segments, which after attaining a certain scale will reduce the effect of commodity blues on the company. Though in the current rally, the stock has doubled to Rs 40 levels, we believe there is enough headroom for the stock to grow. At current prices, the stock is trading at a PE of five times FY15/FY16 earnings. Investors looking for a long haul can hop on to the gravy train.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7"><strong>The author is the managing partner and CEO, Vallum advisors.

(90, 20, '', 'City City Bang Bang', '<p class="p1">Some of us will take a lifetime to master eating with chopsticks and some of us will die trying. But for Shigeo Hoshino, eating <em>biryani</em> with his hands was one of the most difficult things he has ever done. &ldquo;It was very hard but ultimately very tasty, so it was worth the effort,&rdquo; says the president of Japanese auto ancillary firm Piolax India, which supplies components to Nissan and Maruti Suzuki in India.</p>\n<p class="p3">India has been home to Hoshino since December 2011, when his company set up shop here to supply to Nissan. Not satisfied with the terms at the Renault Nissan supplier&rsquo;s park in Oragadam, Piolax decided to invest in Sri City, an integrated business city situated 55 km from Chennai. &ldquo;People felt that the distance between Sri City and Oragadam may be a little too far but we were impressed with the infrastructure and connectivity here.&rdquo; The company invested #50 crore to set up a facility with 20 injection moulding machines. &ldquo;India is a growing market that everybody is watching closely. If you have to get ahead in this market, you need to move quickly,&rdquo; says Hoshino. The &yen;54-billion Piolax was one of the first companies to set up operations in Sri City and is now talking to Tata and Mahindra about expanding its presence in the domestic market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"India is a growing market that everybody is watching closely. You need to move quickly here" - Shigeo Hoshino, president, Piolax India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Sri City, the brainchild of Ravindra Sannareddy, helps firms across the world set up a presence in India. On the Andhra Pradesh-Tamil Nadu border and with a land bank of around 7,000 acre, Sri City features 100 firms from 25 countries, including the US, the UK, France, Spain, Italy and Japan, and some of the leading MNCs, which invested nearly Rs 1,400 crore to set up operations here. The facility houses a special economic zone (SEZ), domestic tariff zone and free trade and warehousing zones. It was planned by Jurong Consultants, Singapore, on the work-live-learn-play concept and offers residential, educational and healthcare facilities. Of the 100 companies, 60 have operational facilities and the remaining are under construction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>HOW IT ALL BEGAN</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">After a long stint in IT in the US, Sannareddy decided to return in 2001. While spearheading his company, Megasoft, he was toying with the idea of developing an SEZ for manufacturing, after seeing Shenzhen in Hong Kong and Cyberjaya and Petrajaya in Malayasia. &ldquo;Our customers would come to India for IT but go to China for manufacturing. We needed to develop world-class infrastructure for manufacturing in India,&rdquo; says Sannareddy. The push came when the SEZ Act was passed in 2006. Sannareddy, along with friend Srini Raju, part of the founding team of Satyam, Cognizant and Peepul Capital, set up Sri City in 2006. The location wasn&rsquo;t hard to pick as the region had easy access to rail, roads (on the NH 5) and ports (four of them around a 100-km radius &mdash; Chennai, Ennore, Kattupalli and Krishnapattinam). Access to engineering graduates and semi-skilled labour close by helped. &ldquo;You need an ecosystem to develop infrastructure, along with the availability of land at affordable costs,&rdquo; says Sannareddy. &ldquo;You can go to the desert and buy thousands of acres at throwaway prices, but unless you have an ecosystem, any kind of development will be difficult.&rdquo; The company has invested Rs 1,000 crore to acquire land and develop the infrastructure, funded by loans and equity (Rs 300 crore). It has managed to attract PE investments from Ochziff PE Fund, Credit Asia Capital, Bedrock LLC, US, and Chintala Party Holdings. Once 5,000 acre was acquired, the project was formally launched in 2008, with Piolax and Kobelco among the first to invest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Takeshi Akiyama, director, operations, Kobelco Construction Equipment India, part of the $2.8-billion Kobe Steel Group, doesn&rsquo;t share Hoshino&rsquo;s love for spicy food but is equally enthusiastic about India. Akiyama first came to India in 2009, when Kobelco decided to set up operations here. It had a sales and service office in Noida but once the yen got stronger thanks to the Lehman crisis, the imports of these machines became uncompetitive, prompting it to set up operations here. After deciding that Mahindra World City was too posh for it, Kobelco zeroed in on Sri City. But what took Akiyama most by surprise was the speed at which things moved. &ldquo;Ten months from when we made our decision, the plant was up and running. Ten months is the usual lead time in Japan but I was surprised that the same was possible here,&rdquo; says Akiyama. The plant assembles paints, ships 20- and 38-tonne hydraulic excavators and has the annual capacity to produce 1,200 machines every year. It invested &yen;20 million (Rs 11.8 crore) in the project, with the total investment reaching Rs 100 crore over a four-year period. The company has plants at six locations in Japan, China, Thailand and the US, and Akiyama is proud that machines coming out of the company&rsquo;s Indian factory match the standards of its overseas plants. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think we would be able to match our quality standards in Japan but we have Indian workers who are very eager to learn more about the Japanese manufacturing method,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;All I have to do is train them right and they are able to match up in terms of quality.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Our plant is expected to be fully operational by 2016 with a capacity to manufacture around 50,000 units" - Shigeru Wakabayashi, deputy MD, Isuzu Motors India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Making larger bets on the domestic market is fellow Japanese company, Isuzu Motors, which is investing around Rs 3,000 crore to manufacture SUVs and pick-up trucks in India. &ldquo;We chose Sri City since it provided us easy access to automotive hub Chennai,&rdquo; says Shigeru Wakabayashi, deputy managing director, Isuzu Motors India. &ldquo;Our plant in Sri City is expected to be fully operational by 2016 and will have capacity for 50,000 units in the initial stage. After a few years, the capacity will be increased to 100,000-120,000 units.&rdquo; When the plant becomes fully operational, it will provide employment to 2,000 persons.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>THE MNC BRIGADE</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Europe has fair representation too, with French major Alstom and Italy&rsquo;s Danieli making sizeable investments. For Alstom, investing in Sri City was part of its strategy of being closer to its clients. The company has bagged an order to supply 42 trains to Chennai Metro as part of a &euro;243-million (Rs 2,053-crore) order. The first nine, of which two have been delivered, will be built in its plant in Brazil and the rest at Sri City. Alstom will invest Rs 250 crore in the facility, which is expected to be commissioned in 2014. Danieli, which manufactures stainless steel products for automotive, steel and bearing industries, has also invested Rs 750 crore to set up a manufacturing facility.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But some of the largest investments have come from the FMCG sector. Mondelez India Foods is setting up its largest chocolate manufacturing facility in Sri City. &ldquo;After evaluating several options and based on our own internal business needs, we decided to invest here as it is a unique world-class integrated business city with access to multiple logistics hubs,&rdquo; says Arjun Bhowmik, director, expansion, Mondelez India Foods. &ldquo;We believe the location will help us strengthen our operations in south India, reduce delivered cost and improve product freshness.&rdquo; The company will invest Rs 1,000 crore as part of phase 1 of the project, spread over 134 acre. The project will be completed in four phases from 2015 to 2020 and will eventually have an annual capacity of 250,000 tonne. &ldquo;We plan to begin operations by mid-2015 and the facility is expected to create close to 1,600 direct jobs by the year 2020,&rdquo; says Bhowmik.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Biggies come home- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">PepsiCo is setting up its largest manufacturing plant in the township. As part of its plan to invest Rs 33,000 crore in India by 2020, the company will spend Rs 1,200 crore in setting up this greenfield facility, which will manufacture its fruit-based, carbonated and sports drinks. The plant is set to provide employment to over 8,000 people. FMCG heavyweight Kellogg&rsquo;s is also investing Rs 200 crore to set up a manufacturing facility here, while Colgate Palmolive is setting up a toothbrush manufacturing unit investing #150 crore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While companies from Japan, Europe and the US setting up shop in India may be common, what&rsquo;s unusual about Sri City is that it has even got some companies that have moved from China. Take the case of Pals Plush, a Chinese toy-maker that is investing in India instead of scaling up operations in China. &ldquo;Expanding in China was a challenge because there was limited availability of labour and wages were inching higher,&rdquo; says Seema Nehra, director, Pals Plush.</p>\n<p class="p3">The toy company zeroed in on India after ruling out Vietnam and Bangladesh. After a futile three-day hunt for locations in Chennai, the Pals Plush team was ready to give up when they were informed about Sri City. &ldquo;We arrived here to check the location and went back only once we inked the deal. Thanks to their single-window clearance, we didn&rsquo;t have to run around for approvals,&rdquo; says Nehra.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We arrived here to check the location and went back only once we inked the deal" - Seema Nehra, director, Pals Plush India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Pals Plush, which has an overall revenue of $10 million and counts Disney, Hasbro, Kohl&rsquo;s and Argo as customers, has set up its facility here at an investment of $2 million. The facility houses 250 machines and employs 400 workers, compared with 180 employees and 120 machines in China. The company is planning to invest another $2 million to increase the number of machines to 600 and workers to 800 by the end of 2014. Nehra says that by shifting operations to India, the company can offer a 7-15% discount to customers thanks to lower wage costs.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>PUSHING AHEAD</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Over the years, the journey hasn&rsquo;t been hunky dory for Sri City. Post the Lehman crisis towards the end of 2008, several companies pressed the pause button on their plans here. Things started to slow down, but Sannareddy stuck to his decision to invest in the infrastructure. &ldquo;We saw the slowdown as an opportunity to develop infrastructure at the lowest cost. We knew that unless we developed world-class infra, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to attract world-class companies,&rdquo; he says. He adds that once the companies saw that the infra was in place, they started to sign up. Since the export markets were looking lacklustre, the company set up a special domestic trade zone for multinational companies to help them improve their footprint in the domestic market. At full occupancy, Sannareddy expects Sri City to house 300-400 companies and provide employment to 300,000 people. Currently, Sri City and the companies in it provide direct and indirect employment to about 30,000 people. In the next three or four years, Sannareddy expects another 100 companies to sign up as infrastructure further improves.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"We knew that unless we developed world-class infra, we wouldn''t be able to attract world-class companies" - Ravindra Sannareddy, co-founder, and MD, Sri City</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">While there are chinks such as power cuts and traffic en route the ports, companies that have invested in Sri City seem to be a happy lot. Some are looking to expand operations by the year-end. &ldquo;Hopefully, the next time you come here, we would have expanded our facilities,&rdquo; says Piolax&rsquo;s Hoshino, pointing to a vacant plot adjacent to the current facility. &ldquo;I am very bullish about the Indian market,&rdquo; he says, one of the few people actually enjoying Chennai&rsquo;s summer &mdash; not for its heat but for its delicious mango season. Sometimes, we all need an outsider to find the silver lining, and with customers like these, Sannareddy may not have too much to worry about. <span class="s2">&nbsp;</span></p>', 'Sri City, with an integrated SEZ and domestic trade zone, is fast emerging as an investment destination for MNCs thanks to its port connectivity and single-window clearance', '6', '', 0, '', 'city-city-bang-bang-90', 85, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'City City Bang Bang', 'Sri City, with an integrated SEZ and domestic trade zone, is fast emerging as an investment destination for MNCs thanks to its port connectivity and single-window clearance', '', '', '', 'Sri City,Ravindra Sannareddy,Integrated SEZ,Piolax India,Kobelco Construction Equipment India,Isuzu Motors,Alstom,Danieli,Mondelez Foods,PepsiCo,Kellogg''s,Colgate Palmolive,Pals Plush', 0, NULL, '2015-01-16 13:28:50', '2015-01-16 13:48:13', '2014-08-22', 0),

(92, 24, '', 'Random acts of kindness', '<p class="p1">It is quite easy to spot Ameeta Chatterjee at her Worli office: her sunny demeanour brightens up the otherwise gloomy weather characteristic of Mumbai monsoons. Chatterjee wraps her <em>saree</em> around herself as she sits down to explain why she decided to start working with child health NGO Ekam Foundation after quitting her high-profile job as a director with KPMG in London. It was when she took a self-enforced sabbatical in 2011 to be with her kids that parent foundation GiveIndia approached her to run the Mumbai chapter of Ekam. &ldquo;When I gave up my job, I remember telling myself that I wouldn&rsquo;t plan anything. We spend so much of our time and energy planning every little detail of our lives. I told myself that I would take whatever comes my way, as long as it wasn&rsquo;t a typical 9-to-5 job. Ekam has been one of those things,&rdquo; she says.</p>\n<p class="p3">While Chatterjee still works as an independent consultant, she remains devoted to Ekam. Her experience in the health and education sector in the UK introduced her to many public-private partnership models that had an observable impact. The move from the corporate sector, then, helped her figure out how things work on both sides of the fence. &ldquo;A lot of the work I did was about helping the public health infrastructure through private intervention. The issue was to be able to use the efficiency, productivity or capital available in the private sector to improve public healthcare outcomes. At Ekam, the idea is to channelise private money to a public space by maintaining all of that along with value for money and affordability, though we are yet to perfect a sustainable model,&rdquo; she explains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Getting word out is, hence, extremely important. Towards this end, in 2013, Chatterjee published a book of poems called <em>A Journey in Love</em>, proceeds from which were used in support of the foundation. Her husband, Goldman Sachs chairman Sonjoy Chatterjee, has been very supportive of her work with the foundation and offers a helping hand sometimes. For her children, Chatterjee&rsquo;s work with the foundation is an opportunity to see a very different side of their mother, while learning about the value of money. &ldquo;They are interested in knowing what we do. I was browsing for watches in London some time back and my daughter reminded me that I already have a watch. That was a touching moment. They have started making changes to their lifestyle in terms of cost-cutting because they know that the extra money can help underprivileged kids their age.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">In future, Chatterjee wants to focus on the treatment of learning disabilities in India. Now that Ekam has expanded operations to Chhattisgarh with aid from Unicef, she, along with the foundation, is trying her best to incorporate the existing system to benefit the children she works for. It&rsquo;s not smooth sailing at all but Chatterjee is taking it with a smile on her face. &ldquo;Every time I have a bad day, I remind myself that it doesn&rsquo;t matter because my work has benefited 350 kids so far and their lives are better off than before. That is a very satisfying thought,&rdquo; she says, her smile never wavering.</p>', 'Ameeta Chatterjee, former director at KPMG, on why she left her corporate job to work for an NGO', '16', '', 0, '', 'random-acts-of-kindness-92', 87, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Random acts of kindness', 'Ameeta Chatterjee, former director at KPMG, on why she left her corporate job to work for an NGO', '', '', '', 'Ameeta Chatterjee,Ekam Foundation,A Journey in Love', 0, NULL, '2015-01-16 13:59:58', NULL, '2014-08-22', 0),
(93, 24, '', 'Sock it!', '<p class="p1">A group of friends get together in Lutyen&rsquo;s Delhi to enjoy a drink, a smoke. The conversation turns to luxury and how it has become possible to buy high-end fashion in retail &mdash; if by fashion we mean suits, jackets, shirts, shoes and so on. But what about socks? Why is it impossible to find elegant, trendy socks that are also great to wear? Of such conversations are ideas &mdash; and brands &mdash; born. At the time of writing, I have paid for my first samples of Kipp &amp; Ludwig socks but have yet to receive the order, so I write without prejudice.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s be honest, few luxury brands have bothered to pay anything more than lip service to that bit of ankle fashion that stylists insist is one of the most important pieces of men&rsquo;s fashion wear. And yet, they&rsquo;re predictable enough to be boring at most fashion houses &mdash; I checked Calvin Klein (because they do great innerwear) and Hugo Boss. Priced anywhere from Rs 700 to Rs 1,200 a pair, they&rsquo;re mostly dark, or tritely striped, but someone should tell them the well-dressed gentleman has moved on from the last century. You&rsquo;d think Zara would have a more playful range, but I found their Rs 390 pairs banal. Marks &amp; Spencer, from where we hoarded our socks on overseas visits, are not worth the bargain basement prices they offer.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;The surprise pick of the pack, I have to admit, was Paul Smith, which does cotton and wool blended socks mostly in the Rs 1,500-2,000 range, that tickled my fancy because it has chosen to be adventurous with its motifs and irregular stripes and prisms. It makes the Kipp &amp; Ludwig socks I&rsquo;ve ordered appear &lsquo;safe&rsquo; by comparison, but let&rsquo;s hold on to that review yet.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;So, if the big brands can&rsquo;t be bothered with the business of ankle fashion, perhaps the fast-fashion brands will have to suffice. Lacoste had just quarter peds the day I checked, Benetton at Rs 300 was uninspiring, while Superdry extended itself to the whole range of stars and stripes at Rs 1,800-3,000 for a pack of three that I might just order on a rainy day when I have nothing better to do. And what about Nike and Reebok? Let&rsquo;s just say, the athletes can have a field day there.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;Because comparisons in the world of socks are not among high-fashion labels but with a hierarchy that sock brands have established for themselves, the well-dressed gent might do well to remember that the world&rsquo;s best socks boast the following lineage: Gammarelli in Rome, which clothes popes and cardinals and supplies great footies for Rs 1,600; Zimmerli, at an astounding Rs 12,000 a cashmere pair, which underlines the fact that the best need not always look it; Falke, which gets a middle-path rating from the cognoscenti; Zimmerli and Pantherella, which have been at the forefront of the socks war for years but are now lagging behind because of a change in blends; and Bresciani (Rs 3,500), Gallo, Viccel and Dore Dore, which get a thumbs up from those who insist that socks are at least as important as shirts when it comes to looking good. At Rs 399-699 for a pair, I&rsquo;m still waiting for the Kipp &amp; Ludwigs that I ordered before pronouncing the final judgement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>The author is a Delhi-based&nbsp;writer and curator</strong></p>', 'If you haven''t been paying attention to what you wear around your ankles, this one''s for you', '17', '', 0, '', 'sock-it-93', 88, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Sock it!', 'If you haven''t been paying attention to what you wear around your ankles, this one''s for you', '', '', '', 'Kipp&Ludwig,Calvin Klein,Zara,Marks&Spencer,Benetton,Nike,Reebok,Gammarelli,Zimmerli,Pantherella,Bresciani,Gallo,Viccel,Dore Dore', 0, NULL, '2015-01-16 14:42:19', NULL, '2014-08-22', 0),
(94, 24, '', 'Bridging the gap', '<p class="p1">The rich countries must move forward economically by, in effect, building the road on which they must travel. Poorer countries, those outside the trilateral regions, can move faster because, trailing behind, they can use the road that the rich have already built. That is, poorer countries can incorporate the already-invented technology to achieve economic growth. Incorporation is cheaper, easier, and a more reliable source of growth than is invention. That is why poorer countries have the potential to grow faster than richer ones. Here, relative backwardness counts as an advantage. The propensity of the poor to catch up with the rich in per capita output is well known among economists, who call it &ldquo;convergence.&rdquo;&nbsp; All other things being equal, over time the per capita outputs of different countries tend to converge.</p>\n<p class="p2">Convergence is a tendency, not an iron law of economic history. It is not automatic: all other things are not always equal. Indeed, from the beginning of the Industrial Revolution until well into the twentieth century, the opposite trend &mdash; divergence in per capita output between the rich and the poor &mdash; dominated global economic life. The poorer countries lacked the institutions needed to capitalize on the advances of the rich, and so the gap between them widened. The worldwide embrace of free markets in the latter part of the twentieth century represents a turning point in economic history because so many large, relatively poor countries did ultimately adopt the requisite institutions. As a result, their rates of economic growth increased; convergence shifted into high gear.</p>\n<p class="p2">In the third era of global economic integration, poorer countries have achieved higher growth rates than their trilateral counterparts, and that trend can be expected to continue, both because of the difficulties trilateral economies will face and because of the ongoing process of convergence. Non-Western countries have the potential to grow much faster than Western ones, but how fast they actually do grow will depend on the extent to which, having provided themselves with the necessary free-market institution, they proceed to adopt and carry out the policies that enable them to maximize their economic performances. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Adding workers is an element of the extensive method of economic growth, in which higher output stems from increasing inputs &mdash;land, labor, and capital. Intensive growth, by contrast, expands output by making more efficient use of a country&rsquo;s repertory of inputs. The term for greater efficiency is productivity, and productivity, economists have shown, is a key to economic advance.</p>\n<p class="p2">&nbsp; Although productivity can be measured, how greater productivity comes about remains imperfectly understood. It is well understood that new technology makes an important contribution to it; and in this respect the trilateral countries labor under a handicap. They already use the most advanced technology. They invented it. In order to increase growth they have to devise, develop, and incorporate new and improved techniques and machines. That is an uncertain process, the pace of which varies for reasons that are not known. That pace cannot easily be accelerated, and in any event is almost always gradual. There is some evidence, moreover, that the rate of productive technological innovation has slowed in recent decades, although there is no widely accepted account of why this has happened or even unanimity that it has happened at all.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Insights</strong></span></p>\n<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Making work lucrative</strong></span></p>\n<p class="p1">It is a known fact that employee satisfaction enhances retention and motivational level of the workforce.

(96, 12, '', 'Gambling on growth', '<p class="p1">In the run-up to the FY15 Budget, the expectation was of many big bangs. Instead, what the economy seems to have got is many little bangs. The middle class got a token tax exemption. Farmers got a national market for farm produce, Rs 8 lakh crore by way of farm credit, a Rs 5,000 crore warehousing fund and a Rs 500 crore price stabilisation fund.&nbsp; To revive manufacturing, companies got an expanded investment allowance and medium and small businesses got a Rs 10,000 crore venture capital fund.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;While presenting his maiden budget, finance minister Arun Jaitley very clearly has made the most of the positive sentiment around the NDA government. Now that there have been no big bangs, most market analysts are being chided for having unrealistic expectations from a government that has been just sworn in. &ldquo;It is good with respect to whatever little time he had&rdquo;, goes a popular defence. &ldquo;This is only the semi-final, the final will be in end-February 2015&rdquo;, goes another.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Those having high expectations may feel thwarted by the budget but the finance minister himself seems to be playing for a totally unrealistic target in terms of the fiscal deficit not only for FY15 but also the years thereafter. His grand proclamation in the Budget speech, &ldquo;My predecessor has set up a very difficult task of reducing fiscal deficit to 4.1% of GDP in the current year. Considering that we had two years of low GDP growth, an almost static industrial growth, a moderate increase in indirect taxes, a large subsidy burden and not so encouraging tax buoyancy, the target of 4.1% is indeed daunting. Difficult as it may appear, I have decided to accept this target as a challenge. My road map for fiscal consolidation is a fiscal<br /> deficit of 3.6% for FY16 and 3%&nbsp;for FY17.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Unclear roadmap</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;The budget being a statement of the spendthrift government&rsquo;s finances, the biggest item of interest is the fiscal deficit. While the targeted number is an ambitious one, there is no clarity on how it will be achieved. &ldquo;If wishes were horses, beggars would ride&rdquo; is an old English proverb that points to the futility of daydreaming. The finance minister sticking to the 4.1% target not only plays to the gallery of analysts and rating agencies but his bravado also takes into account that the market itself is discounting a more realistic 4.5% of GDP or even higher. For now, the rating agencies have maintained a polite fa&ccedil;ade, only murmuring that more details could have been provided about how various subsidies would be dealt with in FY15.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Rajeev Malik, senior economist, CLSA, says it is highly unlikely that the fiscal deficit target of 4.1% of GDP will be met. &ldquo;The number was unachievable when the former finance minister announced it; it remains so. The budget would have been more credible if greater necessary adjustments had been made. Not having more specifics on fixing the subsidy mess was disappointing. The subsidy bill cannot be open-ended and what is spent should also be better targeted.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The finance minister&rsquo;s gamble is even bigger considering that the previous government&rsquo;s eyewash had more to do with reducing plan expenditure and under-reporting subsidies. Thus, at the cost of growth and deferred entries, the fiscal deficit was reduced from 5.7% in FY12 to 4.5% in FY14. If this mathematical jugglery was not enough, the outgoing government then decided to project a fiscal deficit of 4.1% in FY15, a legacy that the current finance minister decided to accept as a &lsquo;challenge&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Either the FM will have to cut spending or justify slippage while ensuring a constructive budget in Feb" - Rajeev malik, senior economist, CLSA</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;He is now banking on a growth revival to meet this challenge. The assumptions naturally are rosy and prime among them is the near 20% growth expected in tax collections. This assumption of buoyant collections is despite creaky growth, a weak monsoon and lack of clarity on GST implementation. Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist, Crisil, says, &ldquo;The targeted tax collection is unlikely to happen in a weak growth environment, which is why we feel the fiscal deficit will be closer to 4.5%.&rdquo; Malik of CLSA agrees, &ldquo;The optimistic tax revenue assumption is what makes achieving the fiscal deficit target less credible. Either the FM will have to cut spending or justify a slight slippage while ensuring a more constructive budget in February based on expectations of improved outlook, as growth in FY16 will rebound sharply.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Cashing in&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Divestment is the one wild card that the skeptics may not have factored in, with respect to the fiscal deficit of 4.1%. Through stake sales in PSUs over the next eight months, the government aims to raise Rs 43,425 crore of the overall #63,625 crore divestment target. Right now, despite the resurgent fear of instability in the Eurozone, sentiment is unabashedly bullish and investors seem willing to throw money at every kind of paper.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">If this sentiment stays, given its strong mandate, the government might decide to make the most of it if tax revenues fall short. Malik says, &ldquo;Whether or not the divestment target can be met will be a function of the buoyancy in the market. In fact, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it surprises positively.&rdquo; Abhay Laijawala, head of research, Deutsche Equities, points out that the pace of selling from domestic institutions has slowed considerably and they could well turn out to be net buyers in the months to come. If that indeed happens, it will provide an additional fillip.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;Laijawala is also confident that the government will figure out a way to rationalise subsidies by making diesel prices market-based. He is hoping that a fortuitous drop in crude prices will help in reducing the deficit. &ldquo;The budget has factored in a price of $110 a barrel, which has actually fallen to $106 a barrel. If crude continues to be benign and goes further lower, under recoveries will be much less and that itself will provide significant leeway,&rdquo; he adds. Joshi does not have as sanguine a view and given the hostility in west Asia, his skepticism is understandable. &ldquo;A potential spike in the price of crude oil is a big risk, be it for the current account, inflation or the fiscal deficit. We are fortunate that despite the turmoil, crude has not moved much as the US has reduced import dependence through shale gas. But it is an uneasy calm,&rdquo; he cautions.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"A likely spike in crude oil prices is a big risk, be it for the current account inflation or fiscal deficit" - Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist, Crisil</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;And even if it decides to rationalise fuel subsidy, how much can a government that has promised <em>achhe din</em> increase diesel or LPG prices without stoking already high inflation? Not only will it bite into household budgets, even food prices at restaurants and food joints will go up as they are major consumers of LPG cylinders diverted from households. Taming high inflation will continue to be tricky, believes Joshi, &ldquo;Sustaining low inflation is a tough task. Assuming a partial monsoon failure, we expect GDP to grow by about 5.5% in FY15. Even on low growth, our inflation has remained high due to supply-side shocks.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Poll hurdle&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;Any hike, be it in LPG or diesel prices, will have to wait till the assembly elections in Maharashtra, Delhi and Haryana are done and over with. That could be well till October or even beyond that date. It effectively means that any further reduction in fuel subsidy in FY15 can well be ruled out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Then, given that the monsoon has not been normal this year, any steps to reduce fertiliser subsidy could well be perceived as anti-farmer. All this could well roll into FY16 where, surprise, the deficit target is 3.6%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Beyond the budget, there is a lot that the government can do in the form of executive education" - Abhay Laijawala, head of research, Deutsche Equities</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;As it is, given its cash-strapped position, the government really isn&rsquo;t in a position to provide additional stimulus to spur growth. Now that this year&rsquo;s action plan is short on specifics, the hope is that much action will happen outside the budget. &ldquo;Beyond the budget, there is a lot that the government can do in the form of executive decisions. If we see acceleration in project clearance, there could be a tailwind of confidence,&rdquo; says Laijawala.

Started in March 2014, within two months, the company raised Rs 103 crore, with the partners investing Rs 22-23 crore and the balance coming from 60-odd investors in India. &ldquo;We wanted to create a fund with capital coming from India and a broad base of investors,&rdquo; says Pai. It was a deliberate decision to keep the fund size small because otherwise, &ldquo;the fund manager becomes happy and satiated with the fees. We wanted to incentivise them to focus more on growth and exits rather than fees.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While all four partners will mentor entrepreneurs and there will be consensus on the companies they will choose to back, the fund will be run by Ghorpade, who will take care of the commercial aspects, and Chinnu Senthilkumar, who will manage the technology side of things. Senthilkumar has over two decades of experience working in hi-tech companies such as Sandisk, Intel and Texas Instruments, both in the US and India, and has some nine US patents to his name in semiconductor design and hardware systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Finding the gap</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">So, what is Exfinity&rsquo;s brief? Essentially, the fund is looking to fill the gap after angel funding but before Series A funding. &ldquo;If you look at the spectrum of investments today, angel funding up to Rs 1-2 crore is available and there are large funds that do Series A investments of $5-20 million (Rs 30-120 crore). The sweet spot is between Rs 2-3 crore and Rs 10-12 crore and that is a good gap for us to play in. Post angel funding, companies need to scale up before they become Series A ready and we can help them do that,&rdquo; says Ghorpade.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Post angel funding, firms need to scale up before they become Series A ready and we can help them do that" - Shailesh Ghorpade, managing partner and CIO, Reservoir Investment Managers</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Initially, the fund is looking at taking a 10-20% stake in companies, where Exfinity will invest individually or co-invest with other firms. As companies scale up, it will look to consolidate its position in the following Series A round and exit investments in the next &mdash; Series B &mdash; round. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want entrepreneurs to become employees because we are diluting their stake at every investment round. We want entrepreneurs to have enough skin in the game at all times,&rdquo; explains Senthilkumar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We don''t want entrepreneurs to become employees. We want them to have more skin in the game" - Chinnu Senthilkumar, CTO, Reservoir Investment Managers</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Exfinity is looking to invest the money it has raised in about 10-11 companies over the next 15-18 months. Ideally, the partners would like to invest in companies where proof of concept has been established, the first few customers are in and a revenue stream has been established. The focus will be on companies that use technology to create products and platforms, mostly in the B2B space. &ldquo;Not that we will not invest in companies in the B2C space, but we understand the B2B space better, given the experience of all our partners. We know what it takes to scale a business in this space,&rdquo; says Senthilkumar. While most investments are likely to be in what is now popularly called SMAC (social media, mobility, analytics and cloud) technologies, the company has zeroed in on some interesting options in other areas as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Take the case of the fund&rsquo;s very first investment, Virtual Power Systems. This Silicon Valley-based start-up has developed virtualisation software that will dramatically reduce power costs in data centre, bringing down overall costs substantially. Started in 2012, it has managed to raise more than $5 million in funding so far, including the latest Series A round of $4 million from Vinod Dham, who invested in his personal capacity, and Exfinity. Shankar Ramamurthy, CEO of Virtual Power Systems, says the firm saw Exfinity as a more strategic investor rather than a financial investor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;We plan to launch the product in the Asian markets by the end of next year. We wanted strategic investors with a strong presence and network in these markets who will help us define our go-to-market strategy,&rdquo; adds Ramamurthy.</p>\n<p class="p3">The fund has also shortlisted two other investments &mdash; a start-up in Mumbai that develops unmanned aerial vehicles and an analytics firm in Bengaluru. The partners, though, prefer to keep mum on the details until the deals are finalised.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>The right fit</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Will tech veterans who handled billion-dollar businesses really understand the pain points of a start-up? &ldquo;We started relatively small and struggled to get our first international customer and million-dollar order. While that happened some years ago, we have gone through that phase and it is not unfamiliar to us,&rdquo; says Paranjpe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The partners also believe that since most companies they will invest in are likely to go after global markets, their experience in building global business will come in handy. &ldquo;For product companies, global exposure is very important. We don&rsquo;t always package and market our products correctly even if we have quality. In the product business, the manual is as important as the product itself,&rdquo; says Ghaisas. It&rsquo;s a subject he knows a thing or two about: Ghaisas was one of the key members at i-flex, one of the most successful product companies to come out of India, which was acquired by Oracle in 2005. Ghaisas believes one of the biggest factors that contributed to i-flex&rsquo;s success was the fact that it built the product not to fit Indian banking standards but against global benchmarks. Similarly, he says,&ldquo;We can help entrepreneurs build products that can be universal rather than creating something for India and then force-fitting them into the global environment.&rdquo; Such inputs at the conceptualisation stage would result in saving much time and effort for the entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p class="p3">The passion and excitement is clear to see in all four partners. They want to give back to the industry, which they say has given them everything. &ldquo;We have had our place in the sun and look forward to help entrepreneurs become the next tech superstars,&rdquo; says Bala, who believes the next $100 billion in revenue for the tech industry is going to come from products and platforms, not services. With advice coming from the best in the industry, it is now time for India&rsquo;s tech start-ups to shine.&nbsp;</p>', 'A bunch of technology veterans have come together to fund and mentor start-ups with proven ideas and assured revenue streams', '6', '', 0, '', 'playing-the-big-daddy-98', 93, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Playing the big daddy', 'A bunch of technology ', '', '', '', 'Reservoir Investment Managers,Shailesh Ghorpade,Mohandas Pai,V Balakrishnan,Girish Paranjpe,Deepak Ghaisas,Exfinity Technology Fund,Chinnu Senthilkumar', 0, NULL, '2015-01-16 17:14:26', NULL, '2014-08-08', 0);

(99, 16, '', 'The star attraction', '<p class="p1">Would you buy a brand of plywood or cement because your favourite film star endorsed it or would you go with whatever your contractor recommended? What about opening a new bank account or choosing a travel website? There was a time when celebrities sold only soap and chocolate. Now, it&rsquo;s hard to find a billboard or TV screen that doesn&rsquo;t have a film star or cricketer&rsquo;s face plastered on it, selling almost everything under the sun.</p>\n<p class="p3">The jury is still out on whether celebrity advertising works or not. You have as many studies telling you that signing on a film star or sports hero makes absolutely no difference to the quarterly sales graph as you have ones that say there&rsquo;s a distinct increase in sales and brand recall. Even the gurus have divided opinions. Jack Trout has been vocal in his disapproval. &ldquo;My problem with advertising in India is that everybody wants to do Bollywood. That&rsquo;s because it is so much easier to do that than finding an interesting way to make the product a star,&rdquo; he said to <em>Outlook Business</em> last year. Grant McCracken is a little more forgiving. In his often-quoted essay, McCracken says &ldquo;&hellip;when celebrities are depicted in ads, they bring their own culturally related meanings, thereto, irrespective of the required promotional role.&rdquo; Take the middle path and it would still appear celebrity-led marketing is a hit-and-miss affair, at best.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Then why is it so popular in India? From 25% in 2001, the share of celebrity-led campaigns in total ad volume has climbed sharply to 64% in 2013, according to Manish Porwal, MD of media marketing company Alchemist Talent Solutions. Not all those ads are your usual FMCG brand promotions &mdash; although those remain the most popular. TAM India numbers for the top 10 categories for celebrity endorsements show that between January and March 2014, soap, shampoo, milk and soft drinks accounted for 25% of ad volume, while liquor, perfumes and paints accounted for just 3% each. Tellingly, these last three categories weren&rsquo;t even in the top 10 in the same period last year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Of late, you can see famous people shilling for banks, insurance, online services and even products where the consumer is not necessarily invested and involved in the product decision, such as cement and plywood. In the past year alone, yesteryear Bollywood baddies Prem Chopra, Shakti Kapoor and Ranjeet appeared in a campaign for Havells wires, Katrina Kaif became the brand ambassador for Johnson Tiles and, most recently, Nana Patekar endorsed Century Ply. Shilpa Shetty is pushing Exo dishwashing bars, Irrfan Khan has been dancing with skimpily-clad women for Arise television and comeback queen Madhuri Dixit has signed on as the face of Oral-B and Maggi. (<em>see: Dancing with the stars</em>)</p>\n<p class="p3">So, is it just lazy advertising or does celebrity advertising serve a purpose? &ldquo;All too often, we see celebrities being used as a replacement for the lack of ideas,&rdquo; complains Sonal Dabral, chairman and CEO, DDB Mudra. The veteran adman isn&rsquo;t against brand ambassadors &mdash; he uses them frequently, most recently in the Century Plywood campaign with Nana Patekar. What he&rsquo;s protesting is indiscriminately tossing them around like confetti. &ldquo;Celebrities do add some value to the brand. When you hire someone to endorse your brand for the right reasons, no one is expensive or cheap, just valuable. In the case of Century Plywood, our messaging would have been weaker without Patekar.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Dancing with the stars - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Others point to the numerous advantages of bringing a well-known face on board. Jagdeep Kapoor, marketing veteran and founder-CMD, Samsika Marketing, says, &ldquo;While not having a celebrity does not make your campaign ineffective, having a convincing one lends credibility to your campaign.&rdquo; Besides, image is everything when a celebrity is hired for a particular campaign. &ldquo;Aamir Khan is widely known as a perfectionist. His presence in the Godrej ad was not just for the sake of the brand but also to lend his own values to the brand by his presence,&rdquo; says Porwal. Similarly, Rajiv Anand, president, retail banking at Axis&nbsp;Bank, says Deepika Padukone&rsquo;s age and success in the film industry without the aid of a legacy was why she was chosen to headline the bank&rsquo;s recent campaign.</p>\n<p class="p3">And non-consumer brands insist that the reasoning holds true even for their products. Century, for instance, is exuberant at having signed on the usually reclusive Patekar. &ldquo;We wanted to take the category to the consumers and increase affinity for it. Since Patekar had never appeared in an ad before, he would obviously bring in more attention to the brand,&rdquo; says Amit Kumar Gope, marketing head, Century Plywood. Adds Dabral, &ldquo;In a heavy influencer category, we wanted to change the conversation to more than just plywood. During their pitch, our creative team said this campaign would be incomplete without Nana. He has a quirky personality and would be acceptable as the &lsquo;voice of conscience&rsquo; in the campaign.&rdquo; Both client and agency agree that the aim is not just to meet a financial target but to work on an image of the brand as more than just a commodity.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Not small change</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Still, a celebrity endorser is an expensive way to build brand image. The top Bollywood stars charge anywhere upward of Rs 5 crore per endorsement, while cricketers don&rsquo;t come for anything less than a couple of crore each. Top-billed male actors earn in tens of crore per deal, while lesser known or newer stars earn anywhere between two lakh and a crore, depending on the stature of the brand. But brands justify the expense by pointing to reduced media cost. &ldquo;You need fewer spots to establish your campaign with a recognisable face,&rdquo; points out Porwal. Kapoor explains, &ldquo;A 10-second spot on a primetime show costs Rs 2.5 lakh. When you have a celebrity campaign, instead of running 100 spots, you can achieve the same impact with 20.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"You need fewer spots to establish your ad campaign with a recognisable face" - Manish Porwal, MD, Alchemist Talent Solutions</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Besides, adds Porwal, the impact of a celebrity-led campaign lasts longer. &ldquo;If a certain ad increases the impact of the brand by 1.5X, having a credible celebrity for two years pushes it to 6X or 7X,&rdquo; he says. Each organisation has its own ways of measuring the success of a campaign &mdash; either through brand image, recall and advocacy or through sales growth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In good times and bad, signing on a brand ambassador is the easy part, aver marketing experts. It&rsquo;s the decisions taken during the course of the association that are more nerve-wracking &mdash; do you stick with them through the ups and downs in their career or drop them like a hot potato at the sight of the first stumble? What do you do with your ambassador once they announce retirement or decide to take a sabbatical?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">This is where brand managers and agencies in India and the West differ. Celebrity reputations have taken a beating too frequently in the US in the past few years &mdash; Martha Stewart, Paula Deen, Lance Armstrong, Tiger Woods and Chris Brown, to name just a few &mdash; and it&rsquo;s an all too real worry that the brand&rsquo;s fortunes may dip with a fall in the stature of its ambassador. In almost all these cases, the brands concerned have quietly dissociated themselves from their heroes &mdash; Accenture let Woods go, Nike dropped Armstrong and Walmart waved adieu to Deen.</p>\n<p class="p3">In India, though, the general public is so much in awe of its superstars that it is perfectly willing to forgive them any transgressions. That is why Salman Khan and Saif Ali Khan continue to sell the products they do, despite court proceedings on against both for manslaughter and poaching, respectively. Some are used despite having quit their day jobs &mdash; retired cricketers Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar signed new deals with Gillette and Musafir.com, respectively, last year. Kapoor says, &ldquo;Brands hire retired or older celebrities because they are relevant, recognisable and more economical than younger stars.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The bigger risk in India, according to Kapoor, is that &ldquo;people make the mistake of placing the celebrity before the brand, which makes you lose sight of the campaign objective&rdquo;. Prime example: Virat Kohli&rsquo;s ad for Cinthol &mdash; where all we see are quick camera movements centred around Kohli&rsquo;s face with an incomprehensible tune playing in the background &mdash; or Akshay Kumar and Salman Khan for ThumsUp &mdash; 30 seconds of high-action stunts but nothing about the taste of the cola.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"People tend to place the celebrity before the brand and lose sight of the objective" - Jagdeep Kapoor, founder and CMD, Samsika Marketing</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">But brand and marketing experts unanimously agree that no amount of stardust can guarantee a rise in sales. Explains Kapoor, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more about the long-term effect the relationship has on your brand. Brand affinity is what we gain.&rdquo; Rajiv Sodhi, VP and MD of domain registrar and web hosting company GoDaddy.com, which recently signed on Mithun Chakraborty, adds that celebrity cost isn&rsquo;t an issue when the objective is to improve brand perception. &ldquo;Besides, one hopes that this campaign can be sustained over the years.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Bottomline: whether you paused that finger on the remote to watch what Padukone was promoting or because you were interested in her, brand managers and ad agencies don&rsquo;t care &mdash; as long as you remember the brand at the store aisle.&nbsp;</p>', 'Why celebrity endorsement is now becoming par for the course for advertisers', '16', '', 0, '', 'the-star-attraction-99', 94, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'The star attraction', 'Why celebrity endorsement is now becoming par for the course for advertisers', '', '', '', 'Celebrity endorsement,Marketing,Brand recall', 0, NULL, '2015-01-16 18:08:31', NULL, '2014-08-08', 0),
(100, 16, '', 'The road less travelled', '<p class="p1">When an elegant Isuzu truck arrived on a mid-June evening at Vadodara&rsquo;s Kirti Mandir area, it raised a few eyebrows among the 20-odd real estate company owners gathered there under the local Credai (Confederation of Real Estate Developers&rsquo; Associations of India) chapter. They had heard about the truck&rsquo;s previous visit a month earlier &mdash; when Godrej Locking Solutions &amp; Systems (Lockks) invited the city&rsquo;s architect and interior design community to experience first-hand the company&rsquo;s product range inside the truck &mdash; but nobody was expecting quite this. The air-conditioned interior came complete with soft LED lighting, plush sofas and mock-ups of kitchen and shower cubicles: a complete showroom on wheels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">The Godrej Lockss&rsquo; initiative got wholehearted approval at Vadodara. &ldquo;It was a unique experience as a customer,&rdquo; says Ragnesh Kalathia, director of RCA Procon, a local real estate developer. &ldquo;What I liked most was that the staff had been trained by the company.&rdquo; The 40x10 ft &lsquo;mobile experience centre&rsquo; (MEC) branded &ldquo;Innovation Express&rdquo; went on its first 73,200 km road trip last year, spending four or five days at each of the 62 cities it visited. On its second round, it is now covering new markets, and has clocked over 9,000 km already.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>B2B Floats- Image</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Snazzy exhibition trucks belting out loud music and inviting customers to walk in and experience the latest product is a common sight at malls and popular shopping centres, or even village <em>haats</em>. It&rsquo;s far less usual in the B2B space, where the buying process in industrial or institutional purchases involves a long gestation period &mdash; sometimes six months or more. While in some cases, senior executives or promoters visit a supplier&rsquo;s plant before deciding on ordering, and in consumer-oriented products, they can visit a company showroom, in most other industrial products, there is no such option. Then, suppliers provide testimonials or sometimes, even test run a piece of equipment at the client&rsquo;s premises. With advanced tech products, computer simulations are also used.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">But all these are options more frequently used with large, urban customers &mdash; small and medium enterprises, especially in smaller cities, rarely get access to such detailed product demos. And B2B marketing has been pretty staid and unchanged all these years &mdash; at best an exhibition/seminar inside manufacturing plants or a meet-and-greet for buyers and category influencers at some five-star hotel. Now, it&rsquo;s getting a dose of marketing ingenuity with experiential marketing. Companies in the industrial products space are taking their sales pitch right to their customers&rsquo; doorsteps &mdash; industrial areas and factory premises &mdash; to create a connect with potential buyers and generate buzz.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>Breaking and entering</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">Opting for floats <em>&agrave; la</em> consumer products helps B2B companies achieve several objectives. At Godrej Lockss, for instance, the MEC helps the company showcase its products directly to the influencer group, architects and interior decorators. &ldquo;They are often involved with multiple projects with limited knowledge of brands,&rdquo; says Shyam Motwani, executive vice-president and business head, Godrej Lockss. &ldquo;The value of the purchase they influence is pretty large, running into lakhs.&rdquo; Builders, architects and decorators typically depend on hardware stores for accessories such as latches, door handles and locks. As can be expected, the range in such stores is limited and the sales staff not always perfectly knowledgeable about the products. &ldquo;Architects want to be able to visualise how products look in a contemporary environment,&rdquo; points out Motwani.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">That doesn&rsquo;t always happen in showrooms. Kalathia points to the typical experience: &ldquo;You ask questions and the shopkeeper simply hands over brochures and tries to divert you to other brands.&rdquo; The Lockss MEC, on the other hand, was all about touch-and-feel. &ldquo;I could pick up a [door] handle and ask about its internal mechanism. I got technical details straight from the manufacturer and a better sense of their delivery schedules.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p2">For the company, too, an MEC is a better option than a showroom simply considering the finances involved. Motwani estimates that the cost of operating a 2,500 sq ft brick-and-mortar company-owned showroom, including rentals, fit-outs and maintenance, can be as much as five times that of running a float. Besides, the reach of such a vehicle is multiple times that of a showroom &mdash; most initiatives carry on three to five years, covering several hundred cities and companies; footfalls at a brick-and-mortar showroom may not ever match those numbers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"This exercise has obviated the need for advertising and setting up brick and mortar showrooms" - Shyam Motwani, executive VP, Godrej Lockss</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The Rs 550-crore Godrej Lockss commands a 15% share of the locks and locking solutions market and Motwani claims the company is growing twice as fast as the category. The company is expected to close FY15 with revenue of over Rs 600 crore, but the larger goal is to take this 10-fold in eight years. It is a strong player in the fast-growing security and advanced locking solutions segment, where it competes with brands such as Europa and Dorset. The MEC experience has worked for the brand, says Motwani. &ldquo;We have had a few hundred crore worth of enquiries, which we are now pursuing. This exercise has served multiple objectives for us. It has completely obviated the need for advertising in trade journals and setting up brick-and-mortar showrooms and we have been able to convert fence-sitters to decide on our brands,&rdquo; he adds. That explains why Lockss is expanding the MEC initiative &mdash; the company plans to add three trucks to the two already in operation.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>On the road</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">Industrial product companies find it exceptionally tough to reach their customers through conventional channels.&nbsp; Advertising on television and radio gets dissipated as does communication through regular print publications. Trade journals are the only option, then, and it hasn&rsquo;t proved as effective of late, due to the rise of online media options. &ldquo;We have limited access to resources, unlike FMCG companies,&rdquo; says Ramanan Viswanathan, head, marketing, Grundfos Pumps India. &ldquo;If we conduct a seminar, our customers need to invest four or five hours of their personal time planning, commuting, attending and listening to our presentations. Mobile experiential exhibitions are proving effective as we reach the customers&rsquo; premises at their convenience.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Mobile experiential exhibitions are more effective as we reach customers at their own convenience" - Ramanan Viswanathan, head, marketing, Grundfos Pumps India</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">In 2010, the Danish pump maker embarked on the grandly-named Incredible Indian Pump Yatra. The first campaign lasted 19 months and the next, with a smaller vehicle, for six months, receiving a total of around 25,000 visitors. The original 40-ft open format trailer truck was staffed by a local distributor, products and sales teams, and had around 150 visitors a day. Parked at a common area in industrial zones or large factories, the float displayed some pumping systems and played audio-visuals on product features and benefits. &ldquo;It was not only to create awareness but also build relationships. The primary challenge was access to the market,&rdquo; says Viswanathan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">The Rs 340-crore (FY14 turnover) Grundfos Pumps India caters to industrial enterprises and used the MEC to visit large factories where it demonstrated its products&rsquo; energy-saving capabilities. It was a successful campaign, says Viswanathan. &ldquo;We spent around Rs 1 crore on one of the campaigns where we were able to generate 30% growth in sales.&rdquo; As it targets over Rs 400 crore in sales, a more advanced, air-conditioned version of the float will be rolled out for a new campaign in couple of months, he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>Getting there first</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">Reaching out to customers directly also helps in some measure in fighting competition. And with the Chinese onslaught extending to B2B categories, as well as growing interest of global players in the Indian players, incumbents are looking to secure their territories any way they can. Industrial major Siemens, for instance, is facing the heat from not just big players such as Schneider Electric, ABB, Fanuc or Mitsubishi for a slice of the small business pie, but also imports from China. It is also battling a mindset that it is beyond the reach of SMEs. &ldquo;We are seen as a company that makes products mainly for the big guys but that is not correct,&rdquo; says Bhaskar Mandal, executive vice-president and sector cluster lead, industry sector, South Asia, Siemens.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">In April 2013, the German major rolled out a mobile road show, christened the Productivity Tour, to tackle just this. The road show, which will complete its tour of India by the end of this year, has so far covered 130 cities in 14 states, reaching out to around 4,000 B2B clients and receiving more than 23,000 footfalls. The chief objective: face-to-face communication with all those directly involved in the purchase and use of its industrial automation products, such as business owners, technicians, plant managers, procurement teams and maintenance engineers. The message: how Siemens&rsquo; products could help step up productivity for smaller industrial units and pay for themselves over their life cycle. &ldquo;Technology penetration in SMEs is quite low. Our idea is to reach out and show them how we can improve the efficiency of their production and business processes,&rdquo; says Mandal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">At each location, the truck spends a couple of days and is accompanied by the sales engineer for the territory, who is trained in selling solutions and technical servicing. The route and contacts are planned three months in advance, with the current status of the truck updated daily on a dedicated website. Local PR agencies and outdoor advertisements help spread the word about the tour, which intensifies through word-of-mouth once the MEC reaches a location. &ldquo;We were unsure if the infrastructure and connectivity across India would make it feasible for a 40-ft truck to go into the hinterland,&rdquo; says Mandal. &ldquo;The first reaction was &lsquo;wow&rsquo;. People told us they&rsquo;ve never seen something like this before.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p2">Among the products showcased in the truck is Siemens&rsquo; Sinamics range of motion control drives that help regulate the speed of a motor in production and can lead to energy cost savings of 30-40%. Also on display are other products such as computer numerical control solutions to automate tooling machines and the totally integrated automation concept that connects an industrial unit&rsquo;s shopfloor seamlessly to its existing IT platform, enabling remote monitoring of production processes. &ldquo;In this category, demonstrated benefits are more important than claimed benefits. This was the principal insight that prompted us to launch this road show,&rdquo; says Mandal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"In this category, demonstrated benefits are far more important than claimed benefits" - Bhaskar Mandal, executive VP, south Asia, Siemens</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">It may be too soon to demonstrate the benefits of this exercise, but at least it&rsquo;s got customers&rsquo; attention. Narsaiah Gudi, partner at Crown Industries in Prashantpur Industrial Area in Kukatpally, Hyderabad, runs a small unit that manufactures machines used in the packaging products industry, both for domestic and export markets. The Rs 2.5-crore company is already a Siemens&rsquo; customer having installed its drives in the unit. Gudi, a veteran in the business for 25 years has seen it all &mdash; from exhibitions and seminars in star hotels to conferences. He finds a marked difference in what Siemens is trying to do now. &ldquo;This time they came with new, more economical products such as servo and frequency drives that are suitable for smaller manufacturers like us,&rdquo; he says. The time-saving aspect of this concept is what appealed most to Gudi. &ldquo;If we go to HiTec City it&rsquo;s a one-and-a-half hour journey, then more time there. Here, within half-an-hour we can see the products, get our queries answered and get back to our work.&rdquo; Gudi hasn&rsquo;t yet made up his mind on placing a fresh order with Siemens, but it has set him thinking.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>&lsquo;Made in India&rsquo;</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">Another company that is finding floats a handy weapon to battle Chinese dragons is Havells. The Noida-based maker of industrial electrical switchgear, cables and lighting products has been battling a fiercely competitive market dominated by multinational brands and low-cost Chinese imports. With the result that, says Sunil Sikka, president, Havells, the company&rsquo;s industrial categories have been growing at marginal single digits for the past couple of years, which is not helped by an overall slowdown in the infrastructure and power generation sectors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Further, the bulk of potential industrial buyers, though, is not as informed. Purchase of electrical goods for commercial and residential projects and manufacturing plants is driven by key influencers such as architects and project consultants, who guide what brand is used in their projects, whether industrial, commercial or residential. &ldquo;To convince and influence specifiers is tough,&rdquo; says Sikka.</p>\n<p class="p2">That&rsquo;s where the Havells industrial products (IP) van comes in. A 10.75-ft Eicher truck, it first rolled out in September 2011 and has covered 200 cities over an 80,000-km run in 604 activity days, contacting over 2,300 companies.

Havells says it can track several advantages to the initiative. &ldquo;Lead times have come down from seven-eight months to four-five months.

His Rs 40-crore company makes electrical control panels for industrial and residential use, which require switchgear like Havells makes. The standard practice in the trade is to present the manufacturer&rsquo;s offerings through a catalogue, from which the buyer makes a choice.&nbsp; Goel remembers the van visiting his office on MM Road in Jhandewalan some eight months ago. &ldquo;Seeing is believing,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;One could see the quality, finish and workmanship of the products, which cannot be conveyed on paper.&rdquo; As with Siemens, the translation into sales hasn&rsquo;t happened immediately but Goel says he will keep the brand and its quality in mind for future decisions. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>In the long run</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">It&rsquo;s experiences like this that increase the popularity of marketing floats with B2B companies.&nbsp; Benny Mohan, chief marketing officer at Bengaluru-based Wings Brand Activations, a new player in this space, points to the novelty of such initiatives in the industrial products space. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a client where it had led to amazing feedback and several orders,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p2">But creating and running a fully-equipped mobile exhibition trailer doesn&rsquo;t come cheap. Industry sources say that building a large float costs Rs 40-50 lakh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Priya Monga, co-founder of Delhi-based experiential marketing firm RC&amp;M, which has been executing many such campaigns, gives more detailed estimates. The cost of a one-year engagement of large-format (45 ft) trailers and buses is roughly Rs 1.5 crore, including fabrication and fitouts, operation and maintenance, for covering 1,000 touch points. For smaller vans such as the ones used by Havells, it could cost as little as Rs 12 lakh a year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Typically, firms hire marketing services agencies on a turnkey basis, to organise everything from fabrication to the operations. They pay a monthly fee for the exercise, which could run up to five years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">The biggest challenge is to track the activity of a marketing float. &ldquo;It is a manpower-intensive, vehicle-based advertising activity going from city to city. The rules, permits, taxes, etc., are different in each place. Moreover, the vehicles are on the road for a very long time, so compliance on vehicle fitness and road transport rules has to be very strong,&rdquo; says Monga. Tracking is done through GPS, monitoring through live streaming video on demand, and by telephone. &ldquo;We have separate account managers for each activity, conducting surprise checks as well,&rdquo; she adds.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"It is a vehicle-based activity with different rules, permits and taxes in each place it visits" - Priya Monga, co-founder, RC&amp;M</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">It&rsquo;s not always smooth sailing, though. &ldquo;The infrastructure in industrial zones are pathetic. Parking and permissions are other issues,&rdquo; says Siemens&rsquo; Mandal. Grundfos&rsquo; Viswanathan says that apart from the challenges of moving across the country, planning and scheduling of the MEC&rsquo;s movement demands 24X7 involvement of the sales and marketing teams. That&rsquo;s difficult since most companies insist there is no commercial target attached to the MEC at present. Also, it&rsquo;s not easy to bring a goal-driven sales team on board with the idea; they have to be convinced of the long-term benefits.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Some see the interest in MECs as another customer outreach exercise, but on a more sophisticated level. Others find it innovative in the industrial buying context. &ldquo;This is investing ahead of the curve,&rdquo; says Bengaluru-based brand consultant Harish Bijoor. &ldquo;For now, it may be evangelical, but later it will get more commercial.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Whether this travelling circus of industrial workers continues to charm buyers remains to be seen.

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have pumped in about $10 billion into equities in 2014 so far and that rocket fuel has powered the Sensex to a new high. Now, everyone wants to get on the gravy train. How does one otherwise explain the net inflow of Rs 9,969 crore into equity mutual funds in the first quarter of FY15? To put that number in context, the cumulative net inflow of May and June (Rs 9,761 crore) exceeds the net outflow of Rs 7,627 crore in FY14.

Shah disagrees. &ldquo;Investors entering the market now are seasoned campaigners who exited earlier and are re-entering.

(103, 20, '', 'A very slippery business', '<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s like a two decade-long engagement that ends with the bride left standing at the altar. But this isn&rsquo;t the plot of a <em>Great Expectations</em>-ish classic tearjerker novel. It&rsquo;s more of a reality show, featuring the Ruias of Essar Oil in the starring role as they decide to break their courtship with minority shareholders after raising money from them 19 years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The story began in 1995 when the company issued an IPO to set up a refinery at Vadinar in Jamnagar district, Gujarat. At the time, the state government was offering companies a five-year sales tax break if they set up units there. Essar Oil claimed it would start the refinery by 1998, but a cyclone that year ravaged the coast of Gujarat, in turn delaying the project. In April 2002, the management informed the state government that considerable time was lost in reassessment; construction would begin in June 2002 and production by November 2004; and asked for an extension of the tax holiday. This time, environmental clearances caused a delay and the company could not start the refinery until 2006.</p>\n<p class="p3">Meanwhile, in 2004, Essar Oil was referred to the corporate debt restructuring cell and it was only nine years later, in 2013, that it emerged stronger, thanks to the benevolence of its lenders. The management openly acknowledged that; in an earlier interaction with <em>Outlook Business</em>, Lalit Kumar Gupta, Essar Oil MD and CEO, said, &ldquo;Had it not been for the collective wisdom of lenders, we wouldn&rsquo;t have achieved what we have today.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The refinery, which finally commenced commercial production in May 2008, initially with a capacity of 10.5 million metric tonne per annum (mmtpa), was upgraded to 20 mmtpa with an increased complexity to process various grades of crude. In the same article, the company&rsquo;s CFO, too, credited bankers for their foresight. &ldquo;Refineries had to scale up their operations to meet the new environmental standards and just processing light crude wouldn&rsquo;t have ensured long-term viability of a refinery. The lenders invested an additional Rs 4,600 crore in tranches during the course of the restructuring and that ensured long-term viability of the project,&rdquo; said Suresh Jain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Since FY08, Essar Oil&rsquo;s net sales have climbed from Rs 652 crore to Rs 98,353 crore in FY14, and it swung back into the black with a net profit of Rs 126 crore in FY14 from a loss of Rs 42 crore in FY08. In other words, just when a spanking world-class refinery is getting into the groove and churning up profits, the promoters decide to do away with minority shareholders. Essar Oil&rsquo;s promoter company, Essar Energy Holdings (EEHL), intends to buy back the 9.46% public shareholding at Rs 108.15 per share, a marginal premium to the current market price of Rs 106. Minority shareholders are, not surprisingly, upset and market observers are critical of the Ruias&rsquo; delisting a company just when it starts performing well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>A tale of two delistings</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The Mumbai-based Essar Oil is the Essar group&rsquo;s flagship company, with interests in oil exploration and production and crude oil refining. Twelve years after it listed on the BSE, the Ruias first attempted to delist the company, at the same time as they delisted another group company, Essar Steel. The Essar Steel bid was successful, but the management scrapped its plan for Essar Oil. Instead, it chose to issue global depository shares (GDRs) to the promoters on a preferential basis, at an effective price of Rs 200 per share.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Interestingly, the Ruias created an indirect holding structure in Essar Oil. Currently, EEHL, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2010, holds 90.54% stake in the company. EEHL, which has interests in Essar Oil and Essar Power, is, in turn, owned by Essar Global, which is owned by the Ruias. Pre IPO, EEHL had invested $293.3 million via GDRs in Essar Oil, which reduced the public free-float of Essar Oil to 10.6%. Post IPO, EEHL invested another $225 million via GDRs, which further reduced the public free-float of Essar Oil to 10.04%. In December 2013, EEHL converted the entire holding of FCCBs into equity, further reducing the public free-float of Essar Oil to 9.46%. The holding structure was, in fact, highlighted as one of the risks in EEHL&rsquo;s IPO prospectus, which stated the group has &ldquo;a complex structure and a lack of clarity on the flow of funds between the UK unit and its Indian subsidiaries&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Though the EEHL IPO raised nearly <span class="s1">&pound;</span>1.3 billion at 420 pence a share, the buoyancy did not last for long as the share price fell to 55 pence by February 2014. If investors were still waiting for the good times to roll in, they were in for a shock. Earlier this year, Essar Global, EEHL&rsquo;s parent company, chose to delist the company instead of complying with the FTSE-imposed rule that mandated a minimum 25% free float by March 2014: the move would have entailed a 3% reduction in stake for EEHL&rsquo;s promoters. At 70 pence a share, the delisting offer did not go down well with minority shareholders. Though an independent committee led by non-executive director Philip Aiken argued that the <span class="s1">&pound;</span>900-million bid &ldquo;materially&rdquo; undervalued the company, it could not do much since the Ruias had won acceptances from nearly two-fifths of the minority shareholders since launching the formal offer in March, enabling Essar Global to increase its stake in EEHL from 78% to 86%. Finally, in June this year, EEHL was delisted from the London Stock Exchange.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Before all this, though, back home, the Ruias had been fighting court battles. In the case of Essar Oil, the Gujarat government turned down the sales tax rebate of Rs 6,165 crore for the refinery since the company did not start operations within the stipulated period. Essar Oil moved the state high court, which ruled in its favour, but the state government contested the ruling in the Supreme Court and won a ruling in its favour in November 2013. Meanwhile, the Ruias got embroiled in the 2G spectrum scam case. The stock price came under pressure and fell to Rs 46 by March 2013.</p>\n<p class="p3">Towards the second half of FY14, Essar Oil seemed to be over the hump, as it recorded the highest gross refining margin of $9.33 per barrel in Q3FY14. It ended the year achieving its highest ever throughput of 20.23 mmt, and PAT of Rs 124 crore against a loss of Rs 1,180 crore the previous year. The Vadinar refinery operating above 100% capacity promises even stronger revenues in the coming years, believe analysts. Not surprisingly, then, they&rsquo;ve been largely bullish on the Essar Oil stock. In May when the price was quoting at Rs 77 levels, Macquaire gave a buy rating with a Rs 115 target price; Edelweiss gave a target price of Rs 93, while Deutsche Bank predicted a price of Rs 97 for the stock.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Rallying cry</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Good results are only part of the story behind the rally in the Essar Oil stock. The market was buzzing with rumours of the stock delisting from Indian bourses for several months before the formal announcement in June. Fanning the flames was the Ruias&rsquo; decision to delist EEHL. Though the company initially denied to the exchanges any intimation from the promoters on delisting, the stock rose steadily, with the price hitting a high of Rs 117 on June 11. Finally, on June 23, Essar Oil announced it was delisting from Indian bourses by buying out the residual stake. Since the announcement, the stock fell 9% from its June 11 high.</p>\n<p class="p3">According to the management, the rationale behind the delisting was this: &ldquo;[EEHL] believes [Essar Oil] requires sustained, substantial investment to develop and grow its businesses (especially the refining and marketing business). Full ownership of the company will provide [EEHL] increased operational/financial flexibility to support the company&rsquo;s businesses and strategic needs.&rdquo; The management&rsquo;s standpoint was buttressed by Gupta&rsquo;s comments in a recent media interaction. &ldquo;Our rupee debt currently &mdash; if you include all sales tax etc. &mdash; is something about Rs 21,000 crore. We have no major capex going forward, we have always said this and, therefore, going forward whatever generations are there, they will be mostly to liquidate the debt only...&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Market observers aren&rsquo;t too happy with Essar&rsquo;s aggressive approach to delisting &mdash; and make no bones about their displeasure. &ldquo;Now, when the going is finally good and expected to get better, Essar Oil&rsquo;s promoters are seeking to delist and throw out 350,000 shareholders,&rdquo; fumes Gaurav Parikh, managing director, Jeena Scriptech Alpha Advisors. He points to the company&rsquo;s CDR stint. &ldquo;The expansion of the refinery happened only with the support of banks, lenders, debenture holders and shareholders. Essar is denying shareholders the &lsquo;superior stakeholder value&rsquo; promised.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"When things are finally getting better, Essar Oil is seeking to delist and throw out 350,000 shareholders" - Gaurav Parikh, MD, Jeena Scriptech Alpha Advisors</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Others echo Parikh&rsquo;s views. Says JN Gupta, founder of Stakeholders Empowerment Services (SES) and a former director of Sebi, &ldquo;Investors who stuck to the company with a long-term horizon will be disappointed if the exit offer is successful as they will be forced to exit just when the good times are rolling in.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Long-term investors will be disappointed as just when the good times are rolling in, they will be forced to exit" - JN Gupta, founder, Stakeholders Empowerment Services</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">While the board of directors has given its consent to delisting, approval of shareholders is also required &mdash; and that may not be as easy to come by. According to a report by Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IIAS), &ldquo;The revised Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement and, in some instances, the Companies Act, prohibits controlling shareholders from voting on related party transactions, while allowing public shareholders to vote.&rdquo; That strengthens Essar&rsquo;s minority shareholders, says IIAS COO Hetal Dalal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"If all public shareholders vote, institutional investors along with retail shareholders can defeat the resolution" - Hetal Dalal, COO, Institutional Investor Advisory Services</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">She explains that approval for delisting is far more stringent than for most other resolutions and promoters cannot vote in the resolutions. This multiplies the vote of minority shareholders. A resolution for delisting is passed only by a two-third majority. &ldquo;In Essar Oil&rsquo;s case, promoters (not including promoter-owned GDRs sans voting rights) own 72.5%. Thus, the remaining 27.5% public shareholders will decide, increasing their voting power by more than 3.6X over their shareholding. Assuming all public shareholders vote, institutional investors (which hold 8.8% of the total shares) along with retail shareholders holding 0.5% shares, can defeat the resolution.&rdquo;&nbsp;Whether investors choose to exercise the option remains to be seen. But then, the group never ever kept its investors comfortable.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Governance grouses</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">In May 2014, SES accused the company of not complying with laws pertaining to corporate governance and transparency while acquiring Vadinar Power (VPCL) from Essar Power, another subsidiary of EEHL. &ldquo;&hellip;by setting up a separate company not being a subsidiary of listed company, the promoters are able to keep all aspects of VPCL away from public shareholders scrutiny,&rdquo; the SES report states. &ldquo;Even at the time of consideration for acquiring the entire stake, financials of VPCL are not in public domain. This violates the rules of related party transactions under Section 188 of the Companies Act, 2013,&rdquo; says Gupta.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">He points out that Essar Oil&rsquo;s notice on acquiring VPCL states that the valuation report and fairness option document are available for inspection at the company&rsquo;s registered office. &ldquo;In this age of e-voting, such an archaic option is nothing but an attempt to comply with the law in letter, but not in spirit.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>The tide is turning- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">There&rsquo;s another issue with the VPCL acquisition. Essar Power will use the money earned from selling VPCL to buy preferential shares in group company Essar House. Trouble is, Essar House is a debtor to Essar Oil, since it has to return some Rs 1,900-odd crore of deferred tax money to the latter. &ldquo;The company is bailing out Essar House from its default by converting its current debtors to long-term investment. In one stroke, the company will remove the default situation of its group company at the cost of Essar Oil shareholders,&rdquo; says Gupta.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">SES also raises objections to related-party directors participating in board meetings. While Essar Oil insists that &ldquo;None of the other directors or key managerial personnel of the company either directly or through their relatives are in any way concerned or interested whether financially or otherwise in this resolution&rdquo;, Gupta disagrees. &ldquo;Ravi Ruia is an interested party and the company has not disclosed his interest,&rdquo; he points out.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Street signs- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">This isn&rsquo;t the first time the Ruias have come directly under the scanner for corporate governance issues. In 2012, London-based Pensions Investment Research Consultants (PIRC) warned investors that &ldquo;Director independence and board attendance are issues at [EEHL]&rdquo;. In its July-August 2012 Proxy Voting Review, PIRC criticised Ravi Ruia for holding the post of an independent director, despite having &ldquo;an indirect interest in 76.72% of the company&rdquo; and pointed out that he had not attended two of the five scheduled meetings in 2012. PIRC recommended that shareholders oppose the appointment of Deloitte as EEHL&rsquo;s auditors. It stated that Deloitte&rsquo;s non-audit fee of $2.4 million exceeded the audit fees for the year under review. PIRC&rsquo;s study stated, &ldquo;The level of non-audit fees tendered as a part of the Stanlow [refinery] acquisition creates a potential for conflict of interest on the part of the independent auditor.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Back home, it didn&rsquo;t help that Essar Oil initially deflected all queries regarding the delisting &mdash; indeed, on May 21, the company denied to the stock exchanges that it had received any notice of a bid from the promoters. Barely a month later, on June 22, the board of directors approved the delisting bid, in a meeting that was brought forward by a day &mdash; Essar cities &ldquo;convenience of the directors&rdquo; as the reason. Parikh expresses his scepticism at Essar&rsquo;s claims, pointing to the rising share price. &ldquo;Strong delisting moves have obviously been known to insiders from May 2014 and the [share] price has since moved past Rs 100.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">If that&rsquo;s not enough drama, there&rsquo;s also the role Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has played in the delisting process. LIC acquired a 1.83% stake in Essar Oil in January 2010, purchasing 22.1 million shares worth Rs 309.4 crore through open market transactions at Rs 140 per share. Interestingly, LIC is not mentioned as holding more than 1% of Essar Oil&rsquo;s shares under the terms of the Listing Agreement to the bourses: market analysts believe that is perhaps because the investment has been spread over multiple portfolios.</p>\n<p class="p3">LIC will incur a loss of Rs 70.3 crore if the delisting goes ahead at the current market value. Had LIC invested the same amount in term deposits at 9% in 2010, it would have earned more than Rs 150 crore as interest over a four-year period. What makes the situation even more incongruous is that LIC has a nominee on the board of governors, R Sudarshan. Why would he agree to a delisting price that harms the interests of the company he represents? Despite repeated e-mail requests and a pending RTI request on the issue, LIC declined to comment on its stake in Essar Oil, citing the need to maintain secrecy regarding individual firms for fear of affecting stock prices. On its part, EEHL, too, remained tight-lipped about naming directors who attended the meeting. An e-mail response merely stated that the board meeting &ldquo;had the required quorum&rdquo; and did not answer a question on what were Sudarshan&rsquo;s views on the delisting proposal.</p>\n<p class="p3">Despite all the speculation and controversy, EEHL has decided to go ahead with delisting Essar Oil. For its part, the Essar Oil management feels that the minority investors have not been short-changed and have more than got their dues. In the e-mail response, the company stated, &ldquo;Essar Oil&rsquo;s IPO came in the year 1995, when two types of shares were offered. The pure equity portion was offered at Rs 45 per share. The second was optionally fully convertible debentures, which were converted at an average price of Rs 47.5 per share over a period of time till 1997. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, the share price has more than doubled from Rs 51.65 to Rs 109 as on July 1st.&rdquo; In other words, the writing on the wall is very clear for retail investors: heads I win, tails you lose.&nbsp;</p>', 'Essar Oil''s decision to voluntarily delist from the bourses raises issues of corporate governance and transparency ', '20', '', 0, '', 'a-very-slippery-business-103', 98, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'A very slippery business', 'Essar Oil''s decision to voluntarily delist from the bourses raises issues of corporate governance and transparency ', '', '', '', 'Essar Oil,Lalit Kumar Gupta,Essar Energy Holdings,Ruias,Corporate governance', 0, NULL, '2015-01-16 19:43:58', NULL, '2014-08-08', 0),

There&rsquo;s the years spent lugging heavy drumsets around in the back of his dad&rsquo;s Premier Padmini and there is the decade-long gap when he left his drums &mdash; and Delhi &mdash; behind to build a career in Mumbai. Thankfully, &rsquo;70s bands were not the only ones to mull reunions in recent years, and Tyagi has been killing it on stage for close to seven years now.</p>\n<p class="p3">It all started back in Air Force School, Delhi, where Tyagi and his friends started a band of their own. By the time he joined the Delhi College of Engineering, he had bought his own locally-assembled drumset. That was when White Fang was born, with its name borrowed from a Jack London paperback and with Gautam Ghosh, Amitanshu Das, Tehrunna Dubash and Rahul Ram &mdash; yes, the Indian Ocean bass guitarist &mdash; as bandmates. They played classic rock at college venues and festivals till Tyagi left for IIM-A in 1983.</p>\n<p class="p3">The move didn&rsquo;t hamper his musical pursuits, as Tyagi went on to join Hammersmith, with brothers Philip and Mark Hayden and Cedric Fernandes as bandmates. With a hard rock sound and famed Jimi Hendrix covers, the band tasted national level success and became one of the first Indian bands to be featured on MTV. Post-IIM, there was D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu, this time, with Ram and some others. But between 1992 and 2008 followed an exile when each night he dreamt of getting back on stage.</p>\n<p class="p3">It only took a few calls, then, for the friends to decide to jam again, if only a few times a year. &ldquo;We came together and formed Applied For, carrying forward the name from an older band. We play a lot of soft rock and blues and our audience consists of the same set of friends who heard us while growing up, though a lot more youngsters show up for our sessions as well,&rdquo; laughs Tyagi.</p>\n<p class="p3">Applied For now plays at an annual reunion session for bands called Rerock, held around December each year. The first ever Rerock was held at the Garden of Five Senses in Delhi, and Tyagi has vivid memories of watching his beaming family in the audience, with the band opening the show with Whitesnake&rsquo;s <em>Fool for your loving</em>. These were not the only memorable shows: Tyagi has fond memories of IIT Delhi in the &lsquo;80s, when 10,000-strong crowds would rock it out in the cold Delhi winter with no time restrictions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The craze for music runs in the family now with his son on the verge of starting his own band. At work, too, this reticent professional&rsquo;s on-stage tricks have left juniors in awe. &ldquo;Music helps break down barriers and hierarchies &mdash; on stage, everyone is equal. In a band, like at the workplace, you need to gel and perform as a team. The best bands all have a good time on stage &mdash; and it shows.&rdquo; Does this philosophy help during his shows? &ldquo;At Applied For, we all know our limitations and have no pretensions of being extraordinary. We just want to continue playing as long as we can,&rdquo; Tyagi smiles.&nbsp;</p>', 'Boehringer Ingelheim CMD Sharad Tyagi on what makes a good team — both on and off the stage', '12', '', 0, '', 'for-those-about-to-rock-105', 100, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'For those about to rock', 'Boehringer Ingelheim CMD Sharad Tyagi on what makes a good team — both on and off the stage', '', '', '', 'Boehringer Ingelheim,Sharad Tyagi', 0, NULL, '2015-01-16 19:52:00', NULL, '2014-08-08', 0),

In the piazza, luxury stores for brands such as Just Cavalli, Salvatore Ferragamo, Elie Saab and Stefano Ricci are ringing up the till. International restaurants and cafes have sprung up, among them Japanese specialty Midori and Gordon Ramsay&rsquo;s Maze. The Pearl is Qatar&rsquo;s only freehold residential development with apartments overlooking the Gulf, but these are so expensive that they aren&rsquo;t considered a shrewd investment. Yet, foreigners &mdash; including Indians &mdash; who want a slice of Qatari real estate are lapping these apartments up. That it comes with a lifestyle that combines Dubai&rsquo;s Palm Al-Jumeirah and Europe&rsquo;s Venice is intentional.</p>\n<p class="p3">By day, Doha resembles a desert outpost. Construction dust settles on Aston Martins and Maseratis as they speed over the newly laid city roads. Everywhere, there is evidence of construction: trees are being transplanted, land levelled for grass to come up on the verges and at roadside parks. At night, West Bay glitters like a newly hatched Hong Kong, with lights that flicker playfully across the fa&ccedil;ades of the glass buildings, each one an architectural marvel. Hotels in Lusail &mdash; St Regis, the Ritz Carlton-managed Sharq, the Sheraton, the InterContinental &mdash; resemble the famed strip in Macau in their magnificence. A new road, parts of which will run underwater, is being planned between the newly minted Hamad airport and Lusail.</p>\n<p class="p3">It isn&rsquo;t yet a tourist destination but Qatar is fast shaping up as an alternate to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, with its mix of malls and entertainment facilities geared towards families. The summer heat is searing: the palms are singed and the pavements bake under the sun. But the winter months are ideal weather for everything from sunbathing to mall-hopping. At Souq Waqif, a romantic market has been recreated, complete with cobbled streets, outdoor cafes, fake antique shops, pet stores, carpet centres and street performers &mdash; an Arabian Nights version of Rome&rsquo;s Trastevere, and just as popular.</p>\n<p class="p3">Like Lusail, the Corniche waterfront in the heart of Doha has also been reclaimed from the gulf, a girdle to rival Mumbai&rsquo;s Marine Drive. It too has wide promenades and the Museum of Islamic Art designed by IM Pei claims pride of place. More than the displays, it is the modern architecture that takes your breath away. Built overlooking the waterfront, its collection includes Islamic art works, pottery, carpets, textiles, glazed tiles, jewellery and pages from the Quran from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Spain, Turkey and India. The Museum of Islamic Art can hardly hold a torch to the treasures available in older museums around the world, but the manner in which the exhibits are mounted are a lesson in contemporary museology. Visitors throng its cavernous entrance, with its gift shops and caf&eacute;. Staircases sweep up under a giant light with Islamic motifs suspended from a ceiling.</p>\n<p class="p3">Your driver will point out local attractions &mdash; the Emir&rsquo;s family palaces, the villa built for Princess Diana, the stadium where Rafael Nadal can be spotted playing, the golf club with its lush greens (a sight for sore eyes), and the excitement surrounding FIFA&rsquo;s west Asia debut in Doha in 2022. Local residents say that it isn&rsquo;t as dissolute as Dubai; that Doha is a city with a toehold in the future.</p>\n<p class="p3">Shopping may be an incidental attraction &mdash; Lagoona, Villagio, Centre Point and others pale in comparison with Dubai&rsquo;s signature Dubai Mall &mdash; but dining could turn out to be Doha&rsquo;s unique speciality. The local cuisine borrows heavily from the region and the Mediterranean, but it is the arrival of international brands from Europe and Asia that are setting standards for Japanese, Chinese and Italian restaurants. Clubbing and bars are frowned upon, though there are discotheques. Public drinking is restricted to a few bars at the hotels. Foreigners are not allowed to carry even duty-free liquor from the airport into the city. Expats and visitors are allowed to buy alcohol only from the state-owned Qatar Distribution Centre and not during Ramadan.</p>\n<p class="p3">But Ramadan might be the special season for Doha, with museums and malls closed during the day and staying open till the wee hours. Hotels offer special Ramadan buffets and recreate a spellbinding Arabian setting. Canopied tents, live music, <em>sheesha</em> and <em>hukka</em>, lights shaped like the crescent moon, sofas occupied by large families&hellip; it is a unique and endearing facet of Qatari life.

A sequel to his bestseller <em>Start With Why</em>, Simon Sinek&rsquo;s <em>Leaders Eat Last</em> speaks volumes on the subject of leadership in an unusual way. As the name suggests, leaders should not only put themselves first but also put others before them. Only then can organisations build a rich legacy. Sinek has used an assemblage of leaders and organisations as examples of our times.</p>\n<p class="p3">There are three key issues discussed in this masterpiece: the circle of safety, the happy chemicals and something I would like to call longevity. The common thread that runs through these concepts is empathy. Just like the various layers of atmosphere protect us from the sun&rsquo;s harshness, so should leaders supervise their subordinates and also act as protectors to everyone in the organisation. Sinek writes, &ldquo;&hellip;like the Spartans, we will have to learn that our strength will come not from the sharpness of our spears, but from our willingness to offer others the protection of our shields.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Sinek goes on to talk about what he calls the &lsquo;happy&rsquo; chemicals &mdash; endorphin, dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin &mdash; that are secreted in response to different stimuli. The book mostly revolves around these chemicals and their role in driving leaders&rsquo; thoughts and deeds. He terms endorphins and dopamine as &lsquo;selfish&rsquo; chemicals that help get things done and serotonin and oxytocin as &lsquo;selfless&rsquo; chemicals that strengthen social bonds and foster connection and collaboration. Sinek explains that while both selfless and selfish chemicals are important for our well-being, one should not be favoured at the cost of the other; a perfect balance is crucial.</p>\n<p class="p3">He elaborates that good leadership is like an exercise for the body: its effects are not seen immediately but only over a period of time. CEOs who focus on long-term prosperity and growth are true to their calling, in comparison with those who are in business for short-term gains. Sinek chose Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric, and Jeff Sinegal, former CEO of Costco, as examples. One sought short-term gains, while the other aimed for the long haul. No surprises for guessing which of the two giants sleeps peacefully at night.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">As per Sinek&rsquo;s advice, we need to work patiently towards organisational goals, like a farmer who has planted his crop and is waiting for the produce to flourish. I&rsquo;ll leave you with what I consider one of the best lines in the book: &ldquo;If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.&rdquo; So, are you that leader?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Insights</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Risky business</strong></span></p>\n<p class="p1">In a globally interconnected stock market, international investors are keen on finding out how the country-specific volatility of a market portfolio compares with global volatility risk factors in explaining stock pricing and returns on investment.

Instead, after retiring last year as managing director of Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL), the 59-year-old is busier than ever. He&rsquo;s recently taken over India&rsquo;s second-largest pest control services company and has ambitious plans for it. Of course, this is nothing new for Mahendran. Hicare is the company he created a decade ago as Godrej Hicare, a JV between Godrej Industries and Mahendran Holdings. In 2009, it was acquired by Danish MNC ISS Global for Rs 100 crore. And in January this year, Mahendran joined hands with India Value Fund Advisors (IVFA) to acquire a 100% stake in ISS Hicare, making this the first PE deal in the pest control space in India. &ldquo;Even during the JV with Godrej, I was holding 20% of the company. I always wanted to return to this business. The potential and opportunity is too big to ignore,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">He&rsquo;s already made a start. Now rechristened Hicare Services, the Rs 70-crore company reaches out to over 100,000 residential customers and 10,000 commercial establishments. It has strategically priced itself between the unorganised sector and market leader Pest Control India (PCI), and offers annual and multi-year contracts to retail as well as institutional clients. That will go a long way in helping Hicare get to 70 cities by 2016, from the current 30. Currently, the business operates as a combination of company-owned customer service centres coupled with franchises. &ldquo;We are flexible in our approach. Scaling up will depend on factors such as the markets we want to enter,&rdquo; says Mahendran, who is also looking at clocking growth of at least 20% each year for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">What&rsquo;s driving his optimism is the size of the potential market. While the organised market for pesticide services is about Rs 500 crore and is equally split between the commercial and residential segments, the unorganised part is just as big. And even within the organised space, the limited number of players &mdash; including the Rs 100-crore PCI and the UK-headquartered Rentokil &mdash; will work to Hicare&rsquo;s advantage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;&ldquo;Another growth driver is low penetration, where there are less than 1 million households using pest control services,&rdquo; says Vengat Krishnaraj, VP, MAPE Advisory Group, the advisors to the transaction. &ldquo;In the US, the pest control services business is three times larger than pest control products. In India, pest control is only one-fourth of the overall business.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Certainly, in big cities, there is already growing demand for pest control services as high-rise apartment complexes and proximity in residences means an ever-present danger of pest invasion. Moreover, there is a visible conversion from unorganised to organised players, as concerns over the safety of chemicals used and follow-up services increases.

(111, 12, '', 'Clean-up Act', '<p class="p1">Sandeep Gajakas can&rsquo;t understand why people don&rsquo;t pay more attention to their footwear. &ldquo;You see people wearing branded clothes, well-set hair and clean socks. But so often, their shoes are filthy,&rdquo; he says, shaking his head in disbelief. With over a dozen gleaming pairs in his own collection, you could be excused for thinking this is just another fussy dresser, but for the 37-year-old Gajakas, clean shoes means much more. It&rsquo;s a way of life dating back to his school days and, for the past decade, it has also been a profitable business opportunity. In 1996, an unfortunate episode with the neighbourhood <em>mochi</em> &mdash; who sewed through the air cushion insole in a pair of expensive Reebok DMX running shoes, ruining them beyond repair &mdash; made Gajakas ponder the lack of a quality service that can clean and repair shoes impeccably. And that led to the birth, in 2003, of The Shoe Laundry (TSL).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Now a nine-store international chain, TSL created the organised market for shoe cleaning and repair in India. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t invent the concept that shoes get dirty. I invented the concept of cleaning them properly. All our procedures are methods that I have personally tested,&rdquo; claims Gajakas. The idea that people who spend thousands on a pair of sneakers and several times that on designer heels will be more than willing to fork out a few hundred to keep those shoes looking good has also spawned a number of similar businesses over the past few years. So you have single-store outfits such as Reboot, Paramount and Glow Shoe Laundry in Mumbai, Futstep in Nashik, Tip Top Shoe Laundry in Indore, Klean N Kare and The Shoe Men in Delhi and Revival Shoe Laundry in Patna, among others. Then there are multi-store chains such as Gajakas&rsquo; own TSL, Pressto Zapato and Mr Pronto. And each of these chains is ensuring in its own way that it stays in step with a competitive market.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Squeaky clean</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Perhaps understandably, when Gajakas, a graduate from the National Institute of Fire Engineering, first broached the idea of setting up a shoe repair business, his family wasn&rsquo;t enthusiastic. Qualified professionals themselves, they couldn&rsquo;t understand why an engineer would want to make a career out of cleaning shoes. But Gajakas was determined to see his idea through and spent several months on &ldquo;research&rdquo; &mdash; cleaning dozens of different types of shoes collected from friends and family &mdash; to understand the ways to treat different materials and problems. In June 2003, he distributed flyers around Andheri, the Mumbai suburb where he lives, advertising &ldquo;India&rsquo;s first professional footwear laundry and refurbishing service&rdquo;. The response was immediate &mdash; Gajakas recalls answering more than 50 calls the first day itself &mdash; and positive. He promptly quit his job with a call centre to launch TSL from his workshop &mdash; his bathroom.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;I started this business when spare parts for shoes were not readily available. I would experiment with different materials, often spending thousands on something that wouldn&rsquo;t work. There was a lot of money spent on research,&rdquo; says Gajakas. That wasn&rsquo;t the only expense. While he started the business with a minimum charge of Rs 99, costs were often much higher &mdash; picking up and delivering shoes across the city meant high travel expenses. Apart from an initial Rs 12,000, over the next few years, Gajakas invested a total of #20 lakh, ploughing back his earnings into the business. That has paid back &mdash; from earning Rs 2.5 lakh in the first year, TSL is now a Rs 1.8-crore business.</p>\n<p class="p3">So, just what does TSL do? &ldquo;We do for shoes what garages do for cars,&rdquo; laughs Gajakas. Once customers call the company&rsquo;s helpline, their shoes are picked up, cleaned, repaired and delivered back to them within 48 hours. Cleaning is a 15-step process that involves washing the shoe, soaking it, washing it again and stitching up minor tears, etc. Gajakas has developed what he calls &ldquo;technologies&rdquo; to fix different problems in shoes, from fixing a tear in the net of a sports shoe, to repairing the heel on a stiletto or a chipped strap. &ldquo;People would say, &lsquo;<em>Kuchh toh karo</em> (do something)&rsquo; and that would push me to find solutions,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">While rates have gone up to a minimum Rs 180-200, depending on the workshop&rsquo;s location, Gajakas says each workshop now receives at least 50 pairs a day for repair. And most of that growth is through word of mouth. &ldquo;People who liked my service in Andheri would tell their friends and relatives across the city and soon I began getting customers from all over Mumbai,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With expansion on his mind, from 2009 onwards, Gajakas began standardising all the processes required for his company and looked into spare parts availability outside the city. In 2011, TSL opened its first franchise workshop, not in any Indian city but in Bhutan. Now, TSL has eight franchises under the ShoeVival brand, of which two are outside India, in Bhutan and Kenya. By end-2014, Gajakas aims to add another six. What will help going forward is that TSL has tied up with major footwear brands such as Puma, Nike and Reebok to repair their shoes at its workshops across the country.&nbsp; When customers bring in shoes that are out of warranty or are too damaged for in-store repairs, they are directed to TSL, which repairs them at a slightly discounted rate. Around 10% of the company&rsquo;s customers now come through this route. Every costly shoe that is defective and within the warranty period, if replaced, is a loss to the footwear company, points out Gajakas. &ldquo;When we refurbish it, the brand pays our service but saves on replacing the shoe. If the shoe is out of warranty, the customer pays for the service but is happy that the life of the shoe has been extended.&nbsp;Customers are happy and so is the store.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Odd jobs and rich repairs</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Where Gajakas prides himself on returning customers shoes that gleam like new, Abhishek Dhingra takes pains to emphasise that his business is not a shoe laundry. Rather, Mr Pronto, which has 11 operational stores across Chennai, Bengaluru and Delhi, is a chain of fix-it stores with an emphasis on speedy turnaround. &ldquo;We try to do most of the repairs at the store and return it to the customer immediately. Unlike other similar businesses, our focus is on repair that makes shoes last longer, and not cleaning,&rdquo; says the 38-year-old co-founder, who started Mr Pronto with his father in 2003.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Unlike other businesses, our focus is mainly on repair that lasts longer, not just cleaning" - Abhishek Dhingra, co-founder, Mr Pronto</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The idea for the store, which struck Dhingra when he saw shoe-repair services in the Philippines and Europe during his college days, has now evolved to multiple services, from changing the sole to orthopaedic adjustments for people with foot problems, as well as repairs of bags, luggage and baby strollers. Repair charges range between Rs 30 and Rs 1,000, depending on the work and, on average, each store receives around 25 pairs a day during the week, going up to 40 on weekends.</p>\n<p class="p3">Mr Pronto started its services in Chennai and now has six outlets in the city, three in Bengaluru and one in Delhi; of these, two are franchised operations. The machinery and material is imported from various countries, with over 70 suppliers on the rolls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Dhingra is currently in talks with potential investors and declines to share revenue and investment figures, but points out that all outlets, whether company-owned or franchises, typically break even at the operational level within three months. &ldquo;We are now looking at expanding to a 40-50 store chain in the next three years,&rdquo; he says. The plan is to triple the size of the company and the focus, he adds, will be on North India. Outlets are generally located in malls and high streets, but now he plans to set them up at metro stations as well, with two in Bengaluru in the first phase. Each outlet is manned by two to five workers, depending on how busy the store is. Workers are sent to all stores across India to train under former employees on the different kinds of repair works that Mr Pronto offers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">If TSL is focusing on establishing a pan-India presence for its shoe cleaning service and Mr Pronto is setting up as odd-job man extraordinaire, Pressto Zapato is finding a niche for itself in catering to the big spenders. A more recent entrant in the market, Pressto, a premium laundry service, started its shoe-cleaning wing in 2012, targeting owners of high-end and luxury footwear and leather products. There&rsquo;s a growing tribe of Indians who won&rsquo;t step out in anything less than a pair of Jimmy Choos or Christian Louboutins and need to ensure that their Birkins stay in ship shape. That&rsquo;s where Zapato &mdash; Spanish for shoes &mdash; steps in. &ldquo;It is difficult to categorise our customers into socioeconomic groups, but the bags and shoes we get for repairs are all high-end brand such as Gucci, Chanel and Louis Vuitton,&rdquo; says Esther Lennaerts, executive chairperson, Pressto Zapato.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"All the shoes and bags we get are high-end brands such as Gucci, Chanel and Louis Vuitton" - Esther Lennaerts, executive chairperson, Pressto Zapato</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The chain currently has 23 stores across posh locations in Mumbai and Delhi, with plans to open two more stores by end-2014. &ldquo;We plan on aggressively expanding out of attractive locations that are easily accessible to our customers,&rdquo; says Lennaerts, adding that Zapato has a dedicated customer base of around 2,000 in Mumbai and 1,000 in Delhi who seek it out on a monthly basis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Given the price tags of the luxurious accessories it handles, Zapato&rsquo;s charges, too, are higher than other shoe-cleaning services in the country. Basic cleaning starts at Rs 350 and goes up to several thousand for repair and recolouring. All equipment has been imported from Spain and the Netherlands and Pressto has even brought in experts from Europe to train the seven to nine workers employed at each outlet.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Best foot forward</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">All three chains agree that there&rsquo;s a growing market for their service &mdash; as people spend more on their accessories, they won&rsquo;t be satisfied with the rough-and-ready work a cobbler will do in case any repair work is required. In any case, the neighbourhood <em>mochi</em> is himself part of a vanishing breed of traditional odd-job men, which means the dependence on an organised service is only likely to increase.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">And not surprisingly, the biggest hurdle in this race remains the same that the unorganised industry faces: finding good workers. Cleaning and repairing shoes isn&rsquo;t a job many youngsters want to take up when there are similar-paying jobs in retail and the restaurants business. &ldquo;Not everyone wants to be associated with a business that involves cleaning footwear. Even if we do find people for the job, they eventually succumb to peer pressure and quit,&rdquo; complains Gajakas. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Dhingra also faced similar challenges when he started his business but today, he says the situation has improved slightly. &ldquo;I offer better salaries and take care of their accommodation and the education of their children, so it is easier for me to find technicians. But it is a challenge to attract well-educated people to work for me,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Apart from fighting the reluctance on part of potential employees, it doesn&rsquo;t help that these businesses also have to battle fragmented demand. The bright, shiny side? With towering disposable incomes, India&rsquo;s spendthrift upper middle class has the moolah to fork out good cash &mdash; both for hot shoes and for the hot steam treatment the pairs would need after a night out in the city. This should come as foot-tappin&rsquo; music to Dhingra and co.&rsquo;s ears, for sure. <span class="s2"><br /></span></p>', 'There''s an army of professionals hard at work to bring your tired clogs, sneakers and heels to life.

(112, 16, '', 'All smoke, no fire', '<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s getting to the stage where auto firms may soon pay you to buy cars. That&rsquo;s probably an exaggeration, but consider what&rsquo;s on offer currently: Maruti is giving you Rs 50,000 off on the Swift and Rs 91,500 less on SX4; at Hyundai, it&rsquo;s Rs 35,000 off if you go for the i20 and Rs 32,000 less on the i10; Fiat is offering a Rs 1 lakh exchange bonus on Punto and Linea Classic; and Chevrolet is selling cars on zero down payment and throwing in an extra year&rsquo;s maintenance free.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Even the luxury segment has seen sweet deals, with dealers offering benefits and offers on luxury cars such as Mercedes, Audi and BMW. Not surprisingly, Mercedes and Audi deny the trend. One reason for that could be that no luxury brand would like to be labelled as a &lsquo;discount&rsquo; brand. Eberhard Kern, managing director and CEO, Mercedes-Benz India, says,&ldquo;At Mercedes-Benz, we are focused on sustainable and profitable growth and not on short term discounting strategies,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">But industry watchers strongly maintain that there are discounts in the luxury segment on ground. Kumar Kandaswami, senior director, Deloitte India, points out, &ldquo;I would be an absolute idiot to go and buy a four- to five-month-old car model at list price when there are enough negotiations on special prices and free accessories.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">You don&rsquo;t have to look far for the reasons for this unprecedented rush to offer price-offs and freebies. Last year, the Indian auto market went into reverse gear for the first time in a decade. Overall volumes fell from close to 2.7 million vehicles sold in FY13 to just 2.5 million in FY14. If that&rsquo;s not worrying enough, there was a decline in demand for small cars &mdash; which make up 55% of passenger vehicle sales &mdash; in a country where car still means small car. According to data from industry body SIAM, India&rsquo;s staple mini passenger vehicles saw a drop in sales in FY14, from 570,023 units in FY13 to 568,234. That may not sound like much, but this is the first time ever that the sub-segment has seen a drop. And the latest available figures, for April 2014, prove that the disturbing trend is continuing &mdash; mini passenger vehicles clocked sales of 35,271, down from 47,800 sold in the same month last year. &ldquo;The industry, unfortunately, is passing through one of its toughest phases. It posted a drop of over 11% (in April) despite excise duty benefits being duly passed on to customers. So, to bring back buoyancy, all OEMs may end up offering discounts to buyers. They help drive customer traffic and increase enquiry levels,&rdquo; says Maruti Suzuki&rsquo;s official spokesperson.</p>\n<p class="p2">Little wonder, then, that carmakers are turning to discounts and offers to rev up an indifferent market. Vinay Piparsania, executive director, marketing, sales and service, Ford India, explains the rationale. &ldquo;Marketing offers play a key role during challenging times in rewarding loyal customers and addressing pent-up demand. Such offers provide customers a reason to advance their purchases.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">But there&rsquo;s also a more pressing reason. &ldquo;Whenever discounting comes into the market, it has more to do with the inventory carried by dealers,&rdquo; feels Siddharth Jain, senior consultant in the automotive and transportation practice, Frost &amp; Sullivan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">When volumes come down, the entire chain &mdash; from OEM to suppliers, to dealers &mdash; comes under pressure, and discounting is resorted to. Typically, the monthly interest cost on inventory is around 1% of turnover. With an average overall margin of around 3%, inventory, when unsold for long, starts eating into profits. &ldquo;I would expect inventory in the market upwards of 50 days or so. You have to get rid of a product like this fairly early, otherwise it impacts everyone. Volumes have come down, except for some successful brands that have aggregated all the volumes,&rdquo; echoes Deloitte&rsquo;s Kandaswami.</p>\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;Another contributory factor for customers&rsquo; cold feet on buying cars has been the high cost of ownership. &ldquo;It went up by 30% in the past three years, in conjunction with rising fuel prices, high interest rates and high inflation,&rdquo; says Ajay Srinivasan, head, industry research, Crisil.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Limited gains</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">So far, there don&rsquo;t seem to be enough takers for the discount offers. Despite the excise duty cut announced in February, the market hasn&rsquo;t picked up this year. At Hyundai, for instance, older models such as Santro and Eon still face a weak market. In April 2014, it sold just 9,124 units of the two models compared with 11,328 the previous month and 12,614 in the year-ago period. &ldquo;The discounts on entry-level cars work more for customers in tier 2 and 3 cities, who are price conscious. Once we have a stable government and the monsoon performs, sales will improve,&rdquo; says Rakesh Srivastava, senior VP (sales and marketing), Hyundai Motors India. Besides, he points out, the discount strategy is working very well in rural India. &ldquo;In 2004, our share in rural India was 4%. In 2010, it was 11% and in 2014, it is 20%.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p2">The discount strategy doesn&rsquo;t seem to be getting the desired results for the country&rsquo;s largest car-maker either. Maruti&rsquo;s entry-level cars (Maruti 800, A-star, Alto and WagonR) showed no signs of improving sales (26,043 units in April, compared with 40,085 in March 2014 and 34,927 a year ago). According to news reports, sales of its bestselling model, Swift, too, fell for the first time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>When it rains- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">A Maruti spokesperson, though, disagrees with this analysis. &ldquo;Monthly sales reported by media are wholesale numbers (what we sell to dealers) and hence do not reflect the real ground situation. We have seen some growth in retail. But this is not due to discounts alone. Several aspects, such as customer engagement initiatives including test drives, focused on exchange, have helped us strengthen retail.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">But how does Maruti defend falling sales of the Swift? &ldquo;Wholesale figures for a month or two months do not convey the right picture. They could be the result of stock correction. Similarly, retails for a month or two do not give the correct picture. But, for the record, retail sales for Swift have grown in April,&rdquo; says the spokesperson.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>Changing preferences</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">While poor consumer sentiment could be one part of the story, the other aspect is that consumers are increasingly becoming choosy. Most agree that market leader Maruti failed to introduce enough new models over the past year and there was model fatigue for the rest of its portfolio. &ldquo;Ford Ecosport customers never existed but the company created a new category: a low-cost SUV segment. Customers are typically migrating from the sedan segment,&rdquo; feels Jain. Hyundai&rsquo;s Xcent and Honda&rsquo;s Amaze have pulled in many buyers as well. In sum, there has been no expansion or new customer addition in the car market: existing customers have migrated from older models to more exciting propositions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">So, ironically, some OEMs are offering discounts on most of their portfolio even as there is a long waiting period on a few models. Maruti Celerio, for instance, has a waiting period and no discount. At Ford, you will have to wait two to three months for a Figo, but the moment you ask for Ford Fiesta Classic, there will be a discount.</p>\n<p class="p2">Kandaswami believes discounts are here to stay. &ldquo;You discount in a period when it has the highest impact, when the product hasn&rsquo;t been completely overtaken by competitors but you&rsquo;re not able to command a waiting list,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Most companies and experts feel that now that a stable government is in place, it will still take six to seven months before the buying sentiment improves and growth is back on track. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that people don&rsquo;t have money but that they&rsquo;d been postponing purchase,&rdquo; feels Srivastava. Till then, the car-makers will have to keep handing out lures in the hope that customers finally take the bait.&nbsp;</p>', 'Domestic car-makers continue with aggressive discounts to prop up flagging sales, but that may not necessarily fetch them the numbers they desire', '9', '', 0, '', 'all-smoke-no-fire-112', 107, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'All smoke, no fire', 'Domestic car-makers continue with aggressive discounts to prop up flagging sales, but that may not necessarily fetch them the numbers they desire', '', '', '', 'Car discounts,Mercedes-Benz,Maruti Suzuki,Ford India,Hyundai', 0, NULL, '2015-01-17 14:47:28', '2015-01-17 14:59:44', '2014-07-05', 0),

(114, 20, '', 'Primary Concern', '<p class="p1">The Modi mania pervading the markets is yet to make its way to the corner of the Street that deals with new floats. The Sensex has scaled 6,500 points since last September and 3,500 points since late February to touch 25,228 as on June 10, but the initial public offering (IPO) market continues to remain sluggish. The trend has continued from 2013, which saw only three companies raising Rs 1,283 crore, compared with Rs 6,768 crore raised in 2012. IPOs worth Rs 60,000 crore &mdash; including GMR Energy&rsquo;s Rs 1,450-crore issue &mdash; have been withdrawn over the last couple of years amid fears of low investor confidence. A look at the Sebi website shows no new draft red herring prospectuses have been filed since April 2014.</p>\n<p class="p3">However, there is mounting optimism on the Street that the sentiment will change soon, in anticipation of economic reforms by the BJP government. Prime Database founder Prithvi Haldea says, &ldquo;Secondary markets always lead economic recovery as stocks are traded based on future expectations. Assuming the economy shows signs of an upturn and secondary markets don&rsquo;t behave erratically, IPOs will take off because the appetite among investors is huge. I expect a steady stream of IPOs in three to four months.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>The burning issue - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">While observers believe infrastructure, real estate and power companies will experience difficulty in raising money, e-commerce, consumer goods and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are expected to hit the IPO market. Haldea also expects a bunch of public sector units to be divested in the coming months.</p>\n<p class="p3">However, follow-on public offers or IPOs won&rsquo;t be the only route companies will take. Listed companies are raising money through optionally fully convertible debentures or the qualified institutional placement (QIP) route. Close to Rs 15,180 crore has been raised through various equity instruments in FY14 already, compared with Rs 26,260 crore in FY13. Several large-cap QIP issues are in the pipeline such as Larsen &amp; Toubro and Reliance Communications.</p>\n<p class="p3">Sebi has introduced several measures to attract hesitant retail investors to IPOs, including an e-IPO mechanism whereby an investor can apply online. But Sebi&rsquo;s attempts to woo retail investors might not work, considering that many continue to lose money in new listings. Nearly 51 issues that have hit the market since FY11 are trading at discounts to their issue prices, while only 32 issues are trading at a premium of over 50%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s a telling commentary on the exorbitant pricing of some offerings relative to their fundamentals. In fact, the biggest float of 2014, steel company Loha Ispat, managed to garner only 20% of its total offer of Rs 214 crore, while Wonderla Holidays was subscribed a whopping 38.06 times its offer value of Rs 181 crore, riding on leveraged HNI investments. &ldquo;Buyers are waiting for the right price, right company and right environment before investing,&rdquo; says Haldea.&nbsp;</p>', 'The IPO market is untouched by the unbridled enthusiasm on Main Street.

(115, 20, '', 'Which way ahead?', '<p class="p1">Nitin Jairam Gadkari &mdash; whose personal website describes him as a visionary performer &ndash; is taking a novel approach to address the country&rsquo;s growing unemployment issue. He&rsquo;s getting the jobless to plant 2 billion trees along the country&rsquo;s 100,000 km of national highway network. To be administered under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, the Cabinet minister who straddles a number of portfolios &mdash; national highways, road transport and shipping and also additional charge of the rural development ministry &mdash; is confident of tackling two vexed issues with one stone: creating jobs and protecting the environment. While the jury is still out on this out-of-the-box solution, the Street is already blushing green with one particular stock, the Virendra Mhaiskar-owned IRB Infrastructure Developers, a prominent road construction company. While the company has nothing to do with Gadkari&rsquo;s initiative, it has a lot to with the roads minister in power.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Though IRB has been a sector favourite on the Street, the stock came under heavy weather in 2012 when media reports alleged that the company was given the marquee Mumbai-Pune Expressway contract, and other hefty deals, when Nitin Gadkari was Maharashtra&rsquo;s PWD minister in the Shiv Sena-BJP government between 1995 and 1999. It was further alleged that the group had bought shares worth Rs 1.85 crore in Gadkari&rsquo;s Purti Sakhar Karkhana in 2001, and gave a loan of Rs 165 crore to his company Purti Power &amp; Sugar in 2010. The allegation was further compounded by governance issues when Goldman Sachs accused IRB of not adequately disclosing its November 2010 acquisition of a Rs 107-crore aircraft.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Skidding through- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The big blow came when Mhaiskar was investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation in May 2012 for his possible involvement in the murder of RTI activist Satish Shetty in Maharashtra. Shetty had accused IRB Infrastructure and its subsidiary Aryan Infrastructure Investment of land-grabbing by forging documents and manipulating land records. Since then the stock continued to trend downward, sliding from its high of Rs 154 in October 2012 to around Rs 54 in October 2013. However, the rally on the broader market that began towards the end of 2013 saw the stock surge 72% to end the year at Rs 93. With general elections looming closer and the markets sensing a BJP victory at the hustings, the stock continued its rally. The news of the company winning two contracts added to the feel-good factor since February-end. And as the opinion polls indicated a clear verdict for the BJP, the stock just took off. The subsequent arrival of Modi and his team, including Gadkari, saw the stock dishing out a mind-boggling 143% return at Rs 192 (June 13) against the benchmark Sensex gaining 19% to 25,228.</p>\n<p class="p3">Though analysts believe the company has the momentum going for itself with Gadkari in power, only a few admit it candidly. While Daljeet S Kohli of IndiaNivesh Securities feels close ties with Gadkari will help the company consolidate itself in the road building sector, Bharanidhar Vijayakumar from Spark Capital feels &ldquo;sentiments&rdquo; will improve. Is that indeed the case?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>The road less travelled</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">To begin with, the flurry with which the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), a nodal agency of the transport and highways ministry, handed out contracts to road players has come down to a trickle. Between 2010 and 2012, road developers fell over each other to grab projects expecting high traffic and chose to bid at high premiums, resulting in a record 147 road projects worth Rs 1.47 lakh crore being bid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The big leap in project awards was also because they were being let out to developers without land and other requisite approvals being in place. Also, the subsequent slowdown and capital squeeze saw developers, big and small, either giving up projects or failing to tie up the required funds. Not surprisingly, after awarding tenders for 6,800 km in FY12, the numbers fell to 1,128 km in FY13 and 1,646 km in FY14, mostly on engineering procurement and construction (EPC) mode as there were no takers for public private partnership (PPP) projects. In EPC mode, the government funds the project and the private developer just builds the road, while under PPP mode, the developer builds the road and makes his money through collection of toll or annuity. Over the past few years, road developers have been staying away from road projects after bidding aggressively.</p>\n<p class="p3">Amidst a challenging environment, IRB has managed to grow its sales and profits at a CAGR of 20.78% and 3.32% to Rs 3,732 crore and Rs 460 crore, respectively, over FY10-FY14.&nbsp;The reason, according to Mhaiskar, as mentioned in a Q3FY14 concall with analysts, is that the company has remained sector focused. &ldquo;We have built on our abilities by sharpening our construction acumen, sharpening the tolling mechanisms, by bidding in a sensible manner, churning the portfolio and making it operational in a time-bound manner.&rdquo; Today IRB is one of the largest BOT toll operators with 21 projects covering 9,295 lane km, of which 5,489 lane km is operational, including the marquee Mumbai-Pune Expressway.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We have built on our abilities by sharpening our construction acumen and tolling mechanisms" - Virendra Mhaiskar, chairman, IRB</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">More importantly, IRB&rsquo;s gross toll collection has shown 20% CAGR to Rs 4.6 crore/day over FY11-14. In FY14, despite moderate traffic growth, toll revenue increased by around 13%, led by an increase in toll rates as per contracts and start of toll collection on new projects. &ldquo;I would like to take you back to a few years, when we used to just do toll auctions, and that habit of bidding out on an auction where we were committing for a fixed amount to be paid to the government had necessarily sharpened our abilities to evaluate the revenue forecasting, and that is very, very primary in understanding a BOT project,&rdquo; explained Mhaiskar in the concall.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Pull factor- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">NHAI has set a target of tendering out projects totalling 6,000 km worth Rs 55,000 crore in the current year and is looking at a new government to fast track the award of projects. Since the new fiscal began, IRB has bagged three new projects aggregating around Rs 6,000 crore (Solapur-Yedeshi: Rs 1,317 crore; Yedeshi-Aurangabad: Rs 2,754 crore; and Kaithal-Rajasthan: Rs 2,035 crore). As a result, the current order-book, too, has surged to Rs &nbsp;11,974 crore, over three times FY14 revenues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">So it is not surprising that an overwhelming number of analysts are bullish on the stock &mdash; the Reuters Consensus estimates show 24 out of 29 analysts have either a buy or an outperformer rating on the stock. Even so, the road ahead for IRB is far from smooth.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Taking a toll</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">While the company&rsquo;s order-book seems impressive, what also needs to be taken into cognizance is that the company has been levered quite a bit. From a debt-equity ratio of 1.43 times in FY10, as on date the number stands at 2.89 times, with over Rs 10,000 crore debt on its books. Besides, its return ratios too are wilting.</p>\n<p class="p3">From a high of 21% in FY10, the return on equity has come down to 18%. Going ahead, higher interest and depreciation on account of the Ahmedabad project, the biggest in IRB&rsquo;s portfolio, commencing operations in FY16, also means the return ratios would taper down further. IRB will also need to infuse equity of Rs 2,900 crore over the next three years (Rs 1,250 crore in FY 15; Rs 950 in FY16 crore; and Rs 700 crore in FY17). However, Mhaiskar is not too perturbed. &ldquo;We would not like the debt-equity gearing to go beyond 3:1. And as regards cash generation, at the consolidated level, close to Rs 900-950 crore is being generated annually, and that continuing for the next three years with the order-book visibility, equity investment should not be a problem at all. Some more incremental projects can certainly be looked at,&rdquo; he mentions in the concall.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>What''s in the bag- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The other area of concern is the risk of increasing political interference. Given that 41% of IRB&rsquo;s projects are concentrated in Maharashtra, which is due for assembly elections this year, the company&rsquo;s toll road projects have been facing some rough weather following public opposition to paying toll charges. In fear of losing the election, the Congress-NCP led combine in Maharashtra shut down 44 toll posts on June 9. Of these booths, 34 belonged to the public works department and 10 to the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation. IRB has 11 BOT projects operating in Maharashtra, of which six are PWD projects. The closure has impacted four of these toll posts. This is one reason the stock slipped 12.5% in four sessions, from Rs 219.35 to Rs 191.75 on June 13, 2014. Kohli of IndiaNivesh Securities, though, expects the storm to blow over. &ldquo;Markets are driven by sentiments. When investors realise that only 3% of IRB&rsquo;s revenue is being affected by the government&rsquo;s move, the outlook will change.&rdquo; In contrast, Vijayakumar of Spark feels companies such as IRB, which thrive on the BOT model, might be adversely affected if such a precedent is set.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Interestingly, institutional holding in the stock has increased from around 6% in June 2012 to 13% since the controversy broke out. The big investor in the stock is the Singapore-based fund manager, Sanjiv Duggal of HSBC, who has increased his stake cumulatively across two funds from 2.33% to over 6% as on March 2014.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While there is no denying that IRB is the best play in the roads sector, the recent outperformance of the stock leaves hardly any room for appreciation in the near term. Bank of America Merill Lynch has downgraded the stock to neutral with a price target of Rs 180 level, since it lacks near-term triggers. Kotak, too, has downgraded the stock with a revised target of Rs 180. Considering that economic revival on the ground is still to take place, what with commercial vehicles and passenger vehicle sales continuing to trend down, the road ahead for IRB is a long and winding one.

(116, 20, '', 'Agenda: Innovation', '<p class="p1">For decades, artisans in Moradabad&rsquo;s brass products cluster have breathed air laced with pollutants and toxic gases. Working mostly out of their backyards with traditional open melting furnaces that spew zinc vapours and other flue gases into the air, the cluster&rsquo;s inhabitants are prey to asthma and tuberculosis. In mid-2012, three research scientists from the National Metallurgical Laboratory (NML) in Jamshedpur dropped in to observe their working methods. Visits from scientists and NGOs are fairly routine but this was the first time a CSIR (Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research) network lab was getting involved. &ldquo;We found that most of the artisans were reluctant to give up methods that previous generations had been using,&rdquo; says KL Sahoo, principal scientist, CSIR-NML. Back in Jamshedpur, they came up with a few concepts based on improved technologies developed in-house and invited some of the artisans over to take a look. &ldquo;They rejected our designs right away,&rdquo; says Sahoo. &ldquo;We had designed a standing furnace, while they were used to sitting and working.&rdquo; It was clear that the new furnace would have to be a modification of the widely-used existing one.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">A year later, when NML delivered the upgraded furnace prototype, Moradabad&rsquo;s artisans approved. With a closed top, the new furnace delivers a 70% drop in air pollution, 20% savings on coke consumption and 30% higher productivity by reducing the time cycle of each batch from 12 minutes to under eight. All this means a near doubling of average daily income, from Rs 700 to Rs 1,320, Sahoo estimates. While the new furnace comes for Rs 7,300 (Rs 14,500 with a training module), upgrading an older one costs only Rs 2,500. The project has also resulted in work being done for the development of cyanide-free electroplating and a simpler and more cost-effective lacquer.</p>\n<p class="p3">The new furnace technology was transferred to the Moradabad Industrial Development Corporation (Midco) in June 2013. But the additional cost and loss of work for a few days due to installation mean none of the 180,000 artisans in the cluster has switched to the new design. Gaurav Ohri, head of the Moradabad Cluster Inclusive Development Society (MCIDS), the nodal body for this exercise, says Midco is trying to arrange for direct government subsidies to them to upgrade their furnaces.</p>\n<p class="p3">Moradabad&rsquo;s brass cluster was one of seven industrial and artisanal clusters handpicked by the National Innovation Council (NInC) for a unique experiment &mdash; the innovation clusters programme &mdash; as part of the Decade of Innovation (2010-2020) project announced by UPA II prime minister Manmohan Singh. Instead of the usual grants and schemes announced regularly for MSMEs, the programme sought to tap into the existing pool of knowledge within the clusters and connect them to available experts within academia and research institutions. The objective &mdash; get some of India&rsquo;s brightest minds to work on the challenges of India&rsquo;s MSME units. &ldquo;Thousands of scientists working for the Indian government have never visited a cluster,&rdquo; says Satyanarayan Gangaram (Sam) Pitroda, former advisor to the PM on public information, infrastructure and innovation and former chairman, NInC. In the process, this programme also sought to stoke innovative thinking on regular business problems.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;&ldquo;We said, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s not worry about big companies&rsquo;. The small guys have no access to universities and research labs,&rdquo; says Pitroda. &ldquo;Over a period of time we had created an ecosystem [for MSMEs]. But we needed to provide more training, VC funding and mentoring. Clusters became an important piece of this puzzle.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We had created an ecosystem for MSMEs but needed to provide training, funding and mentoring" - Sam Pitroda, former chairman, National Innovation Council</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Out of the 7,000-odd industrial and artisanal clusters in India, a shortlist of 30 or 40 was arrived at and from this, seven were chosen to represent a variety of sectors and geographical spread.&nbsp;Launched in November 2011, the innovation clusters project has been unique in many ways. &ldquo;We are the first country in the world to adopt innovation as an agenda,&rdquo; says Pitroda, but admits that seeding the idea was a challenge. &ldquo;It took us quite some time to convince the PM to set up the National Innovation Council.&rdquo; The programme has spent Rs 1.2 crore over its three-year period of pilots.</p>\n<p class="p3">Making connections with the government and getting buy-in from small business units called for a massive effort. &ldquo;We were in touch with various ministries &mdash; MSME, food processing, heavy industries, etc. I was on an Air India flight almost every day for the first year of activity,&rdquo; says Keerthi Laal Kala, the project lead on this initiative. The idea was to create linkages and not go the way of previous programmes that were mainly funding-oriented. &ldquo;Sam told us we&rsquo;re not creating a grant programme,&rdquo; he adds. However, there was provision for funding assistance if needed. &ldquo;We had set a limit of Rs 20 lakh per cluster if we needed to invest in a project.&rdquo; Still, in a couple of instances, the budget did exceed the limit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Also, in many cases, the message didn&rsquo;t get through easily. &ldquo;In Moradabad, it took us 18 months to form an association. There were 13-14 entities working in the area on various cluster development programmes. We asked them to come together under one umbrella &mdash; the MCIDS. Now it has nine of those associations working together,&rdquo; says Kala. Ohri agrees. &ldquo;It took us time to understand the concept,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Moradabad isn&rsquo;t an organised cluster. It has a number of micro units working from home. Everyone has a different level of education, skill and expectations.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Crafting change</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">New products and smarter processes have emerged from the exercise. For instance, in the Ernakulam furniture cluster, around Rs 2.5-3 crore worth of orders have come in during FY14 for products that came out of the design interventions. &ldquo;By 2017, we expect to create business worth Rs 1,000 crore per annum for Kerala&rsquo;s furniture manufacturers through modern design,&rdquo; says KP Raveendran, managing director, Kerala Furniture Consortium (Kefcon), the nodal body in Ernakulam. To begin with, the Ernakulam project was centred on the core challenge of improving the design capabilities of furniture makers in the region. Faced with competition from imports with more contemporary designs and modularity, the units needed to move beyond traditional designs and material. The National Institute of Design (NID) was already working as the nodal agency for implementing the MSME department&rsquo;s Design Clinic scheme in industrial clusters and was roped in to bring in the design inputs. Raveendran says an in-principle agreement has been reached in the last fortnight to set up a furniture hub for the cluster with Rs 45 crore from the Centre, Rs 25 crore from the state and the land cost being borne by the units. &ldquo;It will take two years for the centre to come up,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"By 2017, we expect to create business worth Rs1,000 crore per annum for Kerala''s furniture makers" - KP Raveendran, MD, Kerala Furniture Consortium</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Manu T, an Ernakulam-based industrial design consultant who worked on the final designs that were handed over to Kefcon, says once the importance of the designs was explained, they were ready to move ahead. Of Kefcon&rsquo;s 33 members, only five were hands-on with the project. Manu submitted nine furniture concepts &mdash; living room, bedroom and dining sets &mdash; that were prototyped in the cluster after much delay and teething issues in April. These have been put on display across Ernakulam&rsquo;s furniture distributor showrooms and are being evaluated by its members.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>The fruits of innovation</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The Krishnagiri mango cluster in Tamil Nadu was perhaps the most effective in terms of demonstrable economic value. A naturally formed cluster employing over 250,000 people as direct and indirect labour (during mango harvest season) and spread over 40,100 hectare, it is the largest mango processing region in the state, with 340,000 mt production annually. Sathyamurthy HM, project head for the initiative, says business for the 73 units in India&rsquo;s largest mango pulp producing cluster was always good. &ldquo;But in the last four or five years, growth has been negative. Competition has increased and cost of production has gone up,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We needed to reduce cost of production and increase output through mechanisation. Waste had to be utilised and units realised they should make more value-added products from pulp.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Under NInC, the Krishmaa Cluster Development Society (KCDS) was formed in October 2011. Each year, during the May-July mango season, Krishnagiri&rsquo;s units process 400,000 tonne of fruit, churning out nearly 1.2 million cans of pulp annually. A single unit processes 3,500-4,000 tonne of mango on average. Of this, 50-60% is pulp and the rest is solid waste (skin, fibre and kernel). In the process, 150,000-160,000 cubic metre of liquid waste and 60,000 tonne of dry waste was generated and dumped in the area.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The National Institute of Interdisciplinary Science &amp; Technology (NIIST), Thiruvananthapuram, under the CSIR, suggested using the solid waste to produce fuel briquettes and make mango kernel butter, which finds application in skin and hair products. &ldquo;Briquetting is not a new technology but no one had tried doing it from mango waste,&rdquo; says Sathyamurthy. A single plant could save an estimated Rs 44,000 per day by replacing firewood with briquettes and selling them for a profit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">A model plant was set up in one of the units to demonstrate its viability and profitability. The unit has a production capacity of 1 tonne per hour of briquettes, and needs an investment of Rs 50 lakh. Expensive, but &ldquo;You get back your money within one year,&rdquo; says Sathyamurthy. &ldquo;The other option is to spend Rs 10 lakh to carry and dump it somewhere.&rdquo; KCDS also replicated the idea of generating biogas from liquid waste after visiting the sago (tapioca) cluster in nearby Salem. Around 800 cubic metre of biogas could be produced from 100 cubic metre of liquid waste. &ldquo;The income from secondary products will be more than that from the primary product &mdash; mango.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Waste management aside, the Krishmaa team also turned its attention to preserving mangoes while shipping over long distances, a common problem in the business. A new treatment was devised, the result of a Rs 9-lakh project that included buying mangoes from the participating farmers at market rates and cost of shipment. Of this, 80% was borne by NInC and 20% by KCDS. However, the first lot of fruit with the new treatment didn&rsquo;t quite make it in good shape to the UK &mdash; over 90% of the product was damaged. &ldquo;There were issues with how the protocol was being executed. There was nobody to check how the spraying was being done, for instance. We believe instructions were not followed,&rdquo; defends Kala.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Natural solutions</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">A year-and-a-half into the programme, with 20-odd initiatives running simultaneously with a complex maze of partners, the NInC team decided to rope in a partner to keep track of the on-the-ground operations. Finally, IL&amp;FS agreed to assign six of its staff to these clusters under its own Cluster Development Initiatives (CDI) programme. The integration and execution speed increased and results began to trickle in faster.</p>\n<p class="p3">Among these was Agartala&rsquo;s incense cluster, which mostly has women workers getting Rs 70-100 per day for making sticks for traders and manufacturers. The Tripura Bamboo Mission (TBM) and IL&amp;FS introduced community ownership models with training, procurement and marketing inputs and connected the workers to buyer networks. Of a total revenue of Rs 124 crore last year, TBM generated Rs 86 crore revenue from the incense stick business alone, says director Pravin Agrawal. But the cluster, which contributes nearly 70% of <em>agarbatti</em> production in the country, has had its share of problems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Foremost was the dwindling supply of <em>jigat</em>, a natural adhesive that binds the charcoal and other ingredients in an <em>agarbatti</em> and doesn&rsquo;t react with the perfumes and chemicals used. There has been no commercially sound substitute found for it and <em>agarbatti</em> makers often depend on Vietnam and Cambodia for supplies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">CSIR&rsquo;s Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (Cimap) took 11 months to come up with a bio-replacement formulation that involves cultivating a plant in Tripura that can reduce dependence on <em>jigat</em>. &ldquo;Being an informal sector business, there has been no process standardisation for <em>agarbatti</em> making. We are asking Cimap to help us adopt the new formulation and teach us how to mix it,&rdquo; says Kedar Panda, senior manager, TBM. NInC has asked the Tripura government for 10 acre of land to begin the pilot for growing the plant in local soil and weather conditions and testing its efficacy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The NInC programme also roped in the National Institute of Technology (NIT) in Agartala, where students took up projects on developing low-cost hand-operated machines for mechanising the slicing and polishing of <em>agarbatti</em> bamboo sticks. Four models have emerged from this and the prototypes are being tested. TBM has also signed an MoU with NIT Agartala for making machines that can directly produce <em>agarbatti</em> sticks from bamboo cylinders, as well as a polishing machine to remove fibres from the sticks. A lighter premix is also being tested to increase revenue by producing more sticks per kg. This could generate an additional 5-10% profit for the cluster. While NInC invested Rs 26 lakh during the pilot, the next round is being funded by various international agencies working on livelihood generation projects in the state.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>No takers</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Roping in the knowledge and expertise of local industry bodies was a smart move. Nudging them towards research institutions was the only logical step. At Faridabad&rsquo;s industrial cluster, which houses over 20,000 units, much of the action was already underway by IamSMEofIndia, an SPV formed by the Faridabad Small Industries Association (FSIA) in 2008 to assist MSMEs across India. The new programme brought in a new kind of thinking, says Rajive Chawla, chairman IamSMEofIndia and president of FSIA: &ldquo;NInC made us adolescents from children; it has brought us to a sustainable level.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"The National Innovation Council brought [small and medium enterprises] to a sustainable level" - Rajive Chawla, chairman, IamSMEofIndia</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Chawla&rsquo;s own unit, Jairaj Ancillaries, is a showcase for some of the innovations that emerged out of this programme. Among them is the development of a low-cost auto-loader that works with centre-less grinders &mdash; machines that polish and reduce the diameter of steel rods used in shock absorbers. This machine improves upon a fundamental job: feeding the rods into the grinder. The machine cost Rs 70,000 to prototype but could be sold for Rs 50,000 or less if commercialised, says Chawla, and save on the cost of one worker doing the job. In the open market, it could cost as much as Rs 2 lakh. The prototype is being used in Chawla&rsquo;s own unit but there has been little interest by others in adopting this. &ldquo;Most of the cluster members are reluctant to share their problems and don&rsquo;t want us to come to their factories,&rdquo; says Umesh Gulati, owner of Yuva Engineers and a core member of the project.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Among the other innovations that came up during this programme were the use of idle spinning of the flywheel in a power press machine to power other gadgets, such as the factory&rsquo;s power inverter, and a crack-detecting machine made at Rs 1.5 lakh versus the Rs 20-lakh versions available in the open market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;With the programme, we started to think about innovation. Earlier, we used to think that it is something only large companies do and our job is only to make products for them,&rdquo; says Rahat Bhatia, director, Raga Engineers. &ldquo;Innovation was a one-off thing before this programme.&rdquo; Bhatia has filed for a patent on a new cooling system for die casting moulds and pins that he developed using compressed air, which is readily available on a factory shopfloor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The Faridabad cluster introduced a new term to NInC&rsquo;s workbook &mdash; Tod-Phod-Jod centres, essentially an industry-academia interface offering immersive and real-life learning experiences. The idea was to bring together students and faculty from engineering colleges as well as cluster members as experts to discover innovative and low-cost approaches to problem-solving. Tod-Phod-Jod (TPJ) refers to the process of dismantling and reconstructing a machine to gain practical knowledge on its workings. The NInC programme connected cluster members to nearby Manav Rachna University so that its students could work on live issues faced by the cluster and be more industry ready. The challenges were discussed with professors and students at Manav Rachna but were transferred to the Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CMERI) since the cost was working out to be high, says Chawla. The philosophy behind TPJ has now been extended to a centre operated by Germany&rsquo;s Steinbeis Foundation, which connects MSMEs globally to its own research team and university professors to solve their problems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;A new prescription</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The programme ventures into some untested areas too. For instance, the ayurveda cluster in Kerala was chosen to address a long-standing need to provide a wider market access to ayurvedic medicines. Another CDI of IL&amp;FS, the Confederation of Ayurvedic Renaissance Keralam (Care Keralam) was established by the Kerala State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (Kinfra) with 38% equity participation and the government&rsquo;s Department of Ayush with seed funding of Rs 10 crore and is a cluster of 160 companies engaged in manufacture of ayurvedic medicines. Spread over a 10-acre campus at Koratty&rsquo;s Kinfra Park in Thrissur district, Care Keralam&rsquo;s mandate is to scientifically validate the process and formulation of ayurvedic medicines and make them ready for export markets globally. NInC and CSIR offered to help.</p>\n<p class="p3">Joy Verghese beams with joy as he recites some of the unique benefits that <em>Nishaakathakaadhi</em> <em>kashayam</em> (NKK) delivers to early-stage patients of diabetes mellitus. &ldquo;This drug will not make the patient hypoglycaemic while giving the same effect as glibenclamide [an anti-diabetic sulfa drug],&rdquo; declares the executive director of Care Keralam, a former practising ayurvedic doctor himself. The ayurvedic drug, made from eight naturally found ingredients, has been in existence for decades among Kerala&rsquo;s ayurveda community and has proven to be effective in the treatment of diabetes without the side effects associated with allopathy. Yet, it hasn&rsquo;t achieved the success it could have. Exporting it hasn&rsquo;t been possible because its performance and effects haven&rsquo;t been medically documented as per scientific norms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Bhagyanath Menon, CEO, Care Keralam, says there are 750 SMEs engaged in ayurvedic formulations in Kerala. Most of them are run by practising ayurveda doctors, who started small firms to cater to their patients. Over 25% of the units make this formulation. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been no process validation so far and sales of NKK have been only in the domestic market, confined mainly to the state,&rdquo; adds Verghese. The challenge has been to document it. The Drug Master File that was produced as a result of the innovation clusters programme contains detailed information about the formulation, method of production, quality assessment parameters, toxicity and animal efficacy study (on rodents). These help conform to drug licensing and other regulatory standards required for approvals in overseas markets. Importantly, it unlocks the estimated $70-billion herbal medicines market for Kerala&rsquo;s ayurvedic drug makers. Menon points out that India&rsquo;s contribution to this growing global business is a mere 1%, while China controls 85%. &ldquo;The Chinese have a traditional medicine research unit in Shanghai that is funded by the government. Why can&rsquo;t we do the same for ayurveda here?&rdquo; he asks.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"India''s contribution to the global herbal medicines market is a mere 1%, while China controls 85%" - Bhagyanath Menon, CEO, Care Keralam</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">It took 15 months to create the NKK scientific dossier, says Verghese. Of the total expenditure of Rs 35 lakh, NInC part funded the project with Rs 18 lakh. Now, he adds, NInC has given an in-principle go-ahead to extend this to 10 more ayurvedic formulations. &ldquo;128 of the 500-odd classical ayurvedic formulations with us generate 85% of sales for the industry in India. The commercial market is mainly for these,&rdquo; adds Menon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Stumbling blocks</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Barring Kerala and Krishnagiri, the results in most clusters haven&rsquo;t been exactly encouraging, with cluster members yet to wholeheartedly adopt the innovations worked upon in the pilot projects. The problem with the Ahmedabad life sciences cluster, though, was different. Two of the existing pharma bodies said they didn&rsquo;t quite understand what NInC was trying to do &mdash; connect entrepreneurs with exciting innovations already created in the biotech space and help them seed businesses around these.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With the Gujarat State Biotechnology Mission, the local partner, NInC narrowed down the search to the MSME Foundation&rsquo;s biotech entrepreneur training programme. The Foundation connected the council to CSIR for the list of technologies in the biotech space that could be commercially viable. It took eight months but NInC finally got a list of 20 such technologies. Four students have identified topics that emerged out CSIR&rsquo;s Chennai and Lucknow labs. One of the innovations is a skin-coloured patch with embedded medication.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;We have been trying to get CSIR to license these technologies at a nominal price,&rdquo; says Kala. For the patch, CSIR quoted a price of Rs 8.5 crore, which was obviously too steep a cost for an entrepreneur. NInC is working to get that price lowered. &ldquo;There has to be a policy shift. You cannot work the way you do with big companies. The idea is to take a developmental view,&rdquo; he points out.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"There has to be a policy shift. You cannot work the way you do with big companies" - Keerthi Laal Kala, project leader</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The Ahmedabad programme has also instituted the Innovation Research Reward for biotech projects in universities. This is to help potential entrepreneurs in the space take their research to the next level, seek funding and get help with the patent process. So far, 20 such interested entrepreneurs have presented their ideas to a panel comprising IP lawyers, angel investors and pharma companies.</p>\n<p class="p3">There were other challenges and learnings from the pilots in other places, too. For instance, while the training programmes were conducted fully in only three clusters, Kala admits that they could have been less theoretical. &ldquo;Some were premature, such as the one on innovation management,&rdquo; says Kala. He adds that the idea of a CIC (Cluster Innovation Centre) didn&rsquo;t exactly work out the way it was intended to but took different forms that eventually got the job done. &ldquo;As long as the services are provided, we felt it was fine.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Anil Gupta, a professor at IIM Ahmedabad and vice-chair, National Innovation Foundation, is among the members of NInC that ran the clusters initiative. Upset with the way the programme was rolled out, Gupta says he often voiced his protest during NInC meetings. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very unhappy that a great idea wasn&rsquo;t executed properly. For instance, why did Moradabad not go beyond one furnace? Why couldn&rsquo;t they do 10?&rdquo; Gupta asks. Disagreeing with Ohri&rsquo;s argument that the cost of adoption is the main reason why the artisans haven&rsquo;t gone in for the new design furnace, he says, &ldquo;There was no mechanism created for demand through demonstration beyond a single prototype. What would have been the cost of creating 10 hotspots of creativity within the cluster? Not much.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">The trouble, according to Gupta, is that the innovation clusters programme was done in a &ldquo;top-down manner&rdquo;. A long-time proponent of local and grassroots innovation through Sristi and the Honey Bee Network, he contends that while the involvement of national-level scientific research bodies under CSIR was a step in the right direction, the effectiveness of the exercise was limited due to non-involvement of local institutions. &ldquo;You must link local institutions with local challenges,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Incremental/adaptive research can only be local.&rdquo; The proximity makes exchange of ideas and the innovation process more operationally feasible, he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The programme was done in a top-down manner. It was destined to fail and it failed" - Anil Gupta, vice-chair, National Innovation Foundation</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Gupta says he had a three-year &ldquo;running battle&rdquo; with Pitroda on the functioning of NInC and the clusters programme. &ldquo;Somehow, they had closed their minds. Sam would not understand,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It was destined to fail and it failed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">The criticism notwithstanding, NInC has recommended to the programme&rsquo;s state and sectoral councils to replicate this exercise in more clusters in every state. Of these, Haryana has been the first off the block, identifying five more clusters for the programme, with Karnataka and Maharashtra, too, embarking on a similar exercise. &ldquo;We have energised people. We have taken the genie out of the bottle,&rdquo; says Pitroda. Will this continue with the new government? &ldquo;It is for the new government to decide what they should do.

(118, 24, '', 'The whole six yards', '<p class="p1">Growing up in a bicultural environment in the US, Nasscom Foundation CEO Rita Soni looked forward to the few chances she got to sport <em>desi</em> clothes. For years, she wistfully rifled through her mum&rsquo;s closet, wondering if, like her, she would have to keep waiting for a chance to wear the beautiful sarees hanging there. Once Soni took over as Yes Bank&rsquo;s country head for responsible banking practices, however, she realised that the financial services industry in India boasted of many senior professionals who had resurrected the saree as a corporate uniform.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;They were confidently carrying off these sarees, oozing elegance, sophistication and professionalism. I then started wearing sarees to my speaking engagements and realised that not only did I carry myself differently, but people saw me differently as well; it sent out a very positive message. It became a habit and continues to be a source of strength,&rdquo; says Soni.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Thanks to her spirited defence of the saree as everyday office wear, Soni was recently part of a discussion at an initiative aimed at celebrating the saree and its makers &mdash; The Saree Festival, held in New Delhi. &ldquo;Though it was a daunting task to share the dais with Padma Shri awardees and celebrated designers, I loved the opportunity to learn more about the subject. One of our main concerns was that sarees are becoming &lsquo;special occasion&rsquo; wear &mdash; reduced to being aired out only for a wedding or some other traditional social function,&rdquo; says Soni. &ldquo;However, we were all happy that on an average, we have moved past the era when traditional clothes were rejected as part of an empowerment ideal. Now, many women see them as a natural professional choice for work &mdash; a sign that they are empowered enough to choose what they want to wear. Personally, I love that I can choose what to wear &mdash; a power suit one day, a power saree the next.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">As the seasons change, Soni alternates between weaves: from breezy cottons in summer to raw silk and Benarasis or even woollen yarns in the biting cold. &ldquo;I have been on several saree walks curated by the organiser of the saree festival, Himanshu Verma. The one I enjoyed most featured the making of a <em>bandhani</em> saree, which, being a Gujarati, I guess I share a genetic predisposition towards,&rdquo; she laughs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Starting from those she selected from her mother&rsquo;s closet, Soni built her 50-strong saree collection by picking one up from each place she travelled to. &ldquo;In Bangladesh for work a few years ago, I remember buying a beautiful handwoven white and gold saree. I&rsquo;ve picked up pieces from places such as Bhubhaneswar, Kolkata and Mumbai, though I am still to buy silks from south India. When I left Yes Bank, my colleagues gifted me a traditional Maharashtrian saree, which I cherish and wear often. I think it is better to receive something like that instead of a memento that will sit in your showcase and be of no use,&rdquo; she says. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Soni does not limit her penchant for ethnic wear to events in India &mdash; she makes it a point to sport her collection during work commitments and black tie events abroad, having done so on recent trips to Colombia, the US, the UK and France. &ldquo;As an Indian-American, it helps me emphasise the fact that I am based in India now. Reactions abroad may range from &lsquo;that looks so complicated, how do you wear it&rsquo; to &lsquo;that looks elegant&rsquo; but the reception is always positive. Back in India, my sarees may send out a traditional vibe but the moment people hear my pronounced accent, they realise that I am committed to my work here and that I mean business,&rdquo; smiles Soni. Here&rsquo;s to the power saree, then.&nbsp;</p>', 'Clothes make the woman, at least when it comes to local handlooms, believes Nasscom Foundation CEO Rita Soni', '12', '', 0, '', 'the-whole-six-yards-118', 113, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'The whole six yards', 'Clothes make the woman, at least when it comes to local handlooms, believes NASSCOM', '', '', '', 'Nasscom Foundation,Rita Soni,Handloom sarees,The Saree Festival', 0, NULL, '2015-01-17 18:55:42', NULL, '2014-07-05', 0),
(119, 24, '', 'Travelling in style', '<p class="p1">Remember the holdall? That huge mattress-lined, roll-up bag with thick leather straps, which could hold most of any traveller&rsquo;s needs for at least a week or two? The arrival of sleeker travel luggage may have forced the holdall into retirement, but the holdall has been given a new lease in Corneliani&rsquo;s new range of travel gear. It isn&rsquo;t massive &mdash; in fact, it is quite small, is good to stuff with what you might require for a quick overnighter, provided you like travelling light &mdash; and unlike its canvas predecessor, it&rsquo;s made of calfskin and lined with jacquard.</p>\n<p class="p3">At any Indian airport, it&rsquo;s not unusual anymore to see travellers rolling out sleek bags from the cabin, into the airport and back out again, stopping only for a cappuccino on the go. The world of luxury travel gear is catching on so fast that you will end up being a dodo if, like most people, you&rsquo;re still wondering whether the red suitcase with a yellow ribbon is distinctive enough to stand out in a sea of similar looking, mass-produced bags on the conveyor belt. The cognoscenti, on the other hand, carry their matched bags that sport their favourite logos, indifferent to the fact that baggage handlers will leave them scuffed and lined anyway. True luxury means never having to feel sorry that your Louis Vuitton bags look better travelled than you.</p>\n<p class="p3">Louis Vuitton, in fact, probably had a first-mover advantage in India, with maharajas signing up for its trunks and cases, beautifully apportioned to hold every last cufflink and tie in a separate compartment. But that was when even neighbourhood stores stocked beautifully handcrafted leather suitcases &mdash; alas, since thrown away by most of us in a cleaning frenzy. Think of what great collectibles they would have made today.</p>\n<p class="p3">Those were fairly basic days. You had trunks to load onto steamers for long journeys, the ubiquitous holdall for local sojourns, all of them accompanied by attach&eacute; cases. Not anymore though, when there&rsquo;s a travel bag for every need, in every size. With most travellers preferring cabin baggage, the choice of luxury bags comes with wheels, handles and shoulder straps &mdash; talk about adaptability. The equivalent of Corneliani&rsquo;s holdall is Louis Vuitton&rsquo;s keepall, rounded on the top for a soft silhouette and accompanied by an attach&eacute; case with a prominent leather frame and brass trims.</p>\n<p class="p3">Of course, the big deal about Louis Vuitton&rsquo;s travel bags is its logo, whether on suitcases or backpacks. Though corporate types might prefer formal travel gear, creative hotshots like something that&rsquo;s less restrictive, plumbing for the rucksack instead, though never without the logo. After all, they need something to tell them apart from the real backpackers.</p>\n<p class="p3">Some like Hugo Boss&rsquo;s small but smart range of travel gear that looks beyond mere logos for its workbags, reporter (ahem, ahem) bags, messenger bags and weekenders. But Ermenegildo Zegna&rsquo;s range is more persuasive, with shoulder bags and wheeled bags, office and laptop bags and a garment bag in which to carry suits aboard an aircraft so that you never have to worry about creases or arriving late for a meeting just because the jacket wasn&rsquo;t in a fit state to wear. Though it&rsquo;s more expensive than Boss, when it comes to sporting a logo &mdash; whether prominently or subtly &mdash; a couple of thousand more or less hardly matter.

Of course, it&rsquo;s nothing new for the writer duo to rock the boat with provocative titles &mdash; Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner are the same people who wrote the bestselling <em>Freakonomics</em>. And before too long you move beyond the name to realise this is a classic motivational book with several fascinating aspects.The bookis a page-turner, which I finished reading in just a day. As you flip through the pages, it takes you on a journey of self-discovery that lasts long after you put the book down.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;&nbsp; But first, what is a freak? The distinguishing characteristic of a freak: viewing the world in an unbiased manner. I was able to relate to the authors&rsquo; writings quite easily, as I believe my thought process is quite similar to theirs. The book advises one to think differently when stuck in a problematic situation. The idea of distinguishing oneself while being insulated from social pressure is fascinating.</p>\n<p class="p2">One standout portion relates to questioning research by revising one&rsquo;s way of thinking. For instance, the book illustrates how a study claims that 90% of married people are happy. However, thinking like a freak would turn that on its head and instead ask if it could be that 90% of happy people get married?</p>\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;The most important lesson lies in Chapter Three, titled &lsquo;What&rsquo;s your problem?&rsquo;. Understanding and rephrasing the problem is the way to find success and avenues for innovation.&nbsp;There are two ways to look at everything in life and the same holds true for this book. I see it as an optimistic approach to trigger new thoughts. It was well written and was full of adventures.</p>\n<p class="p2">Levitt and Dubner have given real-life examples of people who have followed the right line of thought, which resulted in positive outcomes for them. Reading about anecdotes such as Van Halen&rsquo;s brown M&amp;M rule for concerts, the mythology of King Solomon and the life of David Lee Roth was inspiring, as well as entertaining. In particular, I was inspired by a quote by Sir Isaac Newton, reproduced in the book: &ldquo;To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age. &lsquo;Tis much better to do a little with certainty and leave the rest for others that come after than to explain all things by conjecture without making sure of any thing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><em>Think Like a Freak</em> is an incredible self-help book for those who are constrained by conventional thinking. I could connect to the book like a fellow traveller. The book taught me that every situation has endless possibilities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Insights</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p2"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Voting in a vacuum?</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1">In an evolving marketplace, institutional investors have become dominant stakeholders in many firms.

(123, 12, '', 'Sweet Tooth', '<p class="p1">Vikram Vora has a pretty simple way of deciding if he wants to open a clinic in a particular area or not: he just looks around for the nearest ICICI Bank ATM or Caf&eacute; Coffee Day outlet. &ldquo;It is a good indicator of how densely populated a place is. So far, this strategy has worked very well for us,&rdquo; says the founder and CEO of MyDentist, a chain of dental clinics that has 80 outlets across Mumbai, Pune and Surat. That strategy seems to have worked, with MyDentist needing to shut down just one clinic since it set up shop in 2011. A first-generation entrepreneur, Vora set up MyDentist with his younger brother, Parth, the director and CFO. Within their first fiscal, the brothers had touched 13 clinics, adding 26 to the tally the following year.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;&ldquo;We have a conservative approach to business and hence our expansion process has been gradual,&rdquo; says Vora, whose company had a topline of Rs 25 crore for FY13. It is quite clear that Vora is not a man in a hurry. His product offering &mdash; an affordable chain of dental clinics &mdash; is very massy and he speaks candidly of counting even autorickshaw drivers among its customers. &ldquo;Our customers don&rsquo;t walk in expecting us to help improve their smile. Their needs are extremely curative in nature,&rdquo; says Vora, whose green T-shirt rather appropriately reads &lsquo;smile more, pay less&rsquo;. The immediate task at hand for Vora is to get to 150 clinics in the current fiscal and to 250 by the end of FY16. These are still bit figures, given that there are barely 220 clinics between the top four players in India, and the total size of the dental care services market, according to the Indian Dental Association, is currently just $1.16 billion, up from $660 million in 2009. Contrast this with the fact that India has just 1.8 lakh dentists for a population of 1.2 billion and the market potential becomes quite clear.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Teething trouble</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Vora has been quite busy of late, what with MyDentist having opened five clinics over the last two months in Surat. This was preceded by 13 clinics in Pune. &ldquo;We can practically open a clinic anywhere in today&rsquo;s date, be it Guwahati or Kanyakumari,&rdquo; the 34-year-old says with a smile. Clearly, the brothers have got a hang of what it takes to make a clinic work, though the learning has not come easy, as Vora readily admits.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Like most successful startup stories, this, too, featured an element of chance. Anand Lunia, former executive director and CFO, Seedfund, and Vora&rsquo;s former boss at Lionbridge, in 2010 asked the latter to come up with a business plan. Once Vora, an engineer and MBA grad with a stint at ICICI Bank, set up what was then known as Total Dental Care with a total of five clinics, Lunia pointed out that scalability was key in the success of his venture. &ldquo;My targets were modest. I told him we would like to open 30 clinics in three years and needed Rs 70 lakh for the same,&rdquo; grins Vora. In July that year, Seedfund agreed to incubate Vora&rsquo;s dental business.</p>\n<p class="p3">Securing the initial investment of Rs 1 crore was just the beginning of the story. For Vora, turning entrepreneur was something he had been planning for a long time, though very little time was spent thinking about aspects such as branding. &ldquo;A very significant contribution from Seedfund was to suggest a change in the name and colour of our brand identity,&rdquo; says Vora. Various names, including My Tooth Fairy, were considered, before the brothers zeroed in on MyDentist against a green background. &ldquo;Frankly, my awareness of a crucial aspect such as branding was quite poor,&rdquo; says Vora. There was another thing to be understood &mdash; such businesses take time to stabilise. &ldquo;I had to get rid of my Gujju mindset that attached a stigma to loss,&rdquo; he laughs, reminding us that the business took off on just Rs 6 lakh in family savings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Today, MyDentist remains in the red as it is still in expansion mode. &ldquo;Ours is a compact format, where each clinic is only 350 square feet, with a capex of Rs 30 lakh. Most of this is invested in equipment and furniture, while the running costs include staff salaries, rent and electricity,&rdquo; says Parth. A new clinic typically sees 50 customers per month during its first two months of operation. &ldquo;Once the business matures, the number of visits goes up to about 10-15 treatments per day,&rdquo; he explains. That is quite evident at the outlet at Vile Parle, in suburban Mumbai, MyDentist&rsquo;s first clinic, which features a modest waiting area and two dentists. On a Tuesday afternoon, one customer is already undergoing treatment, while another has just walked in. &ldquo;We break even at a revenue of around Rs 3.5 lakh per clinic per month,&rdquo; explains Parth. Today, MyDentist employs 600 dentists, with their average age being less than 30.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Given their small-sized operations, players such as MyDentist have managed to proliferate quite easily, though that is not necessarily the norm in the industry. Take the case of Alliance Dental care, a joint venture between Apollo Hospitals and Trivitron Healthcare, which operates under the Apollo White Dental brand and caters to a premium clientele. Today, the chain operates 50 clinics across 13 cities. It has three formats: dental spas, clinics and hospital implants. The minimum time taken to break even is 5-6 months, with the spas, which cover an area of at least 3,500 square feet, taking as much as 15-18 months. The company&rsquo;s CEO, VS Venkatesh, says the big change in the business is that people are coming in not just for illness dentistry. &ldquo;It is more about wellness today, with an aesthetic and cosmetic angle involved,&rdquo; he points out. Over the next two years, Alliance Dental is looking to be a 450-clinic chain.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Dentistry is more about wellness today, with an aesthetic and cosmetic angle involved" - VS Venkatesh, CEO, Apollo White Dental Spa</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Interestingly, most chains, barring Alliance Dental, have chosen to stick to a certain region and this move is backed by sound logic. Amarinder Singh, CEO, Star Dental India, the owners of the Clove Dental clinics, which have a presence in Delhi and the NCR, points out that it is easier to have high quality standards this way. &ldquo;Besides, it leads to economies of scale, which help us in driving costs down. Much of this is possible only when you have a multiple-location model in one region,&rdquo; he explains. According to Singh, the savings are in form of technology and fees paid to the doctor, among other costs. &ldquo;It is precisely for this reason that dental clinics in India like the idea of being concentrated in one geography,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Getting ambitious</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The transition to a more organised format is what has tickled people like Vora. By just being affordable, his firm has managed to reach out to over two lakh patients, of those 1.3 lakh during the last fiscal alone. In terms of revenue, he says MyDentist has doubled revenues every year for the last two years. &ldquo;We should continue at this growth rate for at least the next two years,&rdquo; adds Vora.</p>\n<p class="p3">Of course, this kind of growth has impressed Seedfund a great deal. &ldquo;From our point of view, we are very comfortable with an enterprise that has a large addressable clientele. It should not be restricted to just a base of high-paying customers,&rdquo; says Pravin Gandhi, founding partner, Seedfund. If MyDentist used exactly that approach, the opportunity was very obvious in the minds of the investor. &ldquo;Indians do not really value dental treatment. For a player to succeed in this business, he must make the service not just affordable but also very accessible,&rdquo; emphasises Gandhi.</p>\n<p class="p3">Seedfund had a straightforward way of looking at the business model. Gandhi says the objective for each clinic is to achieve operational break-even in three to six months and deliver a return on investment in about two years. That is something that Vora has been able to achieve in Mumbai and even more easily in Surat, where it has achieved break-even in just two months. There, each outlet is at least 800 square feet, which means MyDentist can install more chairs and treat more people. That&rsquo;s not all. &ldquo;People come in for root canal treatment, which is more expensive. We have noticed that people spend a lot more in a place like Surat, which was a bit of a revelation,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">The rub in the business is that it is just plain unpredictable. Vora is candid when he says that customers will come calling only when they are in agony. &ldquo;This is typically after they have tried clove oil and popped in a few Brufen tablets,&rdquo; he says with a wry smile. Given that the average person is meant to visit a dentist at least once in six months, the reality is that most Indians have been to a dentist barely on a couple of occasions in their lifetime. &ldquo;In this scenario, making a business forecast is quite a challenge,&rdquo; admits Vora.</p>\n<p class="p3">Gandhi is aware of this peculiarity in the business. &ldquo;Yes, it is an area of concern and not something that one can wish away. However, the trick is that by being accessible, you are creating a habit in the minds of the patient, increasing the number of visits,&rdquo; he maintains. MyDentist has also attempted to use the analytics route to address this challenge. &ldquo;Through this, it is somewhat possible to predict the future based on what has taken place in the past,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">Much of this will bank on MyDentist&rsquo;s ability to bring in more people to the clinic, and a big incentive towards that end is the price. Vora insists that he charges barely half of the going rate in the business, ensuring that his model is massy in nature. A basic cleaning per sitting at MyDentist costs Rs 300, while the cheapest root canal treatment is Rs 2,500, compared with Rs 600 and Rs 4,000, respectively, at a larger clinic. Again, the cheapest orthodontic treatment costs Rs 21,000 at MyDentist, while it is almost impossible to pull it off at anything less than Rs 30,000 elsewhere. That apart, MyDentist also offers a flexible payment option to its patients.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Teeth smart - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Amit Sachdeva, director and promoter, Axiss Dental, agrees that there is a pyramid structure for dentists in India, with the top practitioners occupying the top part of it. &ldquo;The upper middle class is the one that is our audience and that occupies the top 15% percentile of the population,&rdquo; he says. Axiss Dental is the largest in the business, with revenues in excess of Rs 30 crore and a chain of 65 clinics across NCR, Punjab and Bengaluru. Its presence in the south was the result of Axiss buying out Narayana Hrudayalaya Dental Clinic. Sachdeva is clear that healthcare services cannot flourish at lower costs. &ldquo;Quality does come at a cost,&rdquo; he says quite firmly.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The upper middle class is our audince and top 15% of the populace. Quality comes at a cost" - Amit Sachdeva, director and promoter, Axiss Dental</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Moving from the mom-and-pop scenario to running a chain is something that even smaller players have done. Take the case of Denty&rsquo;s, a chain owned by Hyderabad-based Today&rsquo;s Healthcare India, with a five-clinic operation in five cities across Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. In the case of the former, it has a presence in tier 2 and 3 cities like Vijayawada and Kakinada. In May this year, Denty&rsquo;s attracted a Rs 27-crore fund infusion from Helion Venture Partners, an early- to mid-stage India-focused venture fund.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Being in a smaller market brings some serious advantages to the table. &ldquo;It is possible to be very big in a small market. In time, it gives the player a disproportionate share of the market,&rdquo; points out Ritesh Banglani, director, Helion. He says that Denty&rsquo;s caters to the mid-market segment, which remains a huge market opportunity. &ldquo;Of course, big cities have a lot of potential. But tier 2 and 3 cities form the periphery strategy for a player like Denty&rsquo;s,&rdquo; points out Banglani, whose fund has had other investments in healthcare such as EyeQ, a specialty eye hospital chain, and LifeCell, a stem cell bank. On the issue of the transition to a more organised structure in the dental clinic business, Banglani says there is a serious factor at work here. &ldquo;Chains can attract specialists who can work across clinics. More importantly, these chains can invest in high-end equipment, which is not such an easy decision for mom-and-pop establishments,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">A more organised structure in the dental care market is not unique to India. Ajay Kumar Vij, co-founder and CEO, Asian Healthcare Fund, a growth-stage healthcare-focused private equity fund that invested Rs 40 crore in MyDentist last April, calls this the corporatisation of dental practice. According to him, the US has several clinic chains such as Aspen Dentals and Great Expression Dentals, while the UK too has Southern Dental and IDG.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"It is a relatively low capex-intensive business and offers a model that is highly scalable" - Ajay Kumar Vij, CEO, Asian Healthcare Foundation</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;The challenges of running a single practice clinic and the advantages that organised play delivers will ensure long-term growth for organised dental chains,&rdquo; says Vij. He says there were a couple of key areas that drew his fund to MyDentist. &ldquo;It is a relatively low capex-intensive business and offers a model that is highly scalable. That apart, the focus on the large and relatively unaddressed mass market made us very comfortable,&rdquo; he says. That&rsquo;s pretty much Vora&rsquo;s way of looking at the market as well.

(124, 16, '', 'The big kick-off', '<p class="p1">On Gurudwara Road in central Delhi&rsquo;s bustling and crowded Karol Bagh market, it is easy to miss the nondescript, grey four-storey building that houses Aero Group&rsquo;s corporate office. Entering the reception, you feel as if you have been transported to a trading house from the 1980s. The ageing paint and weathered wood paneling gives the sense of a company steeped in its past, nowhere close to the youthful and vibrant image of Woodland, the popular homegrown adventure brand it represents. That is, until you step into the cramped but modern elevator that takes you up to the first floor. Here, gleaming workspaces, open layouts, wall cabinets whose doors cleverly double up as writing boards all give out a fresh vibe of a company gearing up for the future. Clearly, Woodland is a brand that&rsquo;s being refreshed for a new innings. The transformational process has been underway for some time now, says MD Harkirat Singh. &ldquo;We needed to reinvent the way we do business, because if we didn&rsquo;t change, somebody else would have come in,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Since its launch in 1992, Woodland has single-handedly built a small category &mdash; outdoor lifestyle &mdash; and grown it through a mix of sharply targeted advertising for its young buyers, community building and events and alliances with environmental organisations such as the World Wildlife Fund and the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund. In doing so, it has cleverly straddled an expanding adventure gear market. &ldquo;Woodland connects with the outdoor lifestyle image without being dependent on it,&rdquo; agrees Devangshu Dutta, CEO, Third Eyesight, a retail consulting firm. Now, Singh and his team are upping the ante. Preparations have been underway for a couple of years: a new line of innovative products has been unveiled and the brand extended into specialised categories within the adventure and outdoors space. Take, for instance, shoes and garments used in mountaineering, trekking, cycling and equipment for rappelling. The idea was to address the needs of entry-level users and not necessarily professional climbers and trekkers to begin with. &ldquo;Some products need safety approvals and we may not go for them right now,&rdquo; points out Singh. For sourcing such products, it has tied up with global manufacturers. A few of these products have already been introduced, such as GoPro outdoor cameras and climbing stick sourced from an Italian company, and trekking umbrellas from a German supplier.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The initial response has been encouraging, prompting Woodland to work on a plan to introduce five to ten new products each year. &ldquo;Right now, I am holding a Woodland shoe with Gore-Tex lining and a Vibram sole, which will cost you only Rs 8,000 a pair,&rdquo; says Singh, who is down south visiting the company&rsquo;s Kochi store. The point Singh wants to make is this: Woodland makes shoes that are comparable with global brands.</p>\n<p class="p3">But old-time sellers such as Avinash Kamath of Mumbai&rsquo;s Avi Industries haven&rsquo;t heard of these yet. He remembers the company&rsquo;s traditional range being perceived as rugged but bulky and unsuitable for climbing mountains. &ldquo;Their shoes are 50% heavier compared with European brands,&rdquo; he says. Started by his father in the &rsquo;70s, the business is run by Kamath, a seasoned mountaineer. Stores such as Avi, Adventure18 in Delhi and Cliff Climbers in Dehradun have been the go-to places for gear for professional or early mountaineers. They are also the key influencers for the category, which grows mainly by word-of-mouth. Kamath is pleasantly surprised when told about Woodland&rsquo;s advanced range. &ldquo;If they have such products, they should be promoting them.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s exactly what Woodland is trying to do with marketing and innovation.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Brand push</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">From selling shoes to adding apparel (extending into a more formal line of wear under the Woods brand), the Rs 1,000-crore group has come a long way from its origins as a supplier of finished leather uppers to footwear manufacturers across the globe. An impulsive decision to replicate a design that the Aero Group was manufacturing for an Italian client and test it in the Karol Bagh market led to the creation of a brand that is now available in 4,000 multi-brand outlets and boasts of 450 exclusive showrooms in around 200 cities. In the past few years, Woodland has been clocking 13% to 18% growth (<em>see: On a firm footing</em>), compared with 20% for the overall footwear and apparel market. But Singh is in no hurry to grow any faster. Though he wants the company, which earns 60% of its revenues from footwear, to be seen as a more entrenched and focused player in the outdoor wear and adventure gear business, which currently accounts for a negligible share of revenues.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>On a firm footing- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The reason &mdash; the adventure sports market is gradually picking up pace in India on the back of corporate outbound programmes and a general sense of awareness through television. Trekking, climbing and rapelling have been most popular in that regard. It&rsquo;s a category that barely existed among the most passionate of adventure lovers &mdash; trekkers, mountain hikers and climbing enthusiasts. &ldquo;The outdoor category is a huge universe. We are addressing only a small part,&rdquo; says Singh. And the company is doing that by creating awareness of the category, celebrating everyday heroes. Woodland&rsquo;s brand ambassadors include people such as Loveraj Singh Dharmshaktu, an assistant commandant in the Border Security Force who has climbed Mt Everest five times; Planning Commission employee and ace endurance runner Arun Bhardwaj; Deeya Suzannah Bajaj, who at 14 was the first and youngest Indian to go kayaking in the Arctic Ocean in Greenland; and Archana Sardana, who is the country&rsquo;s first woman B.A.S.E. jumper, skydiver and scuba diving instructor. Woodland, in fact, developed special gear &mdash; a flappy bird-like jacket &mdash; for Sardana for B.A.S.E. jumping, considered among the riskiest sports since it involves leaping off buildings and bridges with a small parachute.</p>\n<p class="p3">Apart from using images and videos of these ambassadors and sharing details of their achievements on its website, Woodland also leverages them as field testers for its ongoing product development and design process. Dharmshaktu, who has been tapped for his feedback on a new range of jackets, has also been hired as a consultant for an upcoming adventure zone being created on the outskirts of Delhi. Located on a 100-acre property on the Faridabad-Gurgaon Road at the foothills of the Aravallis, Singh says the zone, which is likely to be ready in six months, will serve as an events hub to connect with its audience and demonstrate its newer range of mountain gear.</p>\n<p class="p3">True to its Timberland-inspired positioning, Woodland has stayed consistent over the years about what it stands for &mdash; rugged, outdoorsy and for people with a desire to explore and seek adventure. Communication, too, has remained largely consistent with the brand&rsquo;s core values. &ldquo;Over the years, it&rsquo;s been the most well-defined brand I&rsquo;ve worked on,&rdquo; says Tanul Bhartiya, senior VP at Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners, the agency that&rsquo;s been handling the brand since its launch in India, now under division Karishma Advertising. While Woodland&rsquo;s advertising is largely print-centric, over the years, there has been a greater push towards digital marketing to stay connected with its target group &mdash; 18-24 year olds. The rethink process was kicked off four years ago, when Singh enrolled for a two-week <em>Taking Marketing Digital </em>course at Harvard Business School with Amol Dhillon, vice-president, strategy and planning. That led to a digital marketing push for the brand that continues over popular platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube. Woodland now has 3.2 million fans on Facebook and 6,000 followers on Twitter. Its in-house social media content team is currently working on a Woodland TV app for iOS and Android, and a quarterly digital adventure magazine modelled along the lines of Redbull&rsquo;s <em>Red Bulletin</em>. &ldquo;Brands have to be their own content creators,&rdquo; says Dhillon.&nbsp;All these initiatives assume importance as the larger market for adventure and sports goods opens up in the country.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Bring it on</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Though not in direct competition, Woodland will now have to contend with newer players entering its turf, even as older rivals cede ground. French sports and adventure goods retailer Decathlon is now available in India &mdash; its Quechua label is a popular brand among mountaineers and Woodland is watching its progress carefully. On familiar turf, Woodland has managed to ward off a larger threat from Timberland, the brand it&rsquo;s said to be inspired from. The popular New England (US) brand, which changed ownership in 2011 to North Carolina-based VF Corporation, is represented in India by Reliance Brands. The resemblance has been uncanny right down to the logo. But with 14 points of sale that include eight brand stores and six shop-in-shops, the iconic brand &mdash; know &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;n for its signature Yellow Boot &mdash; has settled to &ldquo;peacefully coexist&rdquo; with Woodland after filing for intellectual property (IP) infringement and losing the case in 2012 as the latter was the first mover in India. In what should be music to Singh&rsquo;s ears, Darshan Mehta, CEO, Reliance Brands, points out that Reliance is unlikely to renew Timberland&rsquo;s brand licensing agreement for India that comes to an end by mid-2015. &ldquo;We had already stopped expanding [Timberland outlets] a year back,&rdquo; adds Mehta.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>What''s on offer- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Woodland has been aggressively adding 60-70 stores every year, and this year will see similar numbers, Singh says. &ldquo;We are more conservative in our new store additions since we do not follow a franchisee model.&rdquo; With a footprint extending to towns such as Thodupuzha (Kerala), Ambikapur (Chattisgarh), Barnala (Punjab) and Hamirpur (UP), Singh is confident of introducing new lines to every corner of the country.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But it won&rsquo;t be a cakewalk for Woodland. Professional users of outdoor gear aren&rsquo;t really Woodland&rsquo;s core customers: they depend on globally established brands that are specialists in each line of adventure goods. Hardcore mountaineers, for instance, swear by brands such as Quechua, Merrell, Lafuma, North Face, Mountain Hardwear and Millet, even though they are far more expensive &mdash; in the Rs 10,000-Rs 14,000 range on average. Also, leading brands use the Gore-Tex waterproof leather treatment or its equivalent, which is a must for professional climbers, who often climb in snow. Similarly, Vibram outsoles, with their non-slippery grip, are de rigueur in trekking and climbing shoes. &ldquo;I would never recommend [Woodland&nbsp; shoes] in their current state for high-altitude trekking. These shoes are very heavy,&rdquo; says a mountaineer who runs her own adventure sports firm. Atul Anand, director, Cliff Climbers says, &ldquo;Woodlands&rsquo; shoes are not at all comparable to technical products.&rdquo; Shoes are among the three elements of a good trek along with a light and well-designed backpack and the right kind of clothes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s clear that even as the brand ambassador programme is creating the right buzz for its potential and current customers, there are enough gaps in this sphere. Many of these influencers aren&rsquo;t informed about or convinced of its professional line of products.&nbsp;Singh is aware of the challenges that the brand faces and it&rsquo;s not surprising that he&rsquo;s looking to up the ante &mdash; by focusing on innovation and evolving their products to appeal to the serious adventurer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>By design</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">It all happened when Singh, who was already thinking of ways to innovate, heard about IDEO&rsquo;s design innovation course at Stanford University. Last year, Singh and Dhillon attended the intensive five-day programme, where they picked up lessons on consumer centricity through IDEO&rsquo;s famed design thinking framework. As part of the course module, Singh and Dhillon had to spend time inside Los Angeles International Airport chatting up 20 passengers at random to understand their needs and concerns relating to airline services, boarding and check-in procedures. That module was for US carrier JetBlue, which had roped in IDEO to design a service offering that would appeal to frequent travellers and those passengers who are willing to pay more &mdash; and generate new revenue &mdash; without alienating its core customers. Through this exercise, the duo picked up cues on designing a better service experience for the Woodland brand back home. &ldquo;It changed our way of thinking. We came back with an open mind to talk to our customers,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Back in India, Singh was quick to organise brainstorming sessions for each vertical of the business, from marketing to store sales and from manufacturing to design. Product ideas were discussed, so were ways to improve store productivity. &ldquo;We asked our store sales people to talk to customers about what matters to them and use that understanding to help us improve our offerings and service,&rdquo; says Singh. As it turned out, the feedback was that customers were looking for something &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo;.</p>\n<p class="p3">Armed with this new insight, Singh got down to raising the bar for Woodland. It began with technology, as Woodland roped in &lsquo;geeks&rsquo; to introduce new features into its products. Over the past six months, the company has rolled out a slew of new products as part of the initiative. One such product is a shoe that allows blind people to trek. Another one, developed with the help of former NASA scientists, is a battery-operated jacket with heating pads that regulate temperature on long treks and sub-zero climes. Then there&rsquo;s the ResQ jacket, which is embedded with the RECCO directional radar &lsquo;reflector&rsquo; chip for precise location search in case its wearer gets caught in an avalanche. The signals from the chip can be detected up to depths of 30 metre below ice, and it runs without a battery. There are warm grip shoes to ward off frostbite at temperatures up to -20 degrees Celsius, powered by a lithium-ion battery and a warming coil fitted into the outsole. Woodland has also come out with outdoor bags fitted with solar powered chargers for mobile phones and other gadgets and is recycling plastic into fibre to make garments. Some of these ideas also came from the technology and outdoor sports-focused Consumer Electronics Show, an annual exhibition held every year in Las Vegas to showcase innovation in consumer technologies, and Ispo Munich, the world&rsquo;s largest platform for young entrepreneurs in the sporting goods business.</p>\n<p class="p3">Woodland is also backing up the new products with a campaign scripted by Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners, titled &lsquo;Live to tell the tale&rsquo;, which showcases gear for adventurers to survive the harsh outdoors. The campaign, comprising outdoor hoardings, print ads and TV commercials, revolves around outdoor enthusiasts being rescued from tough situations.</p>\n<p class="p3">Since the new innovations rely on technology, Woodland has taken the licensing route on the specific applications it uses them for. For example, the technology for the ResQ jacket is owned by Swedish company RECCO. Woodland pays it a royalty, plus a percentage of sales if the volumes are larger. These products are priced much higher and meant for specific or extreme uses. The jackets with heating pads, for example, are priced between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000 each. &ldquo;These products are highlighters for our range. We don&rsquo;t look for huge volumes on them,&rdquo; says Singh. So the reflector radar jackets launched last season (winter) at a similar price band sold around 7,000 units, compared with the bestselling jacket, priced around Rs 4,000-Rs 6,000, which sold up to two lakh units in a year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">These and the mainline products are manufactured across four locations &mdash; Baddi and Paonta Sahib for shoes, Dehradun and, recently, Roorkee for jackets and shoes. Jackets are also sourced from Bangladesh, while some products are sourced from factories in Vietnam and China. With an installed capacity of 500,000 pairs of shoes 200,000 pieces of apparel each month, the group&rsquo;s manufacturing employs advanced and more precision-oriented techniques now to cater to the more demanding domestic market and an export business growing at 35% as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Singh, however, is unwilling to quantify the impact that new additions will bring to the business, even as he is banking on Woodland&rsquo;s extensive reach for these products to piggyback on. &ldquo;We have real depth in the market with our store network. This gives us an easy route to bring in new products and expand our portfolio,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Harminder Sahni, founder, Wazir Advisors, a Gurgaon-based retail consultancy firm, feels that Woodland has stayed true to its original values, which has served the company well. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve managed to grow and yet not spread themselves too thin,&rdquo; says Sahni. Only time will tell if the new bets will pay off. For now, Singh has no plans to outgrow the office building that has seen the brand prosper. &ldquo;We have become very comfortable in this zone,&rdquo; he says. That may change when competition comes knocking, but for now Singh is happy staying in the woods. <span class="s1"><br /></span></p>', 'Armed with innovative products and brand extentions in niche adventure and outdoors categories, Harkirat Singh wants consumers to see Woodland in a new light', '19', '', 0, '', 'the-big-kick-off-124', 119, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'The big kick-off', 'Armed with innovative products and brand extenstions in niche adventure and outdoors categories, Harkirat Singh wants consumers to see Woodland in a new light', '', '', '', 'Woodland,Harkirat Singh,Adventure sports,Decathlon,Quechua,Timberland,RECCO', 0, NULL, '2015-01-17 20:20:37', '2015-01-17 20:55:23', '2014-06-21', 0),
(125, 16, '', 'Cold comfort', '<p class="p1"><span class="s1">K</span>areena Kapoor says she&rsquo;s been a fan since she was 16. She isn&rsquo;t the only one &mdash; every year, Unilever sells over 1 billion sticks of Magnum ice cream that account for 2% of the parent firm&rsquo;s global revenue. It has taken a while for the Dutch MNC to bring Magnum, the world&rsquo;s largest selling ice cream, to India. Magnum was introduced in Europe over 20 years ago and yet is taking a slow approach to the launch. Hindustan Unilever (HUL), the second-biggest ice cream brand after Amul, soft launched Magnum in Chennai during April 2013. Only now it is seeking a national rollout for the ice cream, albeit with Kapoor as its brand ambassador. It is now available in four more cities &mdash; Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad and Bengaluru. The larger question, though, is: will Indians warm up to the idea of paying #85 for a cold dessert bought from a <em>kirana</em> store?</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>Hot and cold</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Currently, Magnum is by far the most expensive mass-market ice cream available in India. Available in three flavours, it is priced at Rs 85 for a 90-ml stick compared with Rs 45 for a Cornetto, also owned by HUL. Unilever is taking a mixed approach of exclusive and mass to push the product; it&rsquo;s available at your neighbourhood grocery store, but is stored in branded freezers provided by the company. And like other premium ice cream brands available in India, such as Haagen-Dazs and London Dairy, Magnum is imported (from Thailand) and not manufactured in India. The thinking behind the launch is pretty straightforward. Per capita ice cream consumption in India is still minuscule, just 250 ml a year, compared with 2 litre in China and over 20 litre a year in the US. Moreover, as discretionary income increases, consumers across the board are showing a willingness to switch to premium offerings in most products and there is no reason to suppose ice cream would be any different. &ldquo;There are enough opportunities to increase the consumption at both the affordable and premium end of the market,&rdquo; thinks Sapan Sharma, general manager (ice cream), Hindustan Unilever.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Big scoop and Pecking order- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">That&rsquo;s the glass half full view. Look at it another way and the premium end of the market accounts for only 10% of the Rs 3,620 crore ice cream industry, according to Euromonitor. Of course, this is a growth of more than two-and-a-half times over the Rs 1,452 crore registered in 2008, when premium brands accounted for 5% of the market. But Subroto Mukherjee, former COO (SAARC region) at Baskin Robbins and now CEO of Foodplus, which runs gourmet burger restaurant chain Burgs, maintains HUL will find the going difficult. &ldquo;If Magnum has to work, it should be widely available in hypermarkets and large supermarkets, where many shoppers come and inducing trials is possible. Selling it in smaller formats will not work since there is very little commitment from the shop owner,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p5">The decision to import rather than manufacture the ice cream at home may also work against Magnum. &ldquo;This can eat into gross margins and that is where companies with local manufacturing score,&rdquo; Mukherjee explains. Already, retailers are cribbing about the 15% gross margin HUL is offering on the dessert. &ldquo;Once you knock off power costs, it leaves us with barely 10%,&rdquo; says a store-owner who sells about 10-12 Magnum sticks a day in central Mumbai. That is about as much as he makes on Wall&rsquo;s, a more prominent and affordable HUL brand.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>Pricing it safe</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">While customers do seem willing to fork out #53 for a single scoop of Baskin Robbins ice cream and Rs 200 for a cup at Haagen-Dazs, remember they are paying for the experience as well as the ice cream. These offerings are still far behind regular brands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">Premium offerings, on their own, have been slow to pick up and haven&rsquo;t managed to keep up with more affordable brands such as Amul, which accounts for almost 40% of the market and is growing by 15-20% each year. RS Sodhi, the company&rsquo;s managing director, categorically says a premium ice cream will not have it easy in this market. Price will be a major turnoff, he points out. That is the reason why Amul&rsquo;s new premium offering, Cr&egrave;me Rich, launched this summer, is priced at just Rs 45. That&rsquo;s Rs 10 more expensive as Amul&rsquo;s next costliest offering, the Rs 35 pista-flavoured cone, but &ldquo;it is less than half Magnum&rsquo;s price and that too for 120 ml,&rdquo; points out Sodhi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">Indeed, other players offering premium products for the mass market are cautious when it comes to pricing. London Dairy, also sold through the <em>kirana</em> and modern trade route, is priced at just Rs 60 for a 75-ml bar. Domestic brand Creambell has ice cream cakes for Rs 375 for a 1 litre tub. &ldquo;This helps us offer a composite product portfolio across price points. But it is not easy to sell just premium ice creams in India,&rdquo; says Nitin Arora, CEO, Devyani Food Industries, which owns the Rs 400-crore Creambell brand.</p>\n<p class="p5">Sodhi believes a premium offering can work only when the quality is substantially better than existing products. But that isn&rsquo;t the case in India, he points out. &ldquo;Domestic players already offer good products at affordable prices.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p5">In cities where it is available, HUL has been on a marketing overdrive with promotional material for the brand plastering bus shelters and <em>kirana</em> stores. The focus in all these is on the unique customer and product experience. &ldquo;We have cracked a unique combination of reaching consumers through alternate non-TV media,&rdquo; says HUL&rsquo;s Sharma. &ldquo;Our focus is on growing the market and consumption of the category. We are doing so by offering exciting options to consumers through Indian as well as international flavours.&rdquo; Whether the outcome is as exciting for HUL will be evident soon.&nbsp;</p>', 'HUL''s expensive ice cream offering is unlikely to eat into its rivals'' market share', '7', '', 0, '', 'cold-comfort-125', 120, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Cold comfort', 'HUL''s expensive ice cream offering is unlikely to eat into its rivals'' market share', '', '', '', 'Hindustan Unilever,Magnum,Cornetto,Haagen-Dazs,London Dairy,Wall''s,Amul,Baskin Robbins,Creme Rich,Creambell', 0, NULL, '2015-01-17 21:06:47', '2015-01-19 11:48:31', '2014-06-21', 0),

That business is booming can be evinced by the fact that this single gas pump sells over 360,000 kg of compressed natural gas (CNG) in a month, compared with the national average of 125,000-130,000 kg a month for petrol or diesel pumps. &ldquo;The demand for CNG has been on the rise of late,&rdquo; points out Goswami. The spiralling prices of petrol and diesel in the recent past have created a whopping 86% differential between CNG and petrol (Rs 71.41 in Delhi) and an equally significant 50% differential between CNG and diesel (Rs 53 in Delhi), leading to wallet-conscious consumers switching over to fuel-efficient cars driven by CNG. In fact, last month, Maruti unveiled its latest CNG version of the Celerio, boasting of delivering best-in-class fuel efficiency of 31.79 km/kg. The launch follows Tata Motors&rsquo; attempt to woo customers with a CNG version of its small car, Nano, in late 2013. Though the overall automobile industry has been going through a slowdown, car-makers are churning out CNG variants to keep pulling in customers. More importantly, at Rs 1.61/km, the running cost of a CNG vehicle is the lowest, compared with Rs 4.45/km for petrol, and a little over a fifth cheaper than a diesel vehicle.</p>\n<p class="p3">And that can only be good news for Indraprastha Gas (IGL), the natural gas provider that owes its existence to a Supreme Court directive in 1998 that ordered the Delhi government to set up a gas distribution network for consumers and industries in the National Capital Region (NCR). The state government then tied up with GAIL India, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and a few other institutional investors to create IGL. It started small with just nine CNG stations and 1,000 piped natural gas (PNG) consumers. Today, it provides CNG to Delhi and the adjoining satellite towns of Noida and Gurgaon through a network of 324 filling stations and PNG to more than 450,000 households and 1,382 industrial and commercial users. More importantly, given that about 5,000 new Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses, along with 15,000 autorickshaws running on CNG will be inducted over the next two years, CNG volumes are expected to go up. Private vehicle owners too are keen on switching to CNG, what with diesel prices being deregulated and the gap between the two increasing. &ldquo;Of 20 lakh diesel and petrol vehicles, so far only 4.75 lakh have converted to CNG. So the scope for conversion is huge,&rdquo; points out Rajesh Chaturvedi, director, commercial, IGL. Not surprisingly, over the past five years, revenues and profits have shown 32% and 11% CAGR. How has IGL grown so well so soon? Can it keep up the momentum?</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Pumped up</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">What has proved a shot in the arm for IGL over a five-year period has been the rapid expansion in its PNG business. While growth in CNG has been steady from 605 million metric standard cubic metre (mmscm) in FY09 to 1,006 mmscm in FY13 at a CAGR of 15%, it is the PNG segment that has seen spectacular growth, from 54 mmscm in FY09 to 333 mmscm in FY13 &mdash; a CAGR growth of 51%. Similarly, while the number of CNG stations has doubled from 181 in FY09 to 324 in FY13 due to an increase in vehicular demand by 25%, over the same period, the real growth has seen the near tripling of PNG users from 138,332 in FY09 to 388,078 in FY13 and a corresponding increase in the steel and medium-density polyethylene (MDPE) pipeline network by 42%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>The heft is showing- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Not surprising, then, that in the recent quarter, IGL added 75 new PNG commercial connections and 15,000 domestic ones. However, in terms of absolute sales volumes, at 75% of total sales turnover, CNG remains IGL&rsquo;s bread and butter. For the longest time, IGL&rsquo;s focus was only on the NCR, given its exclusive monopoly in the region. But that monopoly ended in December 2011 and the firm has since been eyeing new pastures elsewhere. With the objective of expanding its presence outside the NCR, the company recently acquired a 50% equity stake in Central UP Gas (CUGL), a Kanpur- and Bareilly-based gas company, for Rs 69 crore, to be funded entirely through internal accruals. Financially, the move is a sound one as CUGL is a debt-free entity and can meet its capex funding requirements without any support from its new parent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">That isn&rsquo;t the only step IGL has taken to grow beyond Delhi. Inorganic growth could be one avenue for expansion, with smaller private independent players such as Maharashtra Natural Gas, Avantika Gas and Bhagyanagar Gas seen as potential targets. &ldquo;While we will continue to expand IGL&rsquo;s infrastructure in Delhi and NCR, we are also looking forward to entering new geographies through the bidding route and through strategic acquisitions,&rdquo; points out Narendra Kumar, MD. In fact, the PSU is in the process of evaluating a few other companies. &ldquo;Hopefully, these [buyouts] should materialise by the end of this fiscal,&rdquo; adds Chaturvedi. Organic growth, too, remains an option, with 14 cities &mdash; including Ernakulam, Bengaluru, Pune, Amritsar and Panipat &mdash; identified by the industry regulator Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (P&amp;NGRB) for expanding city gas reach. IGL is planning to bid for some cities and plans to fund the same through a combination of external borrowings as well as internal accruals. But while the company is on an expansion spree, it is also facing some headwinds.</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>Feeling the blues</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The P&amp;NGRB in 2012 had directed IGL to reduce its network and compression tariffs by 60%. Network tariffs are the charges levied by city gas companies to recover costs incurred for laying pipelines from the source of gas from state to state and within the city from one CNG station to another. Compression tariffs are charges levied by these companies for use of specialised machinery to compress natural gas into CNG. In addition, companies charge a marketing margin to recover their investment and bear the liquefied natural gas (LNG) spot price currency risk. IGL was continuously increasing all the three charges, which the regulator felt were excessive. In a non-commoditised business such as gas, compression and network tariffs make up the bulk of the margins so, not surprisingly, IGL appealed against this directive in the Delhi high court and won. Subsequently, P&amp;NGRB appealed against this decision in the Supreme Court and the matter is sub judice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The second litigation is a dispute between IGL and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on rent rates for leased land. In FY06 and FY08, IGL had acquired land from the DDA for setting up 60 CNG stations and signed a lease agreement with a 6% minimum escalation clause. However, in Q2FY14, the DDA hiked the rent for this land by a factor of 10 without prior notice, insisting on a retrospective hike in rent with effect from 2007. This matter is pending in the Delhi high court. The management is hopeful of a verdict in its favour since it is already paying the agreed upon escalation cost.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Gas trouble- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The other issue is the company&rsquo;s increasing reliance on external supply of gas &mdash; in this case, higher-priced imported LNG &mdash; despite the government allocating higher domestic gas output to players such as IGL. Though city gas distribution companies in Gujarat such as Gujarat Gas, GSPC and Adani Gas cut rates by 30% in February 2014, IGL was forced to raise CNG rates to Rs 38 per kg from the earlier Rs 35 per kg as it received only 80% domestic gas allocation against the mandated 100%. To make up for the shortfall, it had to resort to importing costlier rarified LNG (<em>see: Gas trouble</em>). While imported LNG is priced at $18 mmbtu, domestic gas, under the administered pricing mechanism, is significantly cheaper at $4.2 mmbtu. As a result, margins have been trending down. (<em>see: Feeling the pinch</em>).</p>\n<p class="p3">For the just-concluded fiscal, IGL posted a 2% growth in net profit, to Rs 360 crore, while turnover increased 16% to Rs 4,328 crore. The average daily gas sale during the year was up to 3.79 million metric standard cubic metre per day (mmscmd) from 3.67 mmscmd in the previous year. CNG realisation has improved significantly owing to three price hikes in June, September and December 2013. PNG volumes, on the other hand, have been muted, thanks to a slowdown in demand from industrial customers due to a price differential in Q4FY13 between LNG spot prices, which were at $20 mmbtu, and furnace oil, which was priced at $18 mmbtu. Furnace oil is an alternative replacement fuel derived from crude oil, often preferred by industrial users as the sales tax on it is only 4%, compared with 26% on PNG. &ldquo;Industrial demand was affected by a switch to alternative fuels. Current LNG spot prices of $19/mmbtu make it further unviable,&rdquo; points out Niraj Mansingka, analyst at Edelweiss Financial Services. Though the potential customer base for industrial PNG users in the Noida and Ghaziabad region is 2 million, IGL is serving just 0.5 million customers. It is lobbying hard with the UP government to bring furnace oil taxes at par with that of PNG. If that were to happen, then PNG volumes could see a significant uptick.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Feeling the pinch- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Though the marketing exclusivity for IGL in the NCR ended in 2011, till date, not a single player has expressed intent to enter the region. Besides, the regulator is yet to develop a policy framework for new entrants. Meanwhile, IGL has signed agreements with oil and marketing companies (OMCs) &mdash; which also pose a threat to its existence &mdash; for setting up CNG infrastructure in the 150 stations run by them. It also signed agreements with DTC for supplying CNG to it till 2020. All of these moves, the management feels, will help IGL safeguard its turf from rivals.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>When the going gets tough</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Going forward, volumes in the CNG segment are expected to improve owing to higher conversion of diesel and petrol consumers. With diesel prices being deregulated in a phased manner, the price of diesel may be hiked to Rs 62 per litre, compared with Rs 38 per kg of CNG in the NCR, making it an attractive switch. &ldquo;If the government reduces sales tax and excise duty and sets up CNG infrastructure pan India, it will greatly enhance conversions of automobile users to CNG,&rdquo; points out Dhananjay Sinha of Emkay Research. Currently, excise duty on diesel and petrol stands at a mere 6.5% and 13.1%, compared with 14.4% excise duty in case of CNG.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Volumes will also get a fillip from the addition of 5,000 CNG buses under the cluster, integrated multi-modal transport scheme and 15,000 new autorickshaws. &ldquo;The use of CNG has already been mandated in all forms of public transport vehicles operating in the national capital. All additions in the public transport fleet by the government and autos would add to CNG volumes,&rdquo; adds Kumar. As far as PNG volumes are concerned, the industrial segment could revive thanks to a sharp correction in spot LNG prices. Moreover, on the anvil is a proposed move to bring natural gas under the declared goods status that would lower sales tax on natural gas to 4% from the current 0-25% across various states. Sinha believes the rationalisation of duties and taxes will help in the future. &ldquo;Eventually, the APM mechanism will be dismantled and the pricing will become market-driven,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Hope floats- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Ongoing legal battles aside, IGL has a few factors in its favour. The barriers to entry for a competitor looking to replicate its success are many. &ldquo;It has an unbeatable first-mover advantage in the NCR, with maximum market share and an unmatched distribution network,&rdquo; says Sinha. And while the marketing exclusivity has ended, IGL&rsquo;s infrastructure exclusivity continues &mdash; what that means is that in order to recover the high cost of setting up the infrastructure, whose life is 30 years, IGL has exclusive usage of the same, which it would otherwise have had to share with new entrants. Then, having GAIL and BPCL as promoters means that it has access to low-priced gas, although it does import 45% of its gas requirements. Other players may not have access to gas at such competitive rates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The stock, which managed to dish out just 7% return in 2013 and is up 23% since the year began, is currently trading at 10 times estimated FY15 earnings. Against such a backdrop, betting on an upside in IGL far outweighs the risk on the downside.&nbsp;</p>', 'Enough potential for higher growth and attractive valuations make IGL a good bet', '11', '', 0, '', 'stepping-on-the-gas-127', 122, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Stepping on the gas', 'Enough potential for higher growth and attractive valuations make IGL a good bet', '', '', '', 'Indraprastha Gas,CNG,Petrol,Diesel,Bharat Petroleum Corporation,GAIL India,PNG,Central UP Gas', 0, NULL, '2015-01-19 11:55:57', '2015-01-19 12:17:28', '2014-06-21', 0),

It was almost a religious experience for me,&rdquo; says the joint managing director and executive director of <span class="s1">K</span>otak Mahindra Bank. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Not surprising when you consider that the 58-year-old grew up in Kerala, which he calls the nursery for football in India. He remembers watching several key football tournaments in north Kerala. Like other boys his age, Jayaram too grew up playing for his school. &ldquo;I have always participated in all kinds of sports, playing for my school and then Loyola College, and serving as sports secretary at IIM Calcutta.

I have vivid memories of the match, including GR Viswanath&rsquo;s 97 (not out) inning.&rdquo; Such obsession has taken him from watching the cricket World Cup live to partaking in strawberries and cream at Wimbledon. &ldquo;Though I didn&rsquo;t have time for Rio this year, I&rsquo;m going to try my best to attend the next world cup,&rdquo; adds Jayaram.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With his own tennis game getting competitive as the years progressed, Jayaram graduated to representing the Bandra Gymkhana in the prestigious inter-club Belani Shield Lawn Tennis Tournament. &ldquo;Of course, the standard of the players is quite high, and we almost never made it past the initial rounds, but I enjoyed participating.&rdquo; Especially since his partner was his own son. &ldquo;I really enjoyed the father-son bonding that the games afforded us.

(130, 24, '', 'Turning over a new leaf', '<p class="p1">Ever since it was first set up in Assam&rsquo;s Nazira in 1839, the story of Indian tea has been as thrilling as France&rsquo;s champagne and wine industry, linked with its own unique terroir. That romance, though, has only become evident in the decades. For most Indians, tea &ndash; when they know something about it &ndash; is limited to CTC and leaf, Assam or Nilgiri, but a new breed of tea-drinkers is treating it with the same passion as is deserving of sauvignon blanc grapes or Scotland&rsquo;s highland water. Masala chai may have its devotees &ndash; make that all of India &ndash; but an evolving palate is now demanding different varieties that not only have a heritage but also specific aromas and serving traditions that pamper the connoisseur of the finer things in life.</p>\n<p class="p3">Now, a book by photographer Rajan Kapoor and author Rekha Sarin (Chai, The Experience of Indian Tea, published by Niyogi Books, Rs 2,495) translates some of that romance into a heady experience that guides you through the full-bodied liquor of the Camellia Assamica bush with its &ldquo;coppery&rdquo; tones and &ldquo;rich and malty&rdquo; flavour &ndash; terms most people associate with wine and scotch rather than our humble tea. And just like those beverages, rainfall, sun and shade are variables that affect the complexities of the leaf. Assam&rsquo;s first flush, for instance, picked during early spring, results in a strong flavour that lingers long after the tea has been drunk. The second flush leaves lend a more mature and cleaner taste with a dark red infusion. And the autumnal flush comes with diluted flavours, making it ideal for blends.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Neighbouring West Bengal&rsquo;s Darjeeling is India&rsquo;s finest tea-growing region and its GI is part of the global lexicon. Unlike its counterparts from Assam, Darjeeling tea leaves are delicate in everything from colour to flavour to aroma. Given the long and extremely cold winter, the first flush Darjeelings are among the most highly regarded tea varieties in the world, and end up being mostly exported, while second flush Darjeeling tea is more easily found in specialty tea stores in the country. But a unique quality is its Muscatel, a tea that is plucked after green flies &ldquo;bruise&rdquo; the leaves, releasing an enzyme that reduces the water content in the plant, resulting in a full bouquet that monsoonal and autumnal flushes lack. Its finite quality makes it highly coveted. At Makaibari Tea Estate in Kurseong, the &ldquo;white&rdquo; tea is so cherished; it is the first pick among connoisseurs. Much more robust is Dooars tea that grows in the plains belt between Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">South Indians may prefer coffee but it isn&rsquo;t for lack of choices of tea. The Nilgiri tea from Ooty and Coonoor is well known, but the hills that run from Tamil Nadu to Kerala also have tea estates in the Anamalais and Wayanad. Few associate Kerala with tea, though those of Munnar and Coorg are at least somewhat known as compared to those of Idukki and Chikmagalur. Given the tropical climate, the variations in elevation, climate and soil, Nilgiri &ndash; though that appellate is limiting &ndash; tea tends to have great variety. But northern tea varieties are even lesser known. How many even imagine that tea grows in the Kangra valley &ndash; this writer has visited estates in Dharamsala and Palampur in Himachal Pradesh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Tea-tasters, auctions, blends&hellip;gardens, estates, planter&rsquo;s bungalows, clubs &ndash; like so much else, the world of tea is an inheritance of the British Raj and is imbued with colonial tales. Tea varieties come with their own vocabulary of multiplicities of pekoe, souchong (a Chinese favourite), broken leaf, fanning and dust. As urban India converts to a discovery of green tea (with oolong and yellow tea being other choices), tea-drinking habits are changing. The formal tea tray with its pot and cosy may be part of a formal world, and the &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; tea that caters to mass India may be considered downmarket by the cognoscenti, but there is no one way to enjoy your tea.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Discussions about the addition of milk (cold or warm) to tea liquor now generate the same fractious debate as soda, water and ice (and exactly how much ice) in the case of whisky, with the same unhappy conclusion that taste is individual and must override convention.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">As sophisticated tea drinkers replace milk with lemon or eschew any additives, even sugar, it&rsquo;s time to move beyond the store-packaged teas to infusions (including those that contain no tea whatsoever) that is an acquired taste which may prove to be addictive.

(131, 24, '', 'Putting data to work', '<p class="p1">Leadership is a critical factor in the success of traditional analytics programs, and it&rsquo;s just as important for big data. We don&rsquo;t have a lot of examples of leaders of companies with substantial commitments to big data&hellip; However, we can begin to make some generalisations about the approaches followed by these relatively few big data leaders... One key leadership trait for big data seems to be a willingness to sponsor experimental activity with data on a large scale. Big data, at least today, requires some educated faith. ROI is difficult to define in advance &mdash; particularly when it involves new products and services or faster decisions. This is especially true in the discovery phase.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There are some leaders who are willing to venture into big data on faith, however. At LinkedIn, for example, co-founder Reid Hoffman had also been a founder of PayPal, and knew there were substantial opportunities from exploiting online transaction data. It was primarily his decision to begin hiring data scientists into the product engineering organisation. He encouraged them not only to try to develop new products and services, but also to contact him directly if their ideas got stuck in the process or the hierarchy.</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s exactly what Jonathan Goldman, a data scientist at LinkedIn whom Hoffman had helped recruit, did when he had an idea for a new application that became People You May Know (PYMK). The application recommends people you may want to network with who have background attributes in common with you. Goldman created an early prototype of PYMK, but had difficulty getting the product engineering organisation to incorporate it into the LinkedIn site... Hoffman allowed him to create a test ad on the LinkedIn site.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The click-through rate on those ads was the highest ever seen. Goldman continued to refine how the suggestions were generated, incorporating networking ideas such as triangle closing &mdash; the notion that if you know Larry and Sue, there&rsquo;s a good chance that Larry and Sue know each other. Goldman and his team also got the action required to respond to a suggestion down to one click.</p>\n<p class="p3">LinkedIn&rsquo;s top managers quickly made PYMK a standard feature. That&rsquo;s when things really took off&hellip; PMYK messages achieved a click-through rate 30% higher than the rate obtained by other prompts to get people to return to the site. Millions of people paid repeat visits who would not have done so otherwise. Thanks to this feature, LinkedIn&rsquo;s growth trajectory shifted significantly upward... It wouldn&rsquo;t have happened without Goldman&rsquo;s idea &mdash; and Hoffman&rsquo;s support of it.</p>\n<p class="p3">It won&rsquo;t be necessary for data scientists to go directly to the company&rsquo;s chairman, but it&rsquo;s not a bad idea for senior executives to open a direct channel to them in the early days of the big data era. Part of taking an interest in experimentation is eliminating barriers to the implementation of innovative ideas and offerings.</p>\n<p class="p3">Leaders of big data-intensive organisations also need some degree of patience. A good deal of &ldquo;mucking around in data&rdquo; may be necessary before there is any sense of a payoff. It may even be necessary to keep data around for multiple years before its value is known. Jeff Bezos of Amazon is known for saying, &ldquo;We never throw away data,&rdquo; simply because it is difficult to know when it may become important for a product or service down the road.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Insights</strong></span></p>\n<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Wringing Amazon dry</strong></span></p>\n<p class="p1">Despite online retail transactions being all the rage in present times, a <br /> report by economists at the Ohio University spells doom for e-retailers in the US, especially global giant Amazon.

(134, 12, '', 'The intelligent restaurant', '<p class="p1">As a child, Satish Chamyvelumani was a frequent traveller on buses within Tamil Nadu. He enjoyed these trips with his family, but recalls the constant struggle to get food. Even a couple of decades later, when visiting his hometown Coimbatore on trips from the US, where he moved in 2000 as a student, Chamyvelumani and his family would not eat on the train, worried about the hygiene factor. That was his aha moment. If he could make available good food from trusted sources, he would not only be solving a pesky problem for hordes of travellers from India, but also creating a neat business opportunity for himself.</p>\n<p class="p3">And not just a meal or two. The idea was to offer people multiple options of hygienic, tasty meals and in a process where speed would be of essence. This last insight, says 36-year-old Chamyvelumani, was based on his own experience. &ldquo;I am one of those passengers who reach in the nick of time, just before the train pulls out of the station or the bus starts, so it was imperative that people shouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with a lengthy ordering process.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">The result of that deliberation was the launch in Chennai in May 2013 of the first Foodbox by Atchayam Business Solutions, the firm Chamyvelumani set up to implement his solution. An automated restaurant that at the press of a button, serves hot, pre-packaged meals from well-known eateries, there are now two outlets in operation in Chennai, together serving close to 400-450 meals a day. By 2015, Chamyvelumani aims to set up six more across Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>A quick bite</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">When Chamyvelumani set out with his idea, he knew technology would form the backbone of the venture and counted on his engineering background and experience as project manager at 3M to help. But that&rsquo;s when he discovered that the technology he sought didn&rsquo;t exist. It took the next three years for him to develop the technology and give concrete shape to the concept. In 2011, he roped in Ramesh Narayanan, a chartered accountant he had met through common friends, to oversee the operations in India while he remained in the US. The following year, Chamyvelumani moved back, lock, stock and barrel, ready to dive into Foodbox full-time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The location of outlets and partner restaurants is a key part of the Foodbox business model. While the first was set up at the DLF IT Park, the second is at Koyambedu, Chennai&rsquo;s busiest bus terminal. Atchayam&rsquo;s Foodbox has also tied up with well-known local restaurants, including Adyar Ananda Bhavan, Aasife Biriyani, Moti Mahal, Amaravathi, Kaaraikudi and Mr Chow''s, for different meal and snack options to make up the menu. &ldquo;The customer response has been very good. It works well for us because we are increasing our sales without additional investments,&rdquo; says KT Srinivasa Raja, managing director, Adyar Ananda Bhavan. &ldquo;As the awareness about Foodbox increases, Atchayam should be able to scale operations significantly, bringing down costs even lower in the next couple of years.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Foodbox Images (2)&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">So, how does the team&rsquo;s innovative machine work? After a customer chooses the meal from the touch screen and pays for it, the barcode inside the machine matches the right food tray with the order. It then travels on an automated conveyor belt where a device pierces holes on the cover of the tray, after which it goes into a microwave and comes out on the same belt piping hot. All this, in under 90 seconds. &ldquo;Many people think this is a vending machine. But it is nothing like that. Rather, this is an intelligent restaurant,&rdquo; says Chamyvelumani.</p>\n<p class="p3">The meals come in packed trays from the respective restaurants and are stored at the back of the climate-controlled machine. At one go, the Foodbox can store up to 225 meals and can be restocked hourly. &ldquo;We have an online monitoring system that sends alerts when stocks are low and keeps a watch on when the food is packed,&rdquo; says Rajasekaran Mathuram, CTO. &ldquo;Though the food trays come with an eight-hour expiry, we don&rsquo;t serve them if they have been with us for more than six hours.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We have an online monitoring system that sends alerts when stocks are low and keeps a watch on when food is packed" - Rajasekaran Mathuram, CTO, Foodbox</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Unbought food goes back to the restaurants; they bear the food cost while Atchayam is responsible for transport and packaging. Other expenses include rental for the location and the cost of the machine. Its revenue: a share on every sold meal. The average ticket size of a meal is Rs 130, of which Atchayam gets Rs 40 as facilitation fee.&nbsp;That doesn&rsquo;t sound like much but the potential is immense, says Chamyvelumani.</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>Serving it hot</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The firm is looking at IT parks and corporate offices, train and bus stations and high footfall areas such as food courts in shopping malls as possible locations to set up outlets. Atchayam has already tied up with online ticketing portal Ticket Goose, where customers can order food online and have it delivered to their seats. &ldquo;We offer customers the same comfort that airline passengers have, of choosing from the menu and getting a hot meal at their seats,&rdquo; says Ramesh Narayanan, CFO. The firm is also in talks with the railways to set up its next Foodbox at Chennai Central. &ldquo;We are also looking to take the machine to trade shows and exhibitions,&rdquo; says Chamyvelumani.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"We offer customers the comfort that airline passengers have, of choosing from the menu and getting hot meals at their seats" - Ramesh Narayanan, CFO, Foodbox</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Now, Atchayam is working on reducing the cost of its equipment, which will help it achieve break even faster. Currently, store break-even at the operating level takes six to 12 months, depending on location and size. While the first machine cost the firm nearly Rs 35 lakh to set up, it has since come down to Rs 14-15 lakh. The aim is to lower the cost further to Rs 10 lakh in the next year. Chamyvelamuni has also applied for a patent for the technology, both in India and overseas.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We see ourselves as facilitators for restaurant chains while solving an age-old problem of travelling families" - Satish Chamyvelumani, CEO, Foodbox</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">So far, Atchayam has raised Rs 4 crore in funding from family and friends and a private investor in the US. Now, it is looking for its next round of funding; over the next two years, it will invest Rs 4-6 crore to expand its presence, first across south India and then pan-India. That means reaching out to more cities and restaurants. &ldquo;We see ourselves as facilitators for restaurant chains while solving an age-old problem of travelling families,&rdquo; Chamyvelumani says. &nbsp;</p>', 'Atchayam''s Foodbox offers hot meals from well-known eateries to customers on the go — at the push of a button', '6', '', 0, '', 'the-intelligent-restaurant-134', 129, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'The intelligent restaurant', 'Atchayam''s Foodbox offers hot meals from well-known eateries to customers on the go — at the push of a button', '', '', '', 'Foodbox,Atchayam Business Solutions,Automated restaurant', 0, NULL, '2015-01-19 14:44:35', '2015-01-19 15:09:28', '2014-05-24', 0);

(135, 16, '', 'In an orbit of its own', '<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My children were thrilled when they heard I was joining a chocolate company,&rdquo; recalls MV Natarajan. Perhaps his 13-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son had images of Willy Wonka&rsquo;s chocolate factory in mind. From all accounts, the Mars manufacturing facilities in the US aren&rsquo;t far removed from that fictional candy plant (albeit, not as colourful) &mdash; giant vats of chocolate, sorting machines that automatically size, check and reject odd-shaped M&amp;M candy-coated </span>chocolates and, perhaps best of all, vending machines that give employees all the chocolate they want, all day long, all free. Mars International India is more staid in comparison &mdash; no factories, no vending machines &mdash; although Natarajan admits to keeping a stash of his favourite Galaxy bars on hand and sneaking a bite or three when he&rsquo;s alone. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay away from chocolate for too long,&rdquo; admits the head of the American confectionery giant&rsquo;s Indian arm. And his children are much the same, Natarajan adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">What gives him a bigger sugar rush is that his family isn&rsquo;t the only one with a sweet tooth &mdash; across India, craving for chocolate is on the rise. &ldquo;You will see a lot of action in the chocolate market soon,&rdquo; Natarajan predicts. &ldquo;It will be similar to what happened with the telecom or auto sectors in early 2000. The inflection point is approaching even as we speak.&rdquo; Which makes it even more surprising that Mars has made such a low-key entry into India: three years after it set up a wholly-owned subsidiary in India, it has formally launched only two brands, Snickers and Galaxy. Is this part of a deliberate strategy or has Mars India been knocked out of its orbit?</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Surprisingly slow</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The developed world seems to have had its fill of chocolate these past few years. Western markets aren&rsquo;t turning away from chocolate, but growth in those markets is decidedly sluggish, thanks to increasing concerns over obesity and lifestyle diseases. Shoppers, too, have become discerning: with chocolate becoming a treat once again, they prefer to spend a little more on artisan companies, unusual flavours and premium ingredients, rather than just pick up what&rsquo;s available at the supermarket.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">On the other hand, markets such as India seem to be only just peeling off the wrapper on their share. Indeed, India is believed to be the fastest-growing chocolate market in the world, clocking over 20% growth in the past five years, which has taken the market from 547,000 tonne in 2008 to 1,292,000 tonne in 2013 (<em>see: Very, very chocolate-y</em>). But it&rsquo;s still a small bite compared with others &mdash; per capita chocolate consumption in the UK is 10.2 kg a year and 5.6 kg in the US, whereas Indians still put away just 100 gm a year. Even that is dominated by one player &mdash; Cadbury, synonymous in India with chocolate, rules the category with 57% market share, followed by Nestl&eacute; (21%) and Ferrero Rocher (4.7%). (<em>see: Sweet nothings</em>)</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Very, very, chocolate-y- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">With growing disposable incomes and changing consumer tastes, chocolate looks set to become a part of regular consumption instead of a special occasion eat. And, as Natarajan happily points out, it&rsquo;s no longer only for children. &ldquo;If I were to rewind to before 2000, chocolate was considered a kids&rsquo; product. If an adult ate chocolate in public, he would almost be laughed at.&rdquo; Mars India&rsquo;s marketing director Raghav Rekhi points to another encouraging trend in the Indian market: &ldquo;The market isn&rsquo;t growing only because the same people are consuming more and more chocolate, but because more people are getting into the category every month.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Sweet nothings- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Why hasn&rsquo;t Mars brought out its heavy artillery to take on the established players in the market and quickly reproduce its global leadership here as well? The $33-billion, family-owned business, which has interests ranging from confectionery to pet food, has over 29 chocolate brands sold in 74 countries, including five that are billion-dollar global brands &mdash; Mars (called Milky Way in the US), Snickers, Galaxy (also called Dove), M&amp;M and Twix. This is in addition to the various gum, mint and hard candy brands it owns under Wrigley, a company it acquired in 2008 along with Warren Buffett&rsquo;s Berkshire Hathaway. Mars India, though, has a puny arsenal of just Snickers and Galaxy (launched only in November 2013), although Mars bar, Twix and Bounty are also available in metro markets. (Wrigley India is a separate company.) &ldquo;We could, hypothetically, launch more brands. But each brand is like a baby. You need to nurture it and do justice to it from the point of view of establishing brand credentials and ensuring its availability,&rdquo; Natarajan explains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The [chocolate] market is growing because more people are getting into the category every month" - Raghav Rekhi, director, marketing, Mars India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Just what does nurturing brands entail? At Mars India, it first means steering clear of playground fights with the big boys in the yard. Even though the two companies battle it out in developed markets such as Western Europe (the largest market for chocolate) and the US (the biggest consumer by volume), Natarajan is clear that Mars will not play David to Cadbury&rsquo;s Goliath in the Indian market, nor will it compete head-on with Nestl&eacute; and Ferrero Rocher (which is present in India with its iconic spherical hazelnut chocolate as well as Kinder Joy). So much so that he says he has set no market share target for Mars India. &ldquo;The objective is not to start with a market share. Our play will be to add and be a part of the category growth story in India. So market share will be a derivative of our efforts, not a starting point.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">He may not have &mdash; or may actually not be willing to disclose &mdash; market share targets, but Natarajan certainly has a deadline in mind: five years. &ldquo;We can be in the league of large players by 2019. We&rsquo;ve come to India with a long-term perspective,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">What will help, believes Natarajan, is that the chocolate market in India is not a zero-sum game, unlike in developed markets. It&rsquo;s not necessary to take a bite from anyone&rsquo;s share of the pie &mdash; the pie itself can be made larger, creating room for more players. &ldquo;In a situation where a reasonably large category of a billion dollars is growing upward of 20%, there&rsquo;s no need to look at it as a pie at all,&rdquo; he adds. And the trick behind making the market grow enough to accommodate everyone? Make chocolate more than an occasional indulgence.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Seeking satisfaction</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Relying on the rising tide to lift all boats seems a risky strategy, especially since the other players in the market are following aggressive growth plans of their own. Market leader Cadbury has been innovating over the past few years with smaller pack sizes and low-priced variants and recently launched 5-Star Chomp that will take Snickers head on, even as group company Toblerone brought out its iconic triangular bar. Cadbury was also the first to venture into the traditional <em>mithai</em> space with its Celebration range, a space new entrant Ferrero Rocher has also staked a claim to. The Italian brand has effectively straddled the two most active segments of the market &mdash; gifting among adults with the flagship hazelnut chocolate and children with Kinder Joy &mdash; that has led to it getting 4.7% of the market in a few short years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Mars, in contrast, still has just over 1% of the market, although Snickers has been around for several years now. Analysts believe that may have something to do with the positioning of the chocolate bar &mdash; not as a treat, but as a snack. In keeping with its global positioning, its chocolate is for &ldquo;anybody between 15 and 50 years&rdquo;, says Natarajan, but the target group is teenagers. Launched in the US in 1930 and named for a favourite horse of the Mars family, Snickers was initially promoted for its key ingredient &mdash; peanuts. By the 1970s, the communication moved to how the chocolate bar was all about satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">That positioning has stayed with the brand in India as well, where it aired its first full-length ad film in 2008. The Hindi tagline &ldquo;Hunger <em>bajaye char</em>, <em>toh</em> Snickers <em>khol yaar</em>&rdquo; made it pretty clear this was more than a chocolate: it was snack meant to satiate. This was followed by on-ground activations in major metros, aimed at young men in the 16 to 24 age group, involving team sports (tying in with the TVC, which featured a football match) as well as extensive sampling.</p>\n<p class="p3">Four years later, Mars returned to television with another TVC, this one following its global tagline of &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not you when you&rsquo;re hungry&rdquo;. The US ads, launched in 2010, had featured Betty White, Aretha Franklin and Liza Minelli. Similar campaigns ran in 55 countries around the world, and the Indian adaptation showed hungry cricketers transformed into tantrum-throwing drama queens (portrayed by Urmila Matondkar and Rekha in a casting coup), till they munch on a Snickers bar. The tagline was also duly adapted to &ldquo;Hunger <em>achhe achhon ko badal deta hai</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;This just goes to show that sensibilities and the pulse of the consumer is universal for a basic instinct such as hunger,&rdquo; says Navneet Virk, executive creative director, RK Swamy BBDO, Mars India&rsquo;s ad agency. Rekhi seconds that thought. &ldquo;The campaign has done more than its fair share of driving sales. We continue to leverage it even now,&rdquo; he says. Targeting students also means making the product available at places they are likely to frequent, which means retail stores as well as university canteens as well as having a presence on social media &mdash; the Snickers India Facebook page has 1.4 million &lsquo;likes&rsquo;.</p>\n<p class="p3">As brand positioning, Snickers as a snack certainly draws attention. But in a country that has a rich tradition and repertoire of snack foods &mdash; from <em>samosa</em>, <em>vada pav</em>, <em>dhokla</em> and <em>idli</em>, to sandwiches, frankies and <em>chaat</em>, will chocolate ever be a 4-o&rsquo;-clock food? Harminder Sahni, founder of retail consultancy Wazir Advisors, agrees. &ldquo;For Rs 15, a consumer can buy two <em>samosas</em> or, by adding another Rs 10, a McDonald&rsquo;s burger. I&rsquo;m not sure Indians buy chocolate for killing hunger. It continues to be super-discretionary spending and should be positioned as such.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Celebrities, used judiciously and intelligently, can help you break clutter. Rekha and Rampal had clear roles to play in the ads" - Navneet Virk, executive creative director, RK Swamy BBDO&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s exactly what Mars is doing with Galaxy. The moulded chocolate bar was formally launched last year with actor Arjun Rampal as brand ambassador. The ad shows Rampal playing himself and sharing the chocolate with a journalist who&rsquo;s waiting to interview him &mdash; the scene is one of pure self-indulgence, underlined by the tagline, &ldquo;<em>Reshmi ehsaas, resham se bhi khaas</em>&rdquo;. The Hindi tagline takes last year&rsquo;s international tagline &ldquo;Why have cotton when you can have silk?&rdquo; a step further and also makes a less-than-subtle dig at Cadbury&rsquo;s Silk chocolate &mdash; not that either company or ad agency acknowledge that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Celebrities, if used judiciously and intelligently, can help you break the clutter. Rekha and Arjun Rampal were not used simply to endorse our products. They had clear roles to play in the stories of Snickers and Galaxy as they complement the brand values. They also offered a surprise element,&rdquo; says Virk.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>The <em>desi</em> touch</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">If Mars has adopted its global advertising mandate in India as well, the company has shown more flexibility in its products for the local market. Prices have been kept deliberately low. Snickers was soft launched in 2004 at Rs 30 for a 54-gm pack, but is now available at a more affordable Rs 15 (25 gm) &mdash; it&rsquo;s also recently introduced Snickers miniatures, priced at Rs 99 for a 150-gm bag. Galaxy, too, has been launched at Rs 15. Rekhi points out that these are the cheapest chocolates by Mars in any market. &ldquo;These are products we innovated at Mars Inc specifically for India,&rdquo; he says. Interestingly, Mars India doesn&rsquo;t manufacture in India yet &mdash; the company is scouting for suitable land and should set up its plant in the country in the next 12-15 months, says Natarajan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But while it currently imports all of its products from Russia, Holland and Dubai, Mars has nevertheless made significant changes to suit local tastes. In end-2010, Mars launched a vegetarian version of Snickers, minus the eggs found in the original recipe. The &lsquo;green dot&rsquo; Snickers sells alongside the regular version, at the same price. &ldquo;In a country where one third of the population is vegetarian, it was critical to have vegetarian Snickers,&rdquo; says Natarajan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">And if you need proof that it is serious about not competing with Cadbury and Nestl&eacute;: Mars doesn&rsquo;t have a rural India strategy. &ldquo;Chocolates have gained popularity even in rural areas. You can see brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk Shots and Nestl&eacute; Munch priced at Rs 2 and Nestl&eacute; 5-star priced at Rs 5 in village <em>kirana</em> stores. These lower-priced versions compete with sugar confectionery brands that are priced at Re 1,&rdquo; says Ina Dawer, senior research analyst, Euromonitor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Indeed, villages with population over 10,000 are estimated to account for 5% of total chocolate sales in India and the market leaders have all drawn elaborate plans for increasing their penetration into the hinterland. Cadbury, for instance, wants to tap 75% of all villages with population under 5,000 by 2015.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In sharp contrast, Mars is available in just 100 cities and 100,000 outlets, with a focus on modern trade outlets. Its products are available in 3,000 supermarkets and hypermarket outlets across the country, many of which sport dedicated Snickers stalls. &ldquo;It brings us within arm&rsquo;s reach of the modern consumer,&rdquo; says Natarajan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Unlike other FMCG companies, Mars has its own network of distributors who reach out to retailers directly, visiting stores once a week. &ldquo;We want to ensure the quality of chocolate for the consumers, so we are dealing with retailers directly, investing in chilling infrastructure at <em>kirana</em> stores,&rdquo; Natarajan says. So far, Mars has supplied a significant number of chillers to small stores for free. The personal touch is a good idea on a small scale, but the strategy will be difficult to sustain once Mars finally steps out of the cities to expand across the country. And that should happen sooner, rather than later, warn industry observers. &ldquo;Cadbury is available at 10 times more places than Mars. Reach and availability can make or break the company at this stage,&rdquo; says Wazir&rsquo;s Sahni. Natarajan is non-committal. &ldquo;We are scanning the retail landscape in India,&rdquo; he says, declining to share details of expansion.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Cadbury is available at 10 times more places than Mars. Reach and availability can make or break the company at this stage" - Harminder Sahni, founder, Wazir Advisors</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The road ahead for Mars isn&rsquo;t going to be easy. It is a late entrant in a market where big players enjoy immense brand recall, deep distribution networks and have wide product portfolios to appeal to different customer groups. &ldquo;At a fundamental level, share has to be taken from traditional sweets and <em>mithaiwalas</em>, not so much other players. The challenge is to reach the right counter, to create the right kind of pull for its brands,&rdquo; says Sahni.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Natarajan, though, is optimistic. &ldquo;We are at the right place at the right time, at least,&rdquo; he says.

This buy comes at a time when sales of the company have been plummeting across segments in tune with the rest of the industry. Overall sales have plummeted from 114,611 units in FY13 to 89,342 units in FY14. Understandably, Dasari has taken the rap for this.

Following the travails of Mallya in the wake of the spectacular collapse of Kingfisher Airlines, MCF&rsquo;s rivals &mdash; the Saroj Poddar-owned Zuari Fertilizers &amp; Chemicals and Sailesh Mehta-owned Deepak Fertilisers &amp; Petrochemicals Corporation &mdash; built up sizeable stakes in the company, sensing an opportunity to buy it if and when Mallya chose to clear his outstanding dues on the airline.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">However, with Mallya not showing any intention of clearing his dues and his studied silence over the fate of his stake in the company, uncertainty was building around which way the scales would tilt for MCF. That is, until Mehta chose to go on the offensive.</p>\n<p class="p3">The Pune-based Deepak Fertilisers has made an unsolicited open offer to acquire up to 30.8 million shares, or 26%, in MCF at Rs 61.75 a share, entailing an outgo of Rs 190 crore. Deepak already owns a 24.46% stake in the company through its subsidiary SCM Soilfert. While Zuari Fertilisers holds 16.43% stake, Poddar has clearly indicated that he would not want to launch a hostile bid, preferring a negotiated deal with Mallya.</p>\n<p class="p3">Though Mallya holds close to 22% stake in MCF through four entities, United Breweries Holdings, United Spirits, McDowell Holdings and Kingfisher Finvest, more than half his holdings are pledged with institutions. Even as some media reports have indicated that both Mallya and Poddar are looking to raise their combined holding in the company from over 38% to 51%&nbsp;or that Poddar will bow out of the race by selling his stake to whoever offers the highest price, it is clear that Deepak Fertilisers is dead serious about the company.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Winner takes all- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">MCF makes for a strategic bet given its strong presence in Karnataka, while Deepak is strong in Maharashtra and Gujarat. Also, on the product front, MCF&rsquo;s urea presence will complement Deepak&rsquo;s product portfolio, which is largely focused on nitro phosphate fertilisers. Though his open offer price is 18% lower than the current rate of around Rs 73, given that Deepak is sitting on cash of over Rs 183 crore and leverage of less than 1 times, there is enough firepower for Mehta to dig his heels in the bidding war. Given his airlines fiasco, Mallya is unlikely to get funding from banks or institutions, which means he will have to rely on Poddar for an amicable solution.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With only 36% of floating stock in the market, Deepak Fertilisers&rsquo; chances of buying a full 26% from the open offer will hinge on how juicy the offer price is.

(138, 20, '', 'A glass act', '<p class="p1">In the dark days of pre-liberalised India, the style index of a middle class home in India was decided by, among several other things, its dinnerware. Stainless steel disqualified you before starting, almost everybody had bone china sets, but gleaming, nearly-unbreakable white glass plates and bowls got you bonus points &mdash; it meant you had access to &lsquo;imported&rsquo; stuff (relatives coming from the Gulf or the US would invariably bring back cardboard boxes of Corelle dinner sets). Then, in 1987, India got its own brand of milky white glass dinnerware, which, nearly a quarter century later, is still the market leader in the domestic opalware market. And despite the presence here of some of the world&rsquo;s best-known brands in the business, including Corelle, La Opala shows no signs of letting up.</p>\n<p class="p3">A planned visit to South Korea in 1985 introduced Kolkata&rsquo;s Sushil Kumar Jhunjhunwala to opalware, opaque or translucent glass made white with the addition of tin dioxide or bone ash. The eldest of several siblings in a family business of manufacturing recycled glass for hurricane lamps, glass chimneys, etc., he was intrigued by opalware&rsquo;s use in dinnerware. Convinced there would be a market for similar products in India, he returned home and in 1987 set up a plant at Madhupur, now in Jharkhand, to make opalware products for the domestic market. In 1991, La Opala ventured into overseas markets such as Singapore, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain, went public in 1995, and a year later, introduced Solitaire, a range of 24% lead crystal glassware in a tie-up with South Korea&rsquo;s Doosan Glass. Now, the Rs 180-crore company has a nearly 55% share of the Rs 300-crore, organised opalware market, ahead of overseas competitors such as RAK, Corelle and Luminarc. It has a wide distribution network of 125 distributors covering 10,000 retail outlets in 600 cities and towns across the country. The company also exports to markets such as the US, France and Italy &mdash; 90% of Solitaire&rsquo;s Rs 20-crore sales come from export.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Double fast- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">What&rsquo;s interesting in the La Opala story is that where it took nearly 12 years, from FY98 to FY09, to double turnover from Rs 30 crore to Rs 62 crore, in the past six years alone, the company has tripled topline from Rs 62 crore to Rs 180 crore in FY13 (<em>see: Double fast</em>). What explains this supercharged growth and can La Opala sustain this, going forward?</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Just fine</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">According to a Nirmal Bang report, the Indian crockery market, excluding stainless steel, was pegged at Rs 1,800 crore and broadly includes bone china, glassware, melamine, porcelain, opalware, crystalware and stoneware. More than half the industry is unorganised. The Rs 300-crore opalware market is dominated by players such as La Opala, Luminarc, Corelle, Bormioli Rocco, Treo, Year, JCPL and others. Where La Opala scores over the others is with its manufacturing facilities &mdash; the bulk of inventory of foreign companies such as Luminarc, Corelle and RAK is imported, whereas La Opala has manufactured in India from the start, keeping its costs low.</p>\n<p class="p3">Until six years ago, La Opala operated out of two semi-automated plants at Madhupur, in collaboration with its Korean partner. The plants have capacity of 4,000 tpa and 1,000 tpa and are operating at 90% capacity currently. In 2008, it set up a fully-automated 8,000 tpa manufacturing facility at Sitargunj, Uttaranchal. It was an audacious move for a Rs 55-crore company to invest Rs 40 crore in a plant, but Ajit Jhunjhunwala, joint managing director and Sushil Kumar&rsquo;s son, explains the rationale. &ldquo;Though we were growing at 12% a year, we found it difficult to scale up without a fully-automated process.&rdquo; The company approached US and Italian players for technology transfer but was &ldquo;stonewalled&rdquo;. So, it turned to furnace and machinery suppliers to overseas players and procured the know-how to set up its plant, &ldquo;allowing us to scale up in a big way&rdquo;.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Top-notch- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">It certainly did. Fully automated processes and a spinning process superior to the pressed process at Madhupur meant superior quality and 15% lower manufacturing costs, all of which made an impact on the P&amp;L. La Opala also used the opportunity to introduce Diva, a high quality brand with premium positioning, which proved a game changer &mdash; the brand now contributes 50% to total revenue. The lighter, thinner yet stronger product saw good traction in the market and its premium pricing trickled down to the company&rsquo;s bottomline &mdash; the Diva range starts at a 35% premium to La Opala.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It helps, also, that La Opala has substantially hiked its marketing spends. The Diva range has celebrity endorsements from actor Bipasha Basu and fashion designer Manish Malhotra and the company has upped its advertising and promotion budget from 4% of sales in 2008 to 12% currently to ensure it has high brand recall in a growing market. &ldquo;Our aggressive marketing efforts have helped grow the brand considerably. Today, if you go to a retail outlet, you will find that our products are the largest-selling brands even in the off season,&rdquo; says Jhunjhunwala.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Our aggressive marketing has helped grow the brand. Our products are the largest-selling brands even in the off season" - Ajit Jhunjhunwala, joint managing director, La Opala</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">External factors have played a role in La Opala&rsquo;s growth, too. In FY11, the government imposed an anti-dumping duty on cheap Chinese crockery imports. &ldquo;The anti-dumping duty has allowed La Opala to expand its moat,&rdquo; says Tejas Shah, consumer sector analyst, Spark Capital.</p>\n<p class="p3">Jhunjhunwala, though, doesn&rsquo;t believe it has been a major factor &mdash; &ldquo;Perhaps 10-15% of our success has come from this,&rdquo; he says &mdash; and adds that even if the duty were now revoked, it would have a negligible impact on La Opala since its cost of production is similar to Chinese players. At the same time, 90% of La Opala&rsquo;s sales come from opalware, which is priced 30% higher than Chinese imports, which are mainly bone china and porcelain products, which means his margins are higher.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"La Opala is not as expensive as the other foreign brands. So, it is both aspirational and affordable" - Tejas Shah, consumer sector analyst, Spark Capital</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Shah believes the changing nature of the market has also played a part in La Opala&rsquo;s superfast growth these past few years. &ldquo;Over the past few years, there has been a spurt in purchase of branded products across categories due to aspirational spending. Plus, La Opala is one of the few brands available in the tableware category. While the positioning is premium, it is not as expensive as the other foreign brands. So it is both an aspirational and affordable brand.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>A cut above</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Being the first and only established domestic player, La Opala enjoys a certain pricing power. In the past five years, the brand has seen three price hikes of around 4-7% each. Since its launch in 2009, the Diva brand has had two price increases, of around 5-8% each. That is giving the company the confidence to embark on capacity expansion at Sitargunj. The plant currently operates at 85% of its 8,000 tpa capacity and La Opala is looking to add 4,000 tpa capacity by end-FY15 at investment of Rs 40 crore to be funded equally by internal accruals and debt. The expansion at Sitargunj makes sense given that, going forward, the focus will be more on the Diva brand, which is manufactured here.</p>\n<p class="p3">Jhunjunwala is confident of La Opala&rsquo;s prospects in the years ahead. &ldquo;Rising aspirational spending will be the key trigger for growth. The market is at a very nascent stage in India; it can only grow from here on. We are targeting 20% growth annually and we think that is sustainable,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Profitable growth- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Certainly, the numbers for the past few years have been encouraging. While RoE jumped from 3% to 35% between FY08 and FY13, RoCE climbed from 6% to 40% (see: Profitable growth). &ldquo;In FY08, leverage was 2 times, which came down to 1.5 times in FY13. Asset turnover was 0.7 owing to the plant having just started. It is now at 1.6. PAT margin has also increased from 2% to 15%,&rdquo; points out Shah of Spark Capital, explaining the improvement in the return ratios.</p>\n<p class="p3">The growth hasn&rsquo;t been consistent, though. From a high of Rs 5 crore in FY07, post-tax profit dropped to Rs 1 crore in FY08, before increasing substantially to Rs 23 crore in FY13. Jhunjhunwala explains this was because of the high interest burden on account of the new plant. Shah adds other reasons: availability of power, high costs, lack of demand and the inability of scale up, at least initially.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Right now, at least, there are several positives going for La Opala. &ldquo;La Opala&rsquo;s revenue growth will remain strong in future,&rdquo; predicts Jignesh Kamani, research analyst at Nirmal Bang. &ldquo;They are still underpenetrated in several categories. They have a very strong distribution network, demand for their products is very robust and they have huge brand recall.&rdquo; He adds that margins, too, should be on the upswing since Diva has seen a 7% price hike in March.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Hence its Ebitda margin, which is at 29% in FY14, could increase by 6% in FY15.&rdquo; Moreover, La Opala is debt-free, so Kamani expects net profit to grow at 30% CAGR over the next three years.</p>\n<p class="p3">On the flip side, succession planning remains an issue as the company grows. Right now, all functions, from manufacturing to design and marketing and export, is managed by Jhunjhunwala. The company lacks a strong second tier management team to delegate, which will be a huge stumbling block as it grows to a topline of Rs 500 crore and more. &ldquo;As it scales up further, La Opala needs to find a competent and ambitious second tier of management to manage its affairs,&rdquo; confirms Kamani. With scale, devolution of responsibilities will be needed and how La Opala manages this may go a long way to deciding whether future growth will be smooth or not. Analysts also expect the removal of the anti-dumping duty, slated for 2017, to hurt revenue and margins, despite the company&rsquo;s claims that it will not. Nirmal Bang estimates that growth will moderate from 27.7% CAGR over FY10-FY13 to 21.5% CAGR over FY13-FY15.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"As it scales up, the firm needs to find a competent and ambitious second tier of management to handle work" - Jignesh Kamani, research analyst, Nirmal Bang Securities</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">For now, La Opala&rsquo;s valuations do not appear expensive, though they are higher than the seven-year average of seven times. At the current price of Rs 856, the stock is trading at 12 times estimated FY15 earnings. Owing to a healthy volume growth, improvement in return ratios and healthy cashflow generation, the debt-equity ratio is likely to come down further from 0.4 times in FY13 to 0.1 times in FY15. As long as the growth trajectory stays intact, this will be one dish that investors will savour for time to come.&nbsp;</p>', 'Kolkata-based La Opala is well-placed to capitalise on the rising consumer preference for premium crockery ', '11', '', 0, '', 'a-glass-act-138', 133, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'A glass act', 'Kolkata-based La Opala is well-placed to capitalise on the rising consumer preference for premium crockery ', '', '', '', 'Opalware,Corelle,La Opala,Solitaire,Luminarc,RAK,Diva', 0, NULL, '2015-01-19 16:05:40', '2015-01-19 16:28:11', '2014-05-24', 0),

At the end of the process, pleased with his labour, the 60-year-old chairman and CEO of Parag Parikh Financial Advisory Services dragged the pots to their final spots around the tiled terrace. Parikh was grateful for the light drizzle that followed, till the drizzle turned into a shower, which then turned into a four-day burst that not only drowned his newly planted pots but wrecked some of his other favourites as well. &ldquo;Nature, just like the markets, is extremely unpredictable.

If you sign up for its annual membership to receive a selection of wines every quarter, and curated offers in between, you&rsquo;ll know what I mean. Barely had a case of &ldquo;lovely refreshing whites&rdquo; been delivered when an e-mail offering &ldquo;summer favourites&rdquo; popped into the inbox. With a range that included a &ldquo;tangy&rdquo; Sauvignon Blanc from Chile, a &ldquo;juicy old-vine&rdquo; Minervois from France, a Semillon with &ldquo;aromas of plum and raspberry&rdquo; to another Chilean &ldquo;fantastically fresh and whistle clean&rdquo; Sauvignon, or a &ldquo;zippy&rdquo; Australian white with &ldquo;fruit and honeyed lemon notes&rdquo;, it made summer seem almost Mediterranean with the promise of al fresco wining and dining.</p>\n<p class="p3">The truth, of course, is that the Indian summer is harsh enough to scald. Even so, the thought of the light, fruity and cool contents of a bottle of summer wine &mdash; remember the song? &mdash; does hold appeal. Who wants <em>nimbupani</em> when you can have something with alcoholic spirits but with the scent of &ldquo;herbal mint and rosemary&rdquo;?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Many of us drink heavier alcoholic spirits even in the heat, but is it time to change? I can&rsquo;t imagine anything more tempting than a cool, refreshing glass of a reserve, whether from Nashik or Naples, paired with a light meal of lightly grilled prawns on a bed of bell pepper juliennes. Or an entire meal of bruschettas &mdash; crisp toast topped with tomatoes, crushed garlic and mint in extra virgin olive oil. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The kitchen is an unwelcome space in the summer so it&rsquo;s often easier to command the cook to serve up a full-course meal when all the palate needs is something simple and easily digestible. <em>Dal</em> and mutton <em>roganjosh</em> may be Indian staples, but surely there&rsquo;s reason to match the wines with spicier options than the heavy <em>masala</em> included in most Indian meals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Salads may seem too healthy, but they can be flavourful and zesty if you have the confidence to build them up with whatever ingredients you can find in the fridge. For me, the only must for a summer salad is feta cheese. Give me feta and I&rsquo;ll return you a gourmet salad no matter what you may or may not find in the kitchen. Toss together chunks of cucumber, onion, bell pepper, tomato, shredded leaves of lettuce, cabbage, mix with watermelon, orange, pear, apple, add chopped up bits of spring onion, walnut, cashew, roasted peanut and add a dressing of olive oil, mustard, salt, pepper, lemon juice or white vinegar. Mix feta cheese (or parmesan shavings). Bliss.

Cous-cous, wild rice, quinoa &mdash; add steamed vegetables, diced bell peppers, soya sauce and have yourself a meal with a lusty red from the cellars of Spain. But bear in mind that your Merlots and Bordeauxs need cooling, if not quite chilling like the whites, and will benefit from being decanted and allowed to breathe. If you&rsquo;re having company, pour the contents of your red in a flask a half-hour ahead and place it in a fridge. If you&rsquo;re serving white wine, keep the bottle in a bed of ice in a wine cooler like you would champagne &mdash; chilling in the fridge simply isn&rsquo;t enough.

According to Dylan Evans, who has written a book with the same title, &ldquo;it is the ability to estimate probabilities accurately... at the heart of risk intelligence lies the ability to gauge the limits of your own knowledge &mdash; to be cautious when you don&rsquo;t know much and to be confident when, by contrast, you know a lot.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">According to the author, risk intelligence can be developed significantly under the right conditions. He contrasts the term risk intelligence with risk appetite; where risk intelligence is a cognitive capacity, risk appetite is an emotional trait that explains how comfortable people are with taking risks. So, &ldquo;risk appetite governs how much risk you want to take, while risk intelligence involves being aware of how much you are taking&rdquo;. Some gamblers have high risk intelligence coupled with a high risk appetite, but most successful gamblers are risk neutral. A dangerous combination would be a high appetite for risk with low risk intelligence.</p>\n<p class="p3">Evans says that risk intelligence can be improved by repeatedly estimating the probabilities of a narrow range of events and getting feedback. He says that there are a number of psychological traits that inhibit risk intelligence &mdash; ambiguity intolerance (that is, reacting to ambiguity with feelings of uneasiness, discomfort, dislike, anger and anxiety that intrude on rational assessment); the need for psychological closure (the desire for an answer to a question &mdash; any answer, even the wrong one &mdash; rather than remaining in a state of confusion and ambiguity); the fallacy of worst-case thinking (transforming low-probability events into complete certainties whenever the events are particularly scary); the all-or-nothing fallacy (the tendency to think of proof, knowledge, belief in binary terms); behavioural finance heuristics such as the availability heuristic and wishful thinking (people with high risk intelligence see the world as it is, not the way they would like it to be).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In addition to this, there are several other common errors of judgement, such as optimism bias, confirmation bias, hindsight bias and the illusion of transparency (the assumption that others have the ability to read us more accurately than is the case).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The author believes that &ldquo;true risk intelligence involves a curious blend of rational numerical calculation and intuitive (epistemic) feelings in which neither is sufficient on its own&rdquo;. High risk intelligence depends upon 1) a well-calibrated epistemic feeling and 2) an ability to translate epistemic feelings into numbers. Resolution is the psychological word relevant here &mdash; how many probability ranges can we have in our epistemic thermometer?</p>\n<p class="p3">These concepts make the book well worth reading.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Insights</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">The glass ceiling hasn''t cracked yet</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1">There is news for those who still think of gender-based wage discrimination at the workplace as a relic of the post-war decades &mdash; new research shows that female managers still receive a fraction of their male counterparts&rsquo; pay. Researchers <strong>Philipp Geiler</strong> and <strong>Luc Renneboog</strong> pored over wage data for all the listed firms in the UK from 1996 to 2007 and found that female executive directors &mdash; but not the CEOs &mdash; are discriminated against when it comes to basic pay, incentives and total compensation. This amounts to a 15% lower salary and 20% lower bonus when compared with the industry standard for men. Equity-based pay also takes the biggest hit. The researchers say women employees end up making about &pound;269,000 less a year thanks to this disparity.</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>Title: </strong>Are Female Top Managers Really Paid Less</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>Source: </strong>Social Science Research Network</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Takes a village to raise a firm</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1">Many management gurus have attributed credit for business success to open communication.

(145, 12, '', 'Phone shopping, here and now', '<p class="p1">These days, promoters and senior executives at India&rsquo;s leading e-commerce firms have a common rallying cry &mdash; they&rsquo;re all about putting &lsquo;mobile first&rsquo; in their businesses. That hardly comes as a surprise. In what promises to be the world&rsquo;s second-largest market for mobile phones this year after China, it&rsquo;s becoming clear that a significant share of online transactions are shifting to mobile devices, like never before.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Ask Kunal Bahl, co-founder of Snapdeal, an online marketplace that&rsquo;s on target to achieve $1 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) or price of goods sold through its website this year. &ldquo;Just one year ago, mobile phones brought in 5% of our orders. Now it&rsquo;s close to 40%,&rdquo; he says, adding that he expects this figure to cross 50% in a few months. Snapdeal saw its visitor traffic over mobile increase by 60% during the past three months alone. A lot of that came from first-time visitors from their mobile phones. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty good sign,&rdquo; says Bahl.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Just one year ago, mobile phones brought in 5% of our orders. Now it''s close to 40%" - Kunal Bahl, co-founder, Snapdeal</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">There is enough reason to believe that this is the beginning of a new phase in e-commerce, where the ubiquity of mobile handsets will increasingly determine how people buy and sell online. A report released by IAMAI and IMRB in 2013 estimates that the number of mobile internet users in India will have crossed 150 million by the end of March 2014, with a quarter-on-quarter growth rate of nearly 20%. While urban India will continue to dominate and reach 153 million users by June 2014, growth in the rural segment is expected to be faster at 50% to touch 32 million mobile Internet users by June 2014.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Easy does it</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Behind the numbers is the fact that an entirely new breed of users is emerging who will access the internet for the first time through their feature phones or smartphones. And designing for the mobile isn&rsquo;t simply about creating a good-looking, loaded app. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about having more features. It&rsquo;s about having better performance. Phone data connectivity in India is very choppy, and we want to reduce clicks for the user. That requires a lot of customisation,&rdquo; says Bahl. A year ago, Snapdeal set up a separate team with a mandate to grow mobile-based revenues beyond those coming from desktop PCs. The 10-member team had people in technical, product management and marketing roles. &ldquo;Over the next three years, we expect 75-80% of our orders from mobile phones,&rdquo; says Bahl. He credits social media with promoting internet usage in mobile devices. &ldquo;Social media has been a very strong conduit for channeling users into mobile commerce,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Flipkart, too, has high ambitions, with over 50% of its orders expected to come from mobile devices in a year&rsquo;s time, up from the current 20% of total orders now. One in every five new customers for Flipkart comes through the mobile channel today, according to data shared by the company. &ldquo;Over two years from now, mobile is going to be the main channel. We are pretty much aligning our business strategy around this,&rdquo; says Saranagati Chatterjee, VP &mdash; products and mobile strategy at Flipkart. Many of its mobile channel customers are from smaller towns and Chatterjee expects a bulk of business to come from non-metros in the coming years through the mobile route.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Adapting to mobile is less of an issue with services-based portals, with some leading the transition. Online travel agency Makemytrip has its app developed across all mobile platforms &mdash; Android, Blackberry, iOS and Windows &mdash; besides an HTML version for feature-phones. Rajesh Magow, co-founder and India CEO, says 20% of Makemytrip&rsquo;s site traffic is contributed by its mobile apps. Also, nearly 10% of all standalone hotels, including nearly one-third of hotels in its &lsquo;Last Minute&rsquo; deals, are being booked via mobile devices now. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Info Edge, which owns leading properties such as Naukri, apart from real estate portal 99acres and matrimonial site Jeevansaathi, has between 20% to 30% of its traffic across its verticals coming from mobile phones now, according to CEO and MD, Hitesh Oberoi. It&rsquo;s the highest in Shiksha, its online education services marketplace. The mobile contribution for these could easily go up to 50% in a year-and-a-half, he estimates. Though smaller towns lead in terms of visitor traffic to its portals on mobile, Oberoi points out that these don&rsquo;t necessarily translate into revenues. &ldquo;Purchasing power for these visitors will follow with a lag, usually a year or so,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Appy with the change</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Developing apps is key to building a good mobile experience. &ldquo;Apps help improve user experience dramatically,&rdquo; says Oberoi. Info Edge has developed Android- and iOS-based mobile apps for 99acres and with an Android-based app already out for Naukri, it is developing an iOS-based app that will be out soon. Oberoi says app users are also seen as more serious and engaged with greater potential to make a purchase. Flipkart launched its mobile phone app for Android users in September last year, followed by the iOS app in December. It&rsquo;s preparing to come out with its Windows mobile-based app soon. &ldquo;With apps, the speed is much better and push notifications can only be done through apps,&rdquo; says Chatterjee. Creating multi-platform apps, though, takes time, and while leading e-commerce firms have dedicated teams for this, many are yet to come out with mobile apps. One reason, Oberoi points out, is the limited availability of mobile app developers. &ldquo;There are more web developers available today,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Amazon India, which launched its mobile apps for iOS and Android devices in October last year, has a barcode scanning feature to search for items on its site. &ldquo;Amazon.in is growing the fastest amongst all our sites in terms of mobile traffic and sales,&rdquo; says a spokesperson.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Mobile adds a new dimension of data through location and social networks" - Prasad Kompalli, chief strategy officer, Myntra</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Online fashion retailer Myntra has so far had a browser-based site for mobile phones and tablets, which contributes 25% of business. This number is expected to go up to 40% by the end of this year, says Prasad Kompalli, chief strategy officer at Myntra, after its smartphone apps come out next month. It will offer a unique experience that is easier to use and simple, he adds. &ldquo;We are looking at minimising choices and navigation for mobile users, and allowing for discovery as they go instead of dumping too many elements at once. It&rsquo;s a process of reduction.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Money matters</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Another key challenge in mobile transactions is payments. Storage of card data is one way out to make the process easier. While Flipkart has its Payzippy service, others offer similar options. E-commerce companies, however, are happier with cash on delivery (COD) for a reason. &ldquo;We encourage COD because product return rates are low and dropouts at the shopping cart level are also lower compared with online payments,&rdquo; says Kompalli.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">However, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of Noida-based One97 Communications, argues that the issue with online payments is more linked to the trust that consumers have in the order fulfillment process at the merchant&rsquo;s end, and not so much with making payment over the internet. His online payment services brand, Paytm, is focused almost entirely on mobile devices. Apart from enabling utility payments and mobile and DTH recharges, Paytm&rsquo;s mobile app has evolved into a marketplace for various merchants. Users of its mobile app can browse from a catalogue of over 100,000 products offered by its 250-odd merchant partners such as Zovi, Yebhi and Fern and Petals. &ldquo;We are positioning Paytm as a destination,&rdquo; says Sharma. The Paytm mobile app has delivered around 40% of the company&rsquo;s 6.5 million transactions last month, according to Sharma.</p>\n<p class="p3">Kompalli points out another benefit that mobile devices offer. &ldquo;Mobile adds a new dimension of data through location and social networks as apps give access to the phone address book. This helps personalise even more than we do on desktops,&rdquo; he says. The game, clearly, is about to change.&nbsp;</p>', 'Mobile transactions are taking off in India and e-commerce companies are pulling out all stops to make it easier for customers to splurge', '19', '', 0, '', 'phone-shopping-here-and-now-145', 140, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Phone shopping, here and now', 'Mobile transactions are taking off in India and e-commerce companies are pulling out all stops to make it easier for customers to splurge', '', '', '', 'Mobile shopping,Snapdeal,Flipkart,Makemytrip,Mobile apps,Myntra,Paytm', 0, NULL, '2015-01-19 18:36:15', '2015-01-19 18:58:49', '2014-04-26', 0),
(146, 16, '', 'Clog of the town', '<p class="p1">What&rsquo;s common to Tibetan monks, American nurses, toddler, tourists on the beach and celebrity chef Mario Batali? They all wear flat, often blindingly bright rubber/plastic slip-on shoes punctured with holes. In fact, Batali is so fond of his clogs (bright orange and he wears them *everywhere*) that he ordered 200 pairs when he heard Crocs planned to discontinue them in his favourite colour &mdash; that&rsquo;s in addition to the 30-odd pairs he already has. No one in India is quite that fond of Crocs, but Nissan Joseph, head of Crocs India, is hoping to get more and more customers interested in slipping into a pair of chunky clogs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But not just anybody. For a company that&rsquo;s named after a reptile and makes footwear that inspires hate websites, has made it to Time&rsquo;s list of worst inventions and been called the ugliest shoes ever, Crocs is unapologetically premium, with prices for its fully-imported range going from Rs 1,200 to Rs 6,000. &ldquo;If there are 25 million consumers in India, I am interested in only 3 million,&rdquo; says Joseph. So far, most of that subset has been buying its Crocs in the metros &mdash; Crocs has 35 exclusive stores and is also available in 400 multi-brand outlets (MBOs) such as Lifestyle, Reliance Footsteps and Metro, an increase of eight and 100, respectively, over last year. Now, though, the American footwear brand is opening up to the idea of reaching deeper into India, to cities such as Nagpur, Guwahati and Gangtok. This year, the company will add 10-12 more stores and 100 more MBOs, says Joseph, and most of these will be in tier 1 and 2 cities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The second part of the strategy is to partner with key e-commerce retailers. &ldquo;They give access to 26,000 zipcodes across India,&rdquo; points out Joseph. Currently, the online sales channel brings in negligible revenue, but the aim is to take this up to double digits soon. Here, too, Crocs is determined to maintain its plastic-but-posh positioning. It has pulled its products out of over several e-retail sites since they were offering steep discounts on retail prices. &ldquo;We are very careful that they don&rsquo;t use our brand online as a discount brand to acquire customers. That demolishes brand equity,&rdquo; says Joseph. Now, Crocs will have exclusive tie-ups with only Amazon and Jabong, which will offer the complete range of 100 Crocs styles (no, it doesn&rsquo;t sell just clogs) at prices similar to what the stores offer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Crocs Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Not surprisingly, then, there&rsquo;s no question of a differential pricing strategy for non-metro markets. &ldquo;The time for that is not yet. When you go that round [reducing prices], you still have to preserve what makes you good and for Crocs, that is Croslite. If I took Croslite away to lower the price, I don&rsquo;t have a reason to exist,&rdquo; Joseph points out. Croslite is the proprietary foam resin from which all Crocs products are made. The closed-cell resin keeps out dirt and water and is resilient to compression. Crocs&rsquo; patent on it means it has no direct competition but fake Crocs are available everywhere, from street vendors to big stores.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Learning curve</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The easy availability of croc-offs and the high pricing of the originals has meant Crocs hasn&rsquo;t grown all that fast in India. The company was founded in Colorado in 2002 after acquiring the Croslite technology from a Quebec-based company. In a few short years, Crocs was an international rage (or fashion disaster run amok, depending on whom you asked) and it meandered into India in 2007 through a joint venture with Chogori India Retail (the Indian operation is now a franchise). Joseph agrees that Crocs&rsquo; progress here could have been faster. &ldquo;We made mistakes in the Indian market, experimenting with style assortments and a developed-for-India product that didn&rsquo;t work. We also tried to reach too many MBOs initially,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;The biggest learning has been not to do everything itself. Unlike in other markets, in India, Crocs has partners for distribution, logistics and retail. The competencies and relationships required to run a store in Rajasthan are different from those needed in Tamil Nadu, explains Joseph. &ldquo;As a brand, we could spend years building&nbsp; those competencies or we could find people with such competencies.&rdquo; The difference is showing in the books, he adds: sales have doubled in the past two years and growth in Q4CY13 was 40% more than the previous quarter. Crocs doesn&rsquo;t share country-specific numbers, but annualised retail sales in 2013 was over Rs 100 crore, according to industry insiders. &ldquo;We manage product, segmentation and marketing and then coordinate the logistics. So we truly are brand managers in India,&rdquo; Joseph adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Not that the brand managers have been pushing the brand much in the past seven years. Crocs doesn&rsquo;t advertise in India at all, although it is fairly active on social media. Entering smaller cities, though, seems to call for a shift in marketing strategy as well, so actor Yami Gautam has been roped in as brand ambassador &mdash; the first campaign should break in late May or early June.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Will presence and a star endorsement be enough to draw customers from tier 2 cities? Mukhtarul Ameen, chairman of Superhouse group, which makes Lee Cooper shoes, thinks it might work. &ldquo;We are such a large country that even in a tier 2 city such as Kanpur, Crocs may find customers. The high price also means higher margins to sustain your business.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>', 'Crocs is heading to smaller cities, but is retaining its plastic-but-posh positioning  ', '9', '', 0, '', 'clog-of-the-town-146', 141, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Clog of the town', 'Crocs is heading to smaller cities, but is retaining its plastic-but-posh positioning  ', '', '', '', 'Crocs,Nissan Joseph,Croslite', 0, NULL, '2015-01-19 19:02:30', '2015-01-19 19:14:49', '2014-04-26', 0),

For the CEO of the TV channel that telecasts stunt show <em>Khataron ke khiladi</em>, the passion for taking risks started quite tamely. As a child, Nayak was fascinated with the magic tricks his brother used to pull on him and got a friend to teach him some. &ldquo;I started practising and picked up supplies from a street seller in Covent Garden while on a trip to London.

I decided to replicate the experience at a bigger conference, and when the trainer couldn&rsquo;t make it for the event, her assistants and I led the team through the process.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">There was no stopping after that. From walking on glass to bending iron rods with his neck and eating fire, Nayak has been there, done that and led his team through it all. The thrill and confidence these feats gave him was unmatched, and it motivated him to get certified in fire walking from a US-based institute. &ldquo;Walking on fire is like bungee jumping &mdash; you do it once and you feel tempted to have another go at it. You just need to have trust, faith and belief in your own self; no harm can come to you if you&rsquo;re in the moment,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Nayak soon discovered the team-building prospects of these feats. &ldquo;When I joined Colors as CEO, I designed my first conference as an <em>agni pariksha</em>. People walked in expecting droll PPTs and walked out having walked on fire; every single person in the room made their way to the other side. Once you walk on fire, nothing &mdash; in work and life &mdash; can appear daunting,&rdquo; he beams.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">This penchant for risk-taking extends to the work sphere as well &mdash; the channel took a gamble with the Indian iteration of international thriller series <span class="s2"><em>24</em></span> and the rib-tickling <em>Comedy nights with Kapil,</em> and it paid off in the ratings game. &ldquo;The reason magic &mdash; and TV &mdash; works so well is because everybody needs an escape.

(151, 24, '', 'Bidding for baubles', '<p class="p1">June 6 will see the gavel descend on 10 pieces of unique jewellery to be auctioned by Julien-Vincent Brunie of Christie&rsquo;s at The Oberoi Trident in Mumbai. Supported by Gemfields for charity NGO Nanhi Kali and flagged by Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, it will feature designs by 10 well-known stores using emeralds mined in Zambia and rubies in Mozambique &mdash; the products of Gemfields, which has been in the mining business since the 1940s. The estimates for the lots range from Rs 21 lakh to Rs 88 lakh, though this might change depending on the bidding, and it is hoped the auction will help raise between $150,000 and $200,000 for charity.</p>\n<p class="p3">Such CSR activities are hardly new to Gemfields, which has in the past supported Mark Shand&rsquo;s efforts to set up elephant corridors in India (for which it raised $100,000). The effort aims to combine charity with savvy marketing, as Gemfields hopes to do for coloured gemstones what de Beers did for diamonds. At a time when Colombian emeralds, for instance, have run their course, Gemfields is promoting Zambia for its &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; mining &mdash; no child labour is involved. The profits are not used for anti-social activities and there is no money laundering involved. Old and defunct mines are either filled with earth and allowed to return to a natural state for farming purposes or flooded with water to permit fishing. And with the mined gemstones now being auctioned locally &mdash; i.e., within Zambia &mdash; it has become a saviour for the local economy, boosting its tourism prospects in the bargain.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;India and coloured gemstones have a rich and powerful history and the country has played an important part in Gemfields&rsquo; success as a business,&rdquo; says its London-based CEO Ian Harebottle. Certainly, 95% of those gemstones pass through the crowded bylanes of Jaipur, where they are graded, hand-cut and polished before being sold. Typically, Gemfields does not disclose its reserve prices ahead of its auction for mined roughs, which is why pricing, says its regional director marketing-Asia, Rupak Sen, is &ldquo;judgemental, with huge differences between one bidder and the next&rdquo;. Prices for its Zambian emeralds have been rising, having gone up by as much as 10 times between June 2009 and December 2013. Stringent disclosures are followed, so if baby oil or paraffin is used in its treatment, or bonding is undertaken, it needs to be mentioned as part of the history.</p>\n<p class="p3">The June auction of jewellery that was put together using Gemfields gemstones casts emeralds and rubies alongside diamonds and yellow and white gold. The 10 chosen pieces have been designed by jewellery stores Abaran (Bangalore), Amrapali (Jaipur), Anmol (Mumbai), Hazoorilal (New Delhi), Lala Jugal Kishore (Lucknow), Mirari (New Delhi), Moksh (Mumbai), Narayan (Baroda), Talwarsons (Chandigarh) and Tibarumals (Hyderabad). The designs range from the pretty and floral (but overwhelming) to the Art Deco and contemporary. With Nanhi Kali as its beneficiary and Chitrangada Singh as its ambassador, the auction might serve to bring more than just colour to another social event in Mumbai by ensuring that the lives of 90,000 underprivileged girls are impacted in a way they could hardly have imagined &mdash; simply because someone decided to take home a piece of designer jewellery.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>&mdash;The writer is a Delhi-based author and curator</strong></p>', 'Two jewellery auctions — in Mumbai and Hong Kong — are using emeralds, rubies and diamonds to redefine the idea of giving till it hurts', '17', '', 0, '', 'bidding-for-baubles-151', 146, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Bidding for baubles', 'Two jewellery auctions — in Mumbai and Hong Kong — are using emeralds, rubies and diamonds to redefine the idea of giving till it hurts', '', '', '', 'Jewellery auctions,Julien-Vincent Brunie,Christie''s,Gemfields', 0, NULL, '2015-01-19 20:29:16', '2015-01-19 20:48:35', '2014-04-26', 0),
(152, 24, '', 'The family way', '<p class="p1">There has been a surge of dynasties in India during the past decade&hellip; Defenders and apologists for what has been happening argue that dynastic politicians have to go through the hoop of being elected, and that their only advantage is the family brand, which eases their entry into politics.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">The best survey was conducted by Patrick French, an author and historian, when he was writing a book, India: A Portrait, with the help of regional journalists and a young statistics cruncher, Arun Kaul.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">They found that, led by the Gandhis, more than a third of the Congress Party&rsquo;s MPs elected in 2009 had come into politics through a family link. Literally all the MPs (not just Congress) aged under 30, and more than two-thirds of those under 40, were from hereditary political families, whereas less than 10 per cent of MPs over the age of 70 were dynastic. He classified 27 MPs as &lsquo;hyper-hereditary&rsquo;, including 19 from the Congress, meaning those who had multiple family connections and several family members with political careers.</p>\n<p class="p2">Regional state-based parties had a higher incidence of hereditary MPs than national parties. All five MPs from Uttar Pradesh&rsquo;s Rashtriya Lok Dal Party <br /> (National People&rsquo;s Party) had family links, including Ajit Singh, the party leader and son of Charan Singh, who was briefly (1979-80) prime minister. This was also true of six out of 14 MPs belonging to the Orissa-based Biju Janata Dal led by Naveen Patnaik and three MPs from Jammu and Kashmir&rsquo;s National Conference headed by Farooq and Omar Abdullah.</p>\n<p class="p2">Seven out of nine MPs from the Maharashtra-based Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) &mdash; founded and led by Sharad Pawar, a powerful national and regional politician who split from the main Congress party in 1999 over Sonia Gandhi&rsquo;s emerging role &mdash; hailed from political families. Only one MP from the NCP did not have a politically significant family background. Pawar&rsquo;s acolyte, Praful Patel, is one of the country&rsquo;s richest MPs&hellip;.</p>\n<p class="p2">French surmised that, since the tendency to turn politics into a family business was being emulated across northern India at the state level, with legislators nominating relatives, there was no reason to believe it was not spreading to districts. Other sources suggest that in Mumbai&rsquo;s 2012 municipal elections, where for the first time 50 per cent of the seats were reserved for women, many of the women candidates were &lsquo;stooges for their politically ensconced kin&rsquo;, representing men in their families &lsquo;who are the back room boys&rsquo;.</p>\n<p class="p2">Evidence found later by the French supports my theory that wealth and greed are linked with the growth of dynasties. Aaditya Dar, one of his postgraduate researchers, merged their study findings with a report on the 2009 financial and criminal records of Lok Sabha MPs prepared by the Delhi-based Association for Democratic Reforms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Based on MPs&rsquo; official (though not always complete) declarations of wealth, this showed that hereditary MPs were four-and-a-half times wealthier than those with no significant political background. Hyper-hereditary MPs were the wealthiest of all. Their average total assets were roughly double those of the hereditary MPs, and they exceeded even MPs with a business background. Of the 20 richest MPs, 15 were hereditary politicians and 10 were in the Congress.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Insights</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p2"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">What drives performance &mdash; incentives or control?</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1">What is the best way for managers to ensure that their workers&rsquo; conduct is in the interest of the company?

The researchers add that increased managerial control also protected the organisation from moral hazard on part of the workers, which means actions on the mechanics&rsquo; part that might lead to loss of revenue.

Senior living is a $25-billion industry globally and the US alone has over 2,000 housing projects catering to this community. Now, there&rsquo;s a boom in this sector in India as well, albeit on a much smaller scale &mdash; according to some reports, there are already over 30 projects in the country exclusively for older people, with an equal number in the pipeline. Most of these projects are located outside smaller towns, in locales carefully selected for their salubrious climate and pollution-free surroundings away from the hustle and bustle of big cities. But there&rsquo;s a flip side to so much peace and quiet &mdash; getting out can be a problem, finding help isn&rsquo;t easy and seclusion can all too easily segue into loneliness and separation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Some developers are now working to keep the golden oldies in the mainstream. Coimbatore-based Serene Retirement Communities has completed four senior living projects in Coimbatore and Puducherry. Now, it is focusing on the integrated senior housing model, where retirement homes are part of a larger township. &ldquo;Awareness and interest in such homes is really going up,&rdquo; says PB Anand, CEO, Serene Retirement Communities. In 2012, the company launched its first integrated senior living project, Serene Adinath, with Chennai-based developer Adinath Foundation. While the property will be operational by July 2014, all 240 retirement homes of the total 600 have been sold.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The second project in Chennai is what Anand calls the only &ldquo;hybrid model&rdquo; in his portfolio, where seniors live among other residents, with some apartments earmarked for them on each floor, rather than in separate buildings in the same complex. Serene Pushkar has 130 units within the 500-house complex, and Anand says 60% have already been sold.</p>\n<p class="p3">For its Bengaluru project, Serene has tied up with a local builder, Ozone, to make 314 retirement homes in the first phase as part of the builder&rsquo;s upcoming 150-acre township at Hebbal. All flats have been sold, and Serene is in talks to build another 200 in the township. Similarly, it has signed up to build 250 apartments within MAK Projects&rsquo;s new Banyan Tree Retreat in Hyderabad. The project, launched in December 2013, has seen 30% of the apartments sold already. &ldquo;We created awareness that this is a lifestyle option, not about living in retirement homes,&rdquo; says Anand.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We created awareness that this is a lifestyle option, not about retirement homes" - PB Anand, CEO, Serene Retirement Communities</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Others are launching similar, integrated living projects.

Access will be open to the club and other facilities in the main township. There is even a tie-up with private schools nearby for teaching opportunities for these older residents. &ldquo;This is an attempt to break away from senior citizen residential projects that create a sense of isolation among their residents from mainstream living,&rdquo; says Arun Gupta, CEO, Age Ventures India (AVI). &ldquo;The world over, isolation is being criticised.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Our attempt is to break away from projects that isolate senior citizens" -</strong> <strong>Arun Gupta, CEO, Age Ventures India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">A private trust set up in 2008, AVI partners with real estate developers on creating such spaces within their upcoming communities. It works on a knowledge-sharing&nbsp;agreement with Helpage India and the Methodist Housing Association (MHA) of the UK, which is involved in care giving and housing support for the elderly.

Moreover, disabled-friendly systems are hardly developed in Indian society, even in the major cities. &ldquo;At 60+ years of age, the supply of resources begins to dwindle like a hockey stick curve or it&rsquo;s mismatched to their needs,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">With prices starting at Rs 60-85 lakh for a 1BHK at current prices, not surprisingly, these separate-yet-together projects aren&rsquo;t for everyone.

(156, 12, '', 'Counting on supportive healthcare', '<p class="p1">Speak with any start-up veteran and they will tell you that when you&rsquo;re starting on your own, it&rsquo;s even more important to know what not to do than it is to know what to do. Luckily, for A Arvindkumar and V Ramakrishnan, that&rsquo;s what they learnt even before setting up their own company. Their earlier experience in the healthcare technology and software space had convinced the two software geeks that there were cheaper, faster and simpler ways of providing similar services. So, when they launched their company in 2008, that&rsquo;s exactly what they kept in mind. &ldquo;We knew there were better ways to do this than what was being done,&rdquo; says Arvindkumar, the 35-year-old CEO of Attune Technologies. And what&rsquo;s &ldquo;this&rdquo;? It is providing healthcare IT products to manage patient data and workflow &mdash; something the Singapore-headquartered company does on the cloud for hospitals, diagnostic labs and imaging centres, dialysis centres and clinics in India and abroad, logging in over 2 million patient records so far and bringing in $2.5 million in revenue last year.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>Humble beginnings</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Arvindkumar and Ramakrishnan first met in early 2000, when they both joined the erstwhile DSQ Software. A few years later, they were at iSoft when work started on the British National Health Service&rsquo;s Connecting for Health (CFH) project. One of the largest civilian IT projects, CFH was an initiative started in 2005 to create a single electronic record for patients in the UK, connecting thousands of practitioners and hundreds of hospitals. &ldquo;The idea was good but there were several issues with the technology, not to mention the time and cost overruns,&rdquo; recalls Arvindkumar, who quit the company in 2007 to pursue his MBA from IIM Calcutta.</p>\n<p class="p5">On graduation, he decided to start his own company based on the same idea but built on the cloud. With Ramakrishnan and school friend Mohanaraj, who came on board as the first investor, he teamed up with Anand Gnanaraj, a cardiologist who provided the domain expertise, and launched Attune Technologies with an initial investment of Rs 50 lakh from their combined savings. Parthasarathy, a friend from his DSQ days, joined them soon after in 2009 to head the sales and marketing function. Attune got off to a good start &mdash; it had two clients already signed on before the first version of the product was up and running in May 2009.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">What did the company do? When it started, the founders wanted to position Attune Technologies as a firm that would maintain electronic medical records for hospitals. But when they took the first prototype to clients, they discovered that many hospitals didn&rsquo;t have even a basic IT system in place, so it was back to the drawing board to create a product in line with Indian healthcare industry needs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">The result is a technology platform that offers a cloud-based solution for hospitals (Attune Health Kernel), laboratories (Attune Lab Kernel) and clinics (Attune Clinic Kernel). The clients invest in the PCs and internet connection, while the rest of the IT infrastructure and software is managed on the cloud by Attune. The company has around 120 employees, more than half of whom work at the product development centre in Chennai, while others are scattered over offices in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam and West Asia. Attune isn&rsquo;t the only company offering healthcare IT solutions. It has several competitors in the healthcare IT space, from big players such as TCS and Wipro who also pitch to large hospitals, to companies such as Insta Health when reaching out to smaller hospitals. The difference is that Attune is more focused on the cloud-based model, getting two-thirds of its revenue from this.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>All under one umbrella - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">Attune&rsquo;s hospital information system (HIS) integrates all the departments, including billing, purchasing and inventory, and different branches of a hospital across the country. This is in contrast to existing healthcare IT systems that have different systems for billing, scheduling, laboratory and radiology and are built in silos with hospitals having to deal with different vendors and integration capabilities. Clients can either choose a product installation, which requires a licence fee, or pay a monthly rent for using the services on the Attune cloud, depending on existing infrastructure and needs. Switching to a cloud-based system can help hospital and diagnostic chains save up to 60% of their IT costs, according to the company. &ldquo;This way, clients don&rsquo;t have to put in place an entire IT infrastructure. They have to pay neither hefty licence fees upfront, nor upgradation fees for every product upgrade,&rdquo; points out Ramakrishnan, CTO, Attune Technologies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">Similarly, Attune offers diagnostic chains the ability to track samples from the point of collection to storage through its lab information systems (LIS), as well as generate customised reports. It started looking at diagnostic labs as an opportunity in 2009, when a hospital client asked whether it would be possible to replicate the system for diagnostic labs. The team decided to study the market: a survey of 200 independent labs found most labs were struggling to make money. &ldquo;We knew multi-centre diagnostic chains were the future. We knew standalone diagnostic labs either had to become part of a larger chain or shut down. So we decided to build a product for multi-centre labs,&rdquo; says Arvindkumar.</p>\n<p class="p5">Now, hospitals and diagnostic chains contribute equally to the revenue and two of the largest diagnostic lab chains in India, Metropolis and Medall, are Attune&rsquo;s clients, in addition to over 100 healthcare institutions across seven countries. In India, several small and medium hospitals, including Kamatchi Memorial and Kurinji hospitals, Nationwide (a chain of primary health clinics) and ASG Hospital (a super-specialty eye hospital), use Attune products. Quite a change from the initial days.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>Mid-life crisis</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Certainly, it hasn&rsquo;t been a smooth journey all through for Attune. The first couple of years were particularly tough, especially 2009, when a promised investment of Rs 40 lakh fell through at the last minute, leaving Kumar and Co with not enough money to pay salaries. While friends and family pitched in to help tide over this money crunch, the management went without pay for six months during the second half of 2009. &ldquo;At no point of time did we think of throwing in the towel. We knew we had gotten the business model and product fit right. It was only a matter of time before it was validated,&rdquo; says Ramakrishnan.</p>\n<p class="p5">The validation happened in January 2010, when Attune got its first angel investment from Ravindran Govindan. When the Singapore-based angel investor met the management at a prospective client&rsquo;s office, he asked why Attune wasn&rsquo;t scaling up, given that its product had potential, and was told about the lack of funds. On returning to Singapore, Govindan sent Attune a cheque for Rs 1 crore. Later the same year, he and some friends invested a further $1 million in Attune.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">Two years later, the founders&rsquo; faith in their company was further endorsed when Attune raised $6 million in series A funding from Norwest Venture Partners to scale up its business across geographies. &ldquo;We were looking to invest in companies that use next-generation technology to solve problems in India,&rdquo; says Mohan Kumar, executive director, Norwest Venture Partners, India. &ldquo;What works to Attune&rsquo;s advantage is that not only does it have a large core market in India for its product, it also has similar markets in South East Asia, Africa and Middle East, where it can scale up presence.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>"We were looking to invest in firms using next-gen technology to solve problems here" - Mohan Kumar, executive director, Norwest Venture&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">Certainly, the market opportunity is huge, given how healthcare delivery is changing. With more hospitals and labs turning into multi-centre facilities and the increasing penetration of insurance, there is greater need for standardisation, compelling hospitals and labs to invest in technology. The adoption of the cloud-based model is thus bound to increase. There are over 100,000 hospitals and 70,000 standalone diagnostic labs in India and even as they consolidate, Attune has a large playing field. Achieving its target of doubling revenue to $5 million in another two years, then, looks eminently doable.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">&ldquo;The spend on technology in Indian healthcare is less than 1%, giving ample headroom for growth for companies such as Attune. As healthcare spend increases as a percentage of GDP, hospitals and labs will make larger bets on technology, which will bode well for healthcare technology companies,&rdquo; confirms Kumar.</p>\n<p class="p5">Ramakrishnan believes that next-generation companies such as Attune have a distinct advantage over traditional companies in the IT space, given their cloud-based model. &ldquo;With the pay-as-you-go model, you pay only for the resources that you use and can scale up quickly when you expand, without large incremental costs,&rdquo; he points out.</p>\n<p class="p5">Going forward, Attune hopes to use this advantage to emerge as a global product made in India. &ldquo;What China did for manufacturing and Japan and Korea did for cars, I think India can do for IT products,&rdquo; says Arvindkumar, who believes that once outpatient treatment comes under the ambit of insurance coverage in India, as is expected in the next couple of years, there will be no looking back for the company. &ldquo;That will lead to greater technology adoption by GP clinics, which will open up a new market for us.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>', 'Attune Technologies offers integrated, cloud-based IT solutions to hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and medical clinics', '6', '', 0, '', 'counting-on-supportive-healthcare-156', 151, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Counting on supportive healthcare ', 'Attune Technologies offers integrated, cloud-based IT solutions to hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and medical clinics', '', '', '', 'Attune Technologies,Healthcare IT products,Cloud-based healthcare solutions,TCS,Wipro,Metropolis,Medall', 0, NULL, '2015-01-19 23:30:10', '2015-01-20 14:34:58', '2014-04-12', 0),
(157, 16, '', 'Going gaga over radio', '<p class="p1">Talk about the perfect radio face. Mumbai RJ Jeeturaaj makes it a point to remain hidden from sight, even when he&rsquo;s photographed with celebrities. You may see his back, his headphones strategically placed in front of his face, his arms decked with a multitude of beaded bracelets, and his surprising taste in clothes, perhaps an occasional side profile or a view of reflective sunglasses, but you won&rsquo;t get a glimpse of his face. The Radio Mirchi RJ is so fanatical about staying anonymous that a few months ago, when he performed live in Zurich after winning the Sound of India contest, he wore a cardboard boom box over his head &mdash; still, people took it in their stride since the boom box head is the symbol of the International Radio Festival. &ldquo;Brand Jeeturaaj is very different from Jeeturaaj the person. What you hear on radio isn&rsquo;t the person,&rdquo; says Prashant Panday, CEO of Entertainment Network India (ENIL), which owns Radio Mirchi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s2">His most popular RJ may shun the limelight, but Panday has no qualms about tom-tomming the company&rsquo;s achievements. Well, he does have plenty to exult about. With 32 stations across 14 states, Radio Mirchi may be only the third-biggest national player, behind Red FM (47 stations) and </span>Big FM (45), but it is the leader in the Indian radio market, with over 30% revenue market share. More importantly, this 15-year-old subsidiary of Bennett, Coleman (BCCL) group company, Times Infotainment Media, is among the very few profitable FM radio firms in the country, alone accounting for nearly 75% of the industry&rsquo;s Ebitda. &ldquo;During my tenure as CEO, we have doubled our revenue compared with the next broadcaster and have perhaps grown our Ebitda five to six times. Our clients are happy with the fact that we are a solutions provider rather than a mere vendor of free commercial time and our shareholders have got good returns on their investment,&rdquo; says Panday, who has been with ENIL since inception and took over as CEO in 2007. Sounds like a perfect symphony, doesn&rsquo;t it? So, what accounts for ENIL&rsquo;s golden run and can it continue winning at the same frequency as the FM radio industry heads towards phase III?</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Tuning in</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">But first, some background. While FM radio in India has been around since 1977, it was the monopoly of the state-owned All India Radio until July 1999, when the government decided to allow private players to enter the FM radio business. In the first phase, open, ascending auction led to speculative bidding that, combined with a 15% annual hike in licensing fee, proved disastrous for the budding industry. Of the 121 licences on offer, only 21 became operational, while small players in Rajasthan and Kolkata soon moved the dial to &lsquo;off&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In 2006, the government again auctioned spectrum, this time with a one-time fee and revenue-share arrangement. This time, 245 licences were granted to 38 companies in 86 cities. But the aggressive bidding and the pressure on ad rates have ensured that most radio companies in India are still struggling &mdash; while some players such as the Zee group surrendered their licenses within a couple of years, others are still reporting losses or minimal profits. &ldquo;Radio Mirchi is the only FM radio station to have consistently reported operating and net profits for the last seven years,&rdquo; says a December 2012 CII-E&amp;Y report on the FM radio industry in India. In FY13, ENIL had a profit of Rs 68 crore on a revenue of Rs 338 crore, a 20% increase over the previous year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It turns out that ENIL has been hitting the right notes since its inception. For starters, it was a cautious bidder in the FM auctions. ENIL cumulatively spent Rs 326 crore in the first two phases, but by bidding for only those circles where it felt the returns justified the investment, especially in category A and A+ towns, the company lost out on areas such as Chandigarh, Patiala, Agra and Kochi. But what it lost on the swings, it made up on the roundabouts: Panday quotes IRS data that shows Radio Mirchi is the No.1 player in revenue terms in all 32 cities where it is present. &ldquo;ENIL is one of the few companies that participated in both phases of auctions. It has an enviable network and circles, including lucrative category A and A+ circles that many others don&rsquo;t. It has also built up a strong brand for itself,&rdquo; declares Tarun Katial, CEO, Reliance Broadcast Network, which runs the radio channel Big FM.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"ENIL has an enviable network of circles and has built a strong brand for itself" - Tarun Katial, CEO, Reliance Broadcast Network</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In terms of listenership, too, Panday points out that Radio Mirchi is No.1 in 22 cities and No.2 in eight &mdash; it has the highest number of listeners in the industry at 38 million, compared with 22 million for Red FM. That is a result of Radio Mirchi&rsquo;s programming mix, believes Naval Seth, research analyst at Emkay. &ldquo;The kind of music being played, the timing of the shows and the RJs all contribute to the popularity of the shows and, at the end of the day, it is the attractiveness of content that retains listeners,&rdquo; he points out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s especially significant when you consider the restrictions on programming content. According to current rules, private FM channels cannot broadcast news, live sports or weather bulletins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Most stations provide the same genre of content. Furthermore, given the large amounts paid to acquire licences, the content must appeal to a large audience base to most effectively monetise investments and therefore, radio stations generally broadcast content and formats that have mass appeal,&rdquo; says the E&amp;Y report.</p>\n<p class="p3">Still, Radio Mirchi has managed to differentiate itself. It was the pioneer of the retro music genre in India, with its evening programme Purani Jeans (now, some channels such as Radio One in Kolkata and Ahmedabad and Big FM have gone completely retro). The positioning is also consciously positive: &ldquo;Like the group&rsquo;s broadsheet, <em>The Times of India</em>, our jocks consciously look for positive subplots in everything. Radio Mirchi is like a pep-up pill for its listeners,&rdquo; says Panday. That is echoed in the tagline: Mirchi <em>sunnewale</em> always <em>khush</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Radio juggernaut- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Panday also emphasises the localisation of content when it comes to jock talk. The breakfast shows on Radio Mirchi are the main driver of listenership, so the emphasis on local conversation is more apparent here &mdash; the production team and the RJ usually refer to a variety of sources to gather material for the show, always with the filter that it should be appropriate and relevant to that city. Content for the rest of the day is more generic, but local touches come in through the jock talk, local lingo and interactive sessions with listeners.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Radio Mirchi also depends heavily on research to ensure that the company is on the right track. Proprietary research before launching a station offers market insights, while ongoing research &mdash; including peeping into cars to see which radio channel is playing &mdash; ensures that the channel is on the same wavelength as its listeners. It is also one of the few FM channels that has an online as well as mobile radio presence, with four mobile stations and nine internet radio stations, each catering to a different genre such as modern Bollywood, Hindi retro, Western music and club mixes. &ldquo;In a year and a half, we have had over 200 million streams on these stations,&rdquo; says Panday.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Good vibrations</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">If Radio Mirchi&rsquo;s content has brought in listeners, they, in turn, have attracted advertisers. At present, the channel has over 5,000 clients and at Rs 10,000 for a 10-second spot on all 32 channels, its advertising rates are the highest in the industry. It&rsquo;s still lower than the 2008 peak of Rs 12,500, but with radio inventories fully exhausted, Panday says rate increases are a certainty, going forward. &ldquo;This year, with political advertising expected in big dollops, we believe overall pricing will climb,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">It helps that ENIL is part of the BCCL stable. Getting access to clients becomes a whole lot easier, as is recovering payments from sticky clients refusing to pay up on time. &ldquo;Being part of the Times Group allows ENIL access to preferential rates in advertising, access to private treaty clients and the ability to cross the moat on other media vehicles,&rdquo; says Rahul Gupta, CEO, Radio Mantra, which has eight stations in four states in north India. About half of Radio Mirchi&rsquo;s clients are also advertisers with newspapers, and like other radio companies, ENIL&rsquo;s top advertisers are real estate, retail and travel companies and government agencies. There are no annual contracts and seasonal campaigns are the norm here. &ldquo;Nearly 55% of our revenue comes in the second half, when most companies intensify their campaigns compared with the rest of the year,&rdquo; says Panday.</p>\n<p class="p3">Radio Mirchi doesn&rsquo;t offer just plain vanilla advertising. ENIL has developed a basket of non-radio products such as digital activations, TV properties and multimedia solutions, which constitute nearly 25% of its revenues. There&rsquo;s also a captive creative unit that creates customised radio campaigns for brands, working on everything from creating on-air spots to on-ground activations and promotions and viral campaigns. For instance, for Idea Cellular&rsquo;s &lsquo;save trees&rsquo; campaign, the channel launched a &lsquo;paperless&rsquo; ride over the Bandra-Worli Sealink: listeners would get SMS toll receipts that the sealink operator honoured. Then, when Pepsi was creating a new jingle, Radio Mirchi invited listeners from Hindi-speaking markets to send in their compositions and brought in Bollywood composers Vishal-Shekhar to the studio to compose music for these lyrics. The result: while the industry grew by 10% y-o-y in FY13, ENIL grew faster, at 12.3%, improving its revenue market share in the process.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Cash call</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">Overall industry growth has meant that the others are cashing in as well. There&rsquo;s been a steady rise in advertisers, which has led to the industry growing from Rs 830 crore in 2009 to Rs 1,460 crore in 2013, a CAGR of over 15%, which is higher than all other traditional media segments, according to a Ficci-KPMG report. Over the next five years, the industry is expected to grow even faster at 18%, and cross Rs 3,360 crore by 2018. Despite those impressive numbers, radio remains a very minor player in advertising, accounting for just 4-4.5% of the total advertising pie, although it&rsquo;s still an improvement over the 1.4% of 2005.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">For most advertisers, radio is an add-on medium or even used to clean up whatever&rsquo;s left of the ad budget. But it also has its share of admirers. &ldquo;Across the Aditya Birla financial services group, we ensure we invest in radio as it is a great medium for consumer engagement and helps us stay in the mass media for the greater duration of the year in a cost-effective way. Its reach extending to tier 3 and 4 towns will only present more opportunities for us,&rdquo; says Ajay Kakar, CMO, Birla Sun Life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We invest in radio as it is a great medium for consumer engagement" - Ajay Kakar, CMO, Birla Sun Life</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">While it will be a long while, if ever, before radio becomes a worthy competitor to television and print, it&rsquo;s already come a long way. &ldquo;Five years ago, radio was an afterthought for advertisers while allocating budgets. Today, advertisers have come to understand the efficacy of radio as a medium through experience and the efforts of radio broadcasters,&rdquo; says Jehil Thakkar, partner and head of the media and entertainment practice at KPMG India. For his part, Panday believes growth in media comes from growth in supply, which means radio is likely to see explosive growth once phase III is implemented.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>New frequency&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">There is a lot riding on the phase III auction of FM radio licences, whenever it happens &mdash; it&rsquo;s been delayed three years already. With this, radio will move out of the current 86 tier 1 and 2 cities to 294 tier 3 and 4 towns with a population of 100,000-300,000, exponentially increasing the reach of FM radio in India &mdash; only 50 of the 800 frequencies offered are in category A and B cities; the rest are in C and D towns. Moreover, broadcasters will be allowed second and third frequencies in A+ cities, leading to differentiated content targeting different consumers; smaller cities can also be networked with big ones, saving on operational costs. &ldquo;If a broadcaster has to create different content for all his stations, it is prohibitively expensive. Network sharing will prove a boon for all players,&rdquo; says Thakkar. Big FM&rsquo;s Katial puts the phase III expansion in perspective. &ldquo;This will enable radio to get a greater share of advertising, from the current 4% to 7-9%, as a result of greater reach across India as well as differentiated content, which will pull in new advertisers,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">And how is Panday planning to make the most of it? Under phase III, ENIL will &ldquo;definitely&rdquo; bid for the single FM frequency in Delhi and two in Mumbai, in addition to smaller towns around the country. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t necessarily want to have the largest network but we want to be the biggest in revenue and profit,&rdquo; says Panday. The capital cost of setting up a new station is between Rs 1 crore in small towns and up to Rs 6-8 crore in metros, while operating costs for a small station fluctuate between Rs 70 lakh and Rs 1 crore a year. &ldquo;If revenue potential of a town is less than Rs 1 crore, we aren&rsquo;t interested,&rdquo; he says. The target for the new stations is the same as it was for phase II: break-even at the Ebitda level in six to eight quarters. The bid for new cities, then, will be made only at prices that are viable.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Top jock- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">That looks difficult as phase III will also be an open, ascending auction and the reserve price for circles has been set based on the highest rate received for a similar city in phase II. That means all C circle cities, such as Bilaspur and Aligarh, will have a reserve price of #15.6 crore, since that is what the C-circle Chandigarh licence fetched last time. &ldquo;E-auction is fine for sectors such as metals and telecom as there is not too much product differentiation there. But in radio, if every bidder has to pay the exact same amount to win a licence, how will differentiated products emerge? The reserve price is too high and will lead to failure of the auctions,&rdquo; declares Panday. He is tight-lipped about which small towns Radio Mirchi will target, only saying that the company is following &ldquo;scientific models&rdquo; to estimate revenue potential, cost structure and profit margin of potential locations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Panday is more open when speaking about the potential phase III brings. &ldquo;If we have a station in a tier 3 town, we can provide advertisers with lower pricing than a tier 2 city and tailor-make content for the area. There is definite interest among both national and regional advertisers,&rdquo; he says. That&rsquo;s a thought echoed by Thakkar. &ldquo;Expanding into smaller towns and cities means you offer much wider coverage to advertisers. If you don&rsquo;t have a presence, you will lose to your competitor,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It is this confidence that is driving ENIL&rsquo;s ambitions: it aims to double profit and revenue in the next three to five years and increase its revenue share from non-tier 1 cities from the current 33% to 50% over the same period. Panday is already looking beyond phase III. He&rsquo;s counting on the benefits that will accrue if the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India&rsquo;s recommendation of halving the gap between frequencies to 400 kHz is accepted &mdash; that could lead to metros having 10-15 FM stations each. &ldquo;Imagine the programming options we could create to attract advertisers. We could have two or three different formats in English music, vernacular shows &mdash; Marathi in Mumbai, Punjabi in Delhi &mdash; radio talk shows, etc. These could be monetised by making sure the new channels target new audiences,&rdquo; he says. That&rsquo;s a long way away, but if it happens, Radio Mirchi will certainly be &ldquo;always <em>khush</em>&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>', 'Why Entertainment Network India''s Radio Mirchi is profitable when other FM radio companies are still struggling', '11', '', 0, '', 'going-gaga-over-radio-157', 152, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Going gaga over radio', 'Why Entertainment Network India''s Radio Mirchi is profitable when other FM radio companies are still struggling', '', '', '', 'Radio Mirchi,Red FM,Big FM,Spectrum auction', 0, NULL, '2015-01-20 14:42:10', '2015-01-20 15:23:31', '2014-04-12', 0),

(159, 20, '', 'A good deal, it it?', '<p class="p1">Sanjiv Shah is probably going to be the next go-to man for the government. He just did something unthinkable, creating a novel way for the government to offload its lacklustre shares. Sure, once upon a time public sector companies were a fancied lot, but not anymore. But the Central Public Sector Enterprises Exchange Traded Fund (CPSE ETF) launched by Goldman Sachs last week ended up collecting Rs 850 crore &mdash; no mean amount for an ETF. That is some reward for two years of sustained effort by Shah in carefully crafting the product and getting it to market. Shah pioneered ETFs in India through his fund, Benchmark, which was bought over by Goldman Sachs in 2011.</p>\n<p class="p3">Predictably, CPSE ETF&rsquo;s substantial collection came purely because of near-term incentives that the government made possible. The fund offered investors an instant discount as the government agreed to sell its shares to the fund at a 5% discount to market price. For investors in the initial offering, there is also the promise of a loyalty bonus of one share for every 15 shares held. This is in addition to the tax savings under RGESS. &ldquo;The fund has been a hit with strong collections both from institutional and retail investors, with nearly 40% coming from the former,&rdquo; says Dhirendra Kumar, CEO, Value Research, a Delhi-based mutual fund tracking agency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s also a matter of good timing. Currently, there is great expectation that Narendra Modi will come to power and, if that happens, the pace of divestment will accelerate. Even otherwise, the poor fiscal deficit leaves the government with no option but to divest its stakes to partly plug the yawning gap. Although additional share supply into the market should actually temper prices, historically, that&rsquo;s not the way stocks have behaved in India. Perversely, divestments have always spurred upside in stocks, albeit only temporarily.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>The energy dose- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Although the stocks in the index are not lousy, non-performing state-owned companies, they are not stocks that offer robust growth in earnings, either. The CPSE index is hugely tilted towards the energy sector, with ONGC constituting 26% of the index. &ldquo;Still, these companies are fundamentally sound and are trading at historic lows,&rdquo; says Kumar. Those lows, however, don&rsquo;t mean much because there&rsquo;s a reason for them. Interest in PSU shares has been continuously on the decline either because these companies are in regulated sectors or they are unable to hold up against private competition in their respective segments. Both put questions marks on the future.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While the government benefits from the scheme as it has an additional channel to offload its shares at a time when investors are becoming increasingly demanding and having taken the bait, creating these artificial incentives is fraught with complications. Institutional investors are savvy and may understand how to time entry and exit, but retail investors run the risk of losing the plot completely. Kumar says if investors have made an informed choice about the incentives, they won&rsquo;t be disappointed. He is also equally firm that the product may not see sustained interest once the incentives with the initial offer are no longer available. That had better be the case because if the scheme becomes a norm, it will only distort markets.&nbsp;</p>', 'Retail investors may rue jumping into CPSE ETF', '11', '', 0, '', 'a-good-deal-it-it-159', 154, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'A good deal, it it?', 'Retail investors may rue jumping into CPSE ETF', '', '', '', 'CPSE,ETF', 0, NULL, '2015-01-20 15:22:25', NULL, '2014-04-12', 0);

(160, 20, '', 'Byte into this', '<p class="p1">If the 1980s and 1990s were all about queues of students eager to sign up for multi-year courses, the millennium has been about potential owners lining up at Aptech. Founded in 1986 by Atul Nishar, the computer training institute that along with NIIT defined the space has changed hands several times in the past decade. In 2003, Nishar sold out to Chennai-based IT training company SSI, the brainchild of serial investor Kalpathi S Suresh. Two years later, billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and his family, along with Ramesh Damani and Asit Koticha, picked up a 32.19% stake in Aptech at #56 per share. And in 2010, Jhunjhunwala picked up a further 2.24% for about Rs 8 crore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Aptech would have had a fourth owner in 2012 had Jhunjhunwala&rsquo;s plans to sell his stake come through. The ace investor had even hired Avendus Capital to scout for prospective suitors and a couple of private equity investors and companies, such as Core Education &amp; Technologies and Team Lease, did express interest, but walked away without making a bid due to a valuation mismatch. At the time, Aptech&rsquo;s promoters were said to be looking for a valuation of over Rs 600-700 crore, while the mar<span class="s1">ket didn&rsquo;t think the company was worth more than Rs 460 crore. Still, the company has a good chance of changing hands again, given its promoter now is a financial investor, not an IT industry hand. But while it remains a zero-debt company with the core business continuing to bring in cash, there are a few concerns regarding some investments the company has made that analysts believe Aptech needs to address for a possible re-rating.</span></p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Beyond bits and bytes</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">Over the years, Aptech has evolved into much more than a computer training institute that taught teens just out of school how to code, although it still remains the No.2 player in that space, after NIIT. In 1996, it branched off to offer animation and multimedia courses under the Arena brandname. Another decade later, it acquired training solutions provider Avalon and started training people in travel and aviation, and after acquiring First English in 2009, added English learning centres to its portfolio. In 2010, it paid Rs 76 crore to acquire Maya Academy of Advanced Cinematics (MAAC), promoted by Bollywood director Ketan Mehta and Deepa Sahi, and was instantly catapulted to pole position in the multimedia and animation training space with a market share of 80%. Currently, more than 70% of the company&rsquo;s Rs 169-crore revenue comes from animation, multimedia and computer training.</p>\n<p class="p7">And not just from India. Of Aptech&rsquo;s 1,300 centres, nearly 500 are overseas, with the company having a presence in 40 countries, including Nigeria, Afghanistan, Russia, Philippines and Mexico. It is the leader in some Asian markets such as Vietnam and Pakistan and has a 35% share in China. Aptech is betting on its international business to drive growth in the next couple of years: over the next two years, the company has set itself a target of getting half its revenue from the overseas market, compared with the current contribution of around 40%. But operating in these markets can be quite a challenge. &ldquo;International markets are difficult markets to operate in because it takes time to scale up operations. But since we understand the career education space rather well, we are able to offer the right courses based on the skill gap and requirement of the recruiters,&rdquo; says Ninad Karpe, MD and CEO, Aptech. He adds that content is localised depending on the skill levels of the students and the recruiter&rsquo;s requirements. Aptech has also got placement teams in India and overseas who work with recruiters to help students with jobs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7"><strong>Making magic- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">While the retail business quite naturally accounts for the lion&rsquo;s share of Aptech&rsquo;s revenue, the company also has a thriving enterprise business that currently contributes 20% to the topline. Under this, it offers corporate training and content to companies. It also provides online testing services for courses and corporate clients. This includes entrance exams such as CMAT and certification tests, as well as screening tests for company recruitments. This is a growing business segment, as many companies have moved from paper-based to computer-based tests for preliminary screening of candidates and the activity is often outsourced to optimise hiring time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7">In FY13, Aptech conducted 1.81 million tests compared with 1.55 million tests the previous year on the back of increased acceptance of online tests. The company conducted the CMAT exam for over 130,000 students at 124 centres across 62 cities in the country over a period of five days and has won the contract to conduct the exams this year as well. The enterprise business will help immensely in Aptech&rsquo;s non-linear growth, says Karpe. &ldquo;As more and more companies adopt online testing, our margins in this business will improve as online testing is a volume game. More tests will lead to better margins,&rdquo; he explains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7"><strong>Upping the stakes- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">Operating margins improved in FY13 to 15.78% from 13.86% even as revenue declined marginally from Rs 174 crore to Rs 169 crore. The drop in revenue came after Aptech realigned revenue recognition of MAAC in line with the rest of the company: while Aptech recognises revenue based on collection, MAAC recognised its revenues on an accrual basis.</p>\n<p class="p7">Aptech follows an asset-light model where, barring some 20-odd centres, all are franchised. It provides the content, training to trainers and oversees quality control, while the franchisee makes the investment, typically in the range of Rs 10 lakh to Rs 80 lakh, depending on the location, size of centre and the brand. Aptech gets about 20% of the revenue generated. The advantage with this model is that the company can scale up without making heavy investments. &ldquo;In an asset-light model like ours, the more you leverage, the better your margins are. We can grow without adding to costs in the same proportion,&rdquo; says Karpe. In FY14, the company has added 103 new centres so far and is looking to add 100 centres in the next year, where 50 of those centres will be in India and the balance will be overseas.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Reboot required</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">So much for the good news. Aptech also has its fair share of challenges to overcome. For starters, there is increasing competition in the education technology space. And that, not surprisingly, eats into the demand for computer education companies such as Aptech and NIIT. &ldquo;Aptech has to contend with universities now getting on the online platform and offering e-learning courses, which increases the options available to students today,&rdquo; says Deepak Agrawal, founder, Impetus Advisors. For its part, the company is not too perturbed by the increasing availability of content. &ldquo;Our biggest advantage is the content we have developed over the past two decades. Once we see a robust revenue model on the emerging platforms, we will be quick to adopt it,&rdquo; says Karpe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7"><strong>"Aptech now has to contend with universities getting on the online platform, offering e-learning courses" - Deepak Agrawal, founder, Impetus Advisors</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">Also, growth rates in the IT services business have become more sedate. &ldquo;The career education space, especially in the IT sector, has gone through a structural change in the last two and a half decades,&rdquo; says G Chokkalingam, founder, Equinomics Research &amp; Advisory. He points out that exports have grown from a mere couple of billion dollars in the early 1990s to over $80 billion now. &ldquo;In the process, the growth rate of IT exports tapered off and hence, education companies focused on IT training started seeing tapering in their growth curve,&rdquo; he adds. But with the market opportunity for the informal education space that Aptech operates in pegged at over $1 billion in India, there is more than enough headroom for the company to grow.</p>\n<p class="p7"><strong>Anaemic returns- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">More worrying is the lack of clarity in Aptech&rsquo;s Chinese operations. The company entered China in 2000 with a joint venture with Beida Jade Bird (BJB), which is affiliated to Beijing University. In 2009, Aptech divested its 50% stake in the joint venture and invested the proceeds (Rs 108 crore) in the holding company, BJB Career Education (BJBC). Currently, the Indian company holds 22.4% in BJBC, but instead of revenue, gets only dividends &mdash; and that, too, is not always consistent. In FY13, the company did not receive any dividend unlike the previous year where it received Rs 50.38 crore. &ldquo;There is no clarity on Aptech&rsquo;s Chinese operations since it does not divulge the revenue figures so it becomes difficult to value that part of the business. The company would be better off hiving off the investment as it would improve the return ratios significantly,&rdquo; says Agrawal. At the end of FY13, Aptech&rsquo;s return on net worth stood at 9.44% while the return on capital employed was at 8.56%. That is rather low for a company where the core business is generating good cash flows.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>The bottomline</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">In 2013, in a bid to improve its returns and earnings per share, Aptech announced a buyback of its shares. Of the Rs 64 crore set aside for this, the company used up Rs 60.19 crore, that is, 94% of what it had targeted, to buy nearly 8.9 million shares. (Incidentally, Jhunjhunwala&rsquo;s stake stands at 42.76%, post the buyback.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7">When the company announced the buyback, it had about Rs 120 crore on its balance sheet, which it did not require for its daily operations. That money was used for the buyback. Post the transactions, Aptech&rsquo;s capital will reduce by 18%, improving its earnings per share and return ratios. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7"><strong>"Spurring growth, especially from outside India, will act as a trigger for re-rating of the stock" - G Chokkalingam, founder, Equinomics Research &amp; Advisory</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">The education space in India is garnering a lot of attention from PE funds and overseas players who are looking to enter the country. As one of the leading players in this space, Aptech will definitely be on their radar, especially since the company is focusing on its presence in the international market, in addition to the domestic market. &ldquo;Spurring growth, especially from regions outside India, will act as a major trigger for re-rating of the stock.&rdquo; says Chokkalingam. The stock has gained 67% over the past one year compared with a Sensex return of 12% during the same period. Over the same period, its competitor and market leader, NIIT, gained 33%. Currently, the Aptech stock trades at 11X its FY14 earnings. &ldquo;The asset-light business model and its debt-free stats are its strong points. Considering the diversified business model across regions and verticals, my view is that Aptech is a good long-term bet,&rdquo; says Chokkalingam. Currently, the stock is trading at a premium of 6% to the average buyback price of Rs 67.50. That should be the new floor for the stock and the upside, of course, will depend on how ambitious Jhunjhunwala gets.&nbsp;</p>', 'Why Aptech is a good bet (Hint: there''s more to the company than its recent buyback)', '6', '', 0, '', 'byte-into-this-160', 155, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Byte into this', 'Why Aptech is a good bet (Hint: there''s more to the company than its recent buyback)', '', '', '', 'Aptech,NIIT,Computer training', 0, NULL, '2015-01-20 15:27:48', '2015-01-20 15:59:10', '2014-04-12', 0),
(161, 12, '', 'Ronald McDonald, we have company', '<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At</span>&nbsp;the Indiabulls Finance Centre &amp; One Indiabulls Centre on Mumbai&rsquo;s Senapati Bapat Road, the lights have been staying on later than usual on the 10<sup>th</sup> floor of Tower 3 and the 16<sup>th</sup> floor of Tower 2A respectively. In these adjacent high rises, a couple of boardrooms have been a beehive of activity. One is the market leader by miles and the second, an unpretentious contender not only in the Indian market which it has just entered but also in its home base where it is a distant second. Even from an overall perspective, its 13,000 outlets seem puny compared with the leader which has 14,000 in the US alone. This heft is also reflected in a market cap of $92 billion compared with the contender&rsquo;s $12 billion <em>(see: Who&rsquo;s your daddy)</em>. Tower 3 is home to the offices of Hardcastle Restaurants, the development licensee (West and South India) for McDonald&rsquo;s Corporation while Tower 2A houses Everstone Capital, a private equity firm which is the master franchisee for Burger King in India. For now, Burger King India, too, works out of the Everstone office. By the time you are reading this, both will be fiercely competing less than a mile away at High Street Phoenix, a high footfall retail destination in Mumbai. The irony is that they will literally be within shouting distance at many of the high-profile locations. Given their overlapping target market, is such an in the face presence a source of worry for McDonald&rsquo;s India?</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>GRAPHIC: Who''s your daddy</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Hardly so, feels Amit Jatia, vice-chairman, Westlife Development, the listed entity which houses Hardcastle Restaurants. &ldquo;They are opening a few restaurants. We have 350, for them to make an impact in India; they first need to get a 100. We like to compete when a brand is right next to us as that is when the differentiation stands out. As nobody has a location advantage, it boils down to execution. Somebody coming next to us at the mall doesn&rsquo;t matter to us.&rdquo; That is not cockiness but ground reality from someone whose brand has single handedly grown the category and made burgers a much familiar item of consumption in India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Informal eating out is a $90 billion market and growing at about 10% a year. Within that, western fast food is growing at 15% a year and the organised sector&rsquo;s share is about a billion dollars. Given a turnover of about #1,500 crore in India, McDonald&rsquo;s roughly has a 25% market share of the organised sector. This heft has been created through nearly two decades of patient investment.&nbsp; When further pressed about the advantages and disadvantages that late comers such as Burger King enjoy, Jatia shares, &ldquo;The biggest advantage for a new comer is that there is a supply chain in place. The disadvantage is there is a very strong global leader. Business is not just about opening doors. Enough restaurants have opened their doors in India. Competitive advantage comes from real estate, supply chain and customer connect. It is not that easy a thing to put together.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Paving the path&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">To the uninitiated, this may again come across as self boast. But speak to almost anyone in the industry and there is unanimity about the role that McDonald&rsquo;s India has played in developing a reliable supply chain in the country. Post its entry, McDonald&rsquo;s worked directly with farmers to address its requirements. Samar Gupta, director, Trikaya Agriculture was among the first to work with McDonald&rsquo;s as it went about building its sourcing network. The company supported him in growing superior lettuce and he ended up as its biggest supplier of fresh iceberg lettuce in its earlier years. He stopped supplying to McDonald&rsquo;s as he wanted to focus on being an exotic agro boutique rather than a mass supplier as margins are better in the former. His reminiscence, &ldquo;McDonald&rsquo;s brought in a new level of intensity to sourcing. When their people visited the farm, it was serious business for them. For most five-star hotels that we supply to, it is still more of a picnic when they come down to my farm.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Gupta also adds that while many organisations talk about best practices, 90% of them are just talk. &ldquo;In one of the sandwich chains that I used to supply to, because of its franchised model, it clearly used to be a free for all. In some cases, lettuce was chopped right off the floor. McDonald&rsquo;s is a stickler for processes unlike at the other chains where a lot of them just went by the supplier&rsquo;s word. McDonald&rsquo;s tested everything, including for residue.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>"McDonald&rsquo;s is a stickler for processes unlike at other chains where they go by the supplier&rsquo;s word"-&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>Samar Gupta,&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Director, Trikaya Agriculture</em></strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Given its early mover advantage and deep processes, couldn&rsquo;t McDonald&rsquo;s have created an entry barrier by opting for exclusive sourcing arrangements with all its suppliers? Well, turns out it is not the parent&rsquo;s policy to do so. Jatia says, &ldquo;We do handshakes with suppliers, not agreements. Our French fries come from the same supplier who sells to everybody else but McDonald&rsquo;s French fries are McDonald&rsquo;s French fries. That is because we have proprietary potatoes and processes.&rdquo; This level of supplier trust is something that Gupta clearly remembers as well. &ldquo;They were very comfortable letting suppliers mingle among themselves unlike a typical Indian mindset where you would want to keep them apart for fear of them discussing what each of them was paid,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>GRAPHIC:&nbsp;Operating on a web of trust</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Many, who came in later have ridden on the back of the supply chain put in place by McDonald&rsquo;s. Gupta cites the almost year round availability of lettuce. &ldquo;Because McDonald&rsquo;s popularised lettuce, now a lot of farms in Ooty grow it, so availability is not an issue.&rdquo; The current situation is a far cry from the day when McDonald&rsquo;s had a stock out situation and had to use cabbage. Since that was unacceptable, the unhappy experience led them to plan for future stock out scenarios (<em>see: Round-the-clock delivery</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>GRAPHIC: Round-the-clock delivery</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Burger King, too, might rely on the usual suspects for supplies as it goes about expanding in India. And while a lot of strategy might get discussed in the boardroom and one can hype up one&rsquo;s arrival on social media, the honchos at Burger King are aware that the moment of truth is when the customer troops in and tries out the Indian whopper, be it chicken, mutton or vegetarian. Burger King might be the newest kid on the burger block but Rajeev Varman who runs it in India is a Burger King veteran. He used to run Burger King&rsquo;s operations in the UK earlier and it is now upon him to deliver a whopper of a presence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Burger King&rsquo;s approach to the Indian market is at odds compared to what it is doing in the home market. Out there it not only franchises but is also actively selling its owned stores in favour of an asset light model. In India, not only has it agreed to a minority stake but is also going to operate its own stores. This test-the-waters approach on the part of 3G Capital, the aggressive owner of Burger King, seems to suggest that they wouldn&rsquo;t be averse to walking away if the numbers don&rsquo;t show up in the desired timeframe. 3G is known to run a very tight ship and one needs to see how patient they are willing to be in&nbsp;a deep duration market like India. Burger King India&rsquo;s point of view could not be obtained as despite repeated attempts, they did not respond after having asked for a questionnaire.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While the intent is to open about 12 outlets in the next three months, Varman was quoted by Reuters as saying, &ldquo;In India, we will set up our first few restaurants and use that to fine-tune our operating model before determining our growth plans.&rdquo; Burger King&rsquo;s choice of partner Everstone is also interesting. Everstone is helping out with stores where the initial outlets are coming up. For instance, the High Street Phoenix outlet earlier housed Spaghetti Kitchen; a brand owned by Blue Foods, which itself is controlled by Everstone, ditto for its first outlet at Select Citywalk Mall in Delhi. There, too, a Spaghetti Kitchen made way for a Burger King. Even from an equity partner&rsquo;s perspective, if the venture gathers critical mass for 3G&rsquo;s comfort, it could very well buy Everstone out. But that for now is the equivalent of wishing for the moon from terra firma.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Burger King has a very long way to compete before it enjoys some semblance of recall in the Indian market which has its own idiosyncrasies in terms of perception not to mention taste. Jatia recalls the experience of his early days. Cleanliness and value are prime planks on which McDonald&rsquo;s operates and that is what it put into practice when it entered India. &ldquo;We built spick and span restaurants for our customers which offered affordably priced meals. But the neat look of the restaurants itself ended up becoming a barrier as customers thought it must be expensive and one should be well dressed to get in,&rdquo;&nbsp;says Jatia. The company changed that through advertising about the fun nature of the brand and emphasising that it was easy on the pocket.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Matter of taste</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">While that perception issue was addressed by imagery, getting the taste right in a diverse market like India is a herculean task (<em>see: Give me Red</em>). After the first bite, the challenge is getting the right word of mouth. It is a test that will be faced not only by Burger King but all the other new burger chains that have entered or plan to venture into India. Among those already here include Johnny Rockets as well as Fatburger and in the pipeline are Carl&rsquo;s Jr., Wendy&rsquo;s and Dairy Queen. Johnny Rockets currently has three outlets up and running. Prime Gourmet, the master franchisee for Johnny Rockets, decided to take no chances and drafted noted chef Bakshish Dean on board. But that did not prevent their original vegetarian offering, a soya patty, from crashing off the menu. Since then Dean has consistently worked to Indianise Johnny Rockets&rsquo; offerings to suit the Indian palate. He details, &ldquo;The primary challenge was to make a bridge between international flavours and what the palate in India wants. One outcome is a vegetarian burger called Ultimate Veggie. It has a European style flavouring yet connects with the Indian palate that likes garlic, thyme and oregano. When you bite into it, it is 85% vegetables unlike other vegetable patties which is primarily potato with specks of vegetables. We upped the seasoning a bit, added a hint of spice and it has worked very well for us.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>GRAPHIC: Give me red</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Like Jatia, Dean has had his own share of surprises in a market that has a high vegetarian population. McDonald&rsquo;s today sells 1.5 chicken burgers for every one vegetarian burger. Even during Burger King&rsquo;s pre-booking offer in the north in the run-up to its launch, the biggest preference displayed was for chicken burgers, then mutton and vegetarian. As for Dean&rsquo;s shocker, &ldquo;Our highest selling burger is called Houston whether in chicken, tenderloin or vegetarian builds. It is an actual Johnny Rockets recipe and we haven&rsquo;t changed it at all. But we clearly did not expect a demand ratio of 60% tenderloin and 40% chicken when we started off.&nbsp; Now it has settled at 55% chicken and 45% tenderloin.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Jay Singh&rsquo;s experience at the high end, though, has a twist. He is the co-founder of JSM Corp, which has straddled the entire spectrum from a nightspot to fine dining. His experience running casual dining brands such as Hard Rock Caf&eacute; and California Pizza Kitchen reveal that at the top end there is a distinct vegetarian bias. &ldquo;At our price point, there is more similarity than difference between the consumer here and the other parts of the world. Of the top five, at least two or three menu preferences will be in the top five globally. However, vegetarian offerings with high-end ingredients account for 50% to 60% of our sales.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While Carl&rsquo;s Jr. is working on a 60% vegetarian and 40% chicken menu for its launch next year, Sam Chopra, chairman, CybizCorp, which is getting the brand into India, says, &ldquo;Outside of a Wednesday or Sunday, many Indians are vegetarians either by religion or personal choice.&rdquo; He also says that in India, most people consider burger to be healthy and pizza to be unhealthy. &ldquo;Pizza has much visible cheese and burger has salad and the option of whole wheat bread which can be dressed down a low calorie burger. The fried patty can be replaced by chargrilled, which we will do,&rdquo; he adds. Burger King, too, will offer flame-grilled patties and is bringing its own menu innovations such as mutton burger and vegetarian options like Spicy Bean Royale, Paneer King Melt and Veg Chilli Cheese Melt.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>"Outside of a Wednesday or Sunday, many Indians are vegetarians either by religion or personal choice" -</strong>&nbsp;<strong><em>Sam Chopra,&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Chairman, CybizCorp</em></strong></p>\n<p class="p3">While Jatia doesn&rsquo;t rule out the chances of McDonald&rsquo;s launching a mutton burger, he says it is remote. He elaborates, &ldquo;We started with the mutton burger in 1996-1997. There are supply chain constraints in mutton and limited interest and we found the chicken platform to be more standard. We recently launched a mutton burger in Australia. We keep bringing things from the globe. If we find that consumers are favouring it, we may or may not bring it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Building it right</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">McDonald&rsquo;s massive size and reach does lead to a lot of cross learning but it is not all smooth sailing for the Golden Arches as it is dealing with turmoil back home as well as in India. Its overall sales have continued to plummet this year as niche burger chains such as Shake Shack and Five Guys continue to roll in the dough. The parent&rsquo;s Q3 topline and profit also took a hit due to increased competition in its home market (Chipotle that it had funded and held equity in earlier, is growing faster and now has a market cap of $20 billion), the food scare in China and Putin hitting back in Russia by closing down 9 outlets and citing health and hygiene violations continues to investigate more than 200 others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In India, it is sparring with its partner in the North and East. The exact genesis of the dispute between the parent and Connaught Plaza Restaurants is still not clear. Vikram Bakshi did not respond to questions on what exactly triggered off the current state of affairs nor elaborated on his contribution in establishing McDonald&rsquo;s in the areas that he earlier used to oversee. Hearsay varies from Bakshi alleging preferential treatment to Jatia&rsquo;s Hardcastle Restaurants to allegations of impropriety on Bakshi&rsquo;s part. Left to itself, the US parent would want Bakshi out of its cross hairs, so that it can protect and grow its business in the North and East market. Already, Burger King has chosen Delhi as it launch market and so have a lot of other burger chains like Johnny Rockets, Carl&rsquo;s Jr. and Fatburger among others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There is enough launch buzz now to get footfalls in for Burger King but to manage that on a sustained basis in the current economic climate has been challenging for Jatia as well. Same store sales have been falling and <br /> for the first half of the current financial year his company reported nearly a #15 crore loss compared to a profit of about #3 crore in the same period last year&nbsp;(<em>see: Investing to grow</em>).</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>GRAPHIC: Investing to grow</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The current red ink does not bother Jatia much as he says he is building for the future and this temporary trough is well understood by his investors. &ldquo;Every new restaurant I build, I lose money. So my P&amp;L is only going to get worse. My investors understand that it is an operating leverage business. I started my first restaurant in 1996 but the first time we made money was in 2009. That time we were privately held, so nobody cared. As we now start scaling again, there is twin pressure. Cost pressure and new stores are taking away our profits and in the old stores, same store sales are negative,&rdquo; he explains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Jatia is aiming for a critical mass of 500 to 1,000 restaurants and is opening 30 to 40 stores a year. As he expands, his pet theme is broadening accessibility, which translates to being accessible and affordable to customers. He explains, &ldquo;We just opened a restaurant in Vasai. Previously they had to drive 30 minutes. By going close to them, they will build McDonald&rsquo;s into their life. I also need to be affordable. Then you will visit more often, you will eat more often. We have played a significant role in moving the eating out frequency from 3 in 2003 to 8 times a month now in Mumbai If a restaurant in Kalyan (a far flung Mumbai suburb) does as well as the one at Crossroads (India&rsquo;s first mall at South Mumbai) that is because they can afford it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">To this, Singh adds a word of caution. He reminds, &ldquo;Low prices are not sustainable as costs are not going down. So, something has to give. You lower prices with the assumption that your economies of scale are going to kick in and you can become more and more efficient to sustain that price. Those are untested assumptions.&rdquo; Asked if he has considered a price hike to offset input costs, Jatia answers, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t react in a knee-jerk manner in matters of pricing. So, if my input costs have suddenly gone up, I need to absorb it and maintain consistency. Menu prices can take half the pressure and the other half we will extract through productivity growth at the suppliers end.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>"Low prices are not sustainable as costs are not going down. So, something has to give" -&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>Jay Singh,&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Co-founder, JSM Corp</em></strong></p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Keep them coming &nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Unlike Jatia, who is banking on scale, Vishal Chaudhry at Johnny Rockets does not have that pressure. For a Johnny Rockets or Singh&rsquo;s Hard Rock Caf&eacute; for that matter hitting 150 outlets is not the driver. Given the limited capital, being profitable as early as possible is. In fact, the very reason that Prime Gourmet decided to go with Johnny Rockets was because there was flexibility in terms of format and menu localisation. &ldquo;We have the flexibility to go into a location like Ambience Mall, which is 2,500 square feet with 92 covers or Select City, which is 1,500 square feet. Our sweet spot is 60 covers but we can go down to 40. This flexibility allows us to balance footfall, rentals and the overall business model,&rdquo; says Chaudhry as the servers break into their regular dance routine, a Johnny Rockets differentiator.</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>"Our sweet spot is 60 covers but we can go down to 40, which allows us to balance footfall and rentals" -&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>Vishal Chaudhry (L),&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Director, Prime Gourmet</em></strong></p>\n<p class="p2">As you look around the Johnny Rockets outlet at Gurgaon&rsquo;s Ambience Mall during the weekday lunch hour, many notions about India&rsquo;s eating habits get dismantled. With classics from the 60s, 70s and the 80s wafting in the background, Johnny Rockets is supposed to be an American Diner where the typical demographic should be expatriates wanting to feel at home, tourists looking for familiar eating spots or the well travelled looking for a genuine burger experience or working executives. While you do have all of the above, also in tow with their parents are kids and at a faraway table teenagers with their grandparents. Despite this diverse patron profile, Gaurav Sharma, director, Prime Gourmet, says, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t consider ourselves competing with a McDonald&rsquo;s. It is a different price point. We consider our competition to be casual dining chains like Chili&rsquo;s, Nando&rsquo;s or Big Chill. People who prefer us don&rsquo;t want to spend thousands on fine dining but don&rsquo;t either want to go to a McDonald&rsquo;s and have a QSR kind of experience.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The 70% to 80% weekday occupancy at Johnny Rocket&rsquo;s biggest outlet is heartening but Singh thinks hyper growth will take its time coming as the industry tackles affordability issues and eating habits. He says he agrees with Yum India&rsquo;s President, Niren Chaudhary&rsquo;s assessment about India being a case of &lsquo;first world cost, third world pricing&rsquo;. &ldquo;Our cost structure in the industry is becoming close to what it is in the West and the pricing power is probably 30% of what prevails there,&rdquo; he points out. With respect to food habits, he says, Indians like things that fill them up. That is why wraps of different kinds sell. In Chinese food, there is a clear preference for things to be saucy and gravy. &ldquo;In India, the appetisers are dry but the main course is always gravy or curry. If you really want to expand, you got to address that, &ldquo;he says. Hence, the only way out, he says, for mass players is to localise their offering and aggressively sweat their assets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Singh&rsquo;s prescription has already been swallowed by a lot of QSR players. KFC is offering a rice bowl. Even at Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts, it is the more (burgers and sandwiches) that is selling more. McDonald&rsquo;s is also working on filling up its restaurants in the slack hours by reaching out through different formats, be it through breakfast options, McCafe, online delivery or a Drive-thru.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Jatia is banking on McCafe and wraps to reverse the decline in same store sales. &ldquo;We have 27 McCafe compared with zero last October and plan to ramp up to 75 by end of next year. McCafe gets me into your consideration set if you are a regular coffee drinker. Then there is wraps as it has a roti feel. Customers are increasingly buying it with a meal. So, we will play with more choice and options there. Then there is the flatbread option in case you want something different from the bun option.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">So, will all this be enough to help McDonald&rsquo;s India grow and protect its turf? Jatia grabs this opportunity to pull out his trump card, &ldquo;There is a whole generation that has grown up with us. Kids and teens have celebrated birthday parties at McDonald&rsquo;s. People like to click their pictures with Ronald McDonald. You can&rsquo;t take away that brand connect or nostalgia.&rdquo; Well, that is certainly true. Parents don&rsquo;t go to McDonald&rsquo;s, their kids drag them there. And if the grown-ups drag the kids into Burger King for a curiosity visit, &lsquo;doesn&rsquo;t feel like McD&rsquo; is the last thing the guys in Tower 2A would like to hear. Kids may not be their core market but pester power is a killer multiplier.

(163, 24, '', 'The Tao of finance', '<p class="p1">At 14, Nandan Chakraborty had it all worked out. The hours spent poring over Isaac Asimov&rsquo;s work in the school library had convinced him of a career as a nuclear scientist. After a peer-pressure fed detour to IIT Kharagpur and an &ldquo;accidental MBA&rdquo; from IIM Calcutta, four decades on, Chakraborty is completely at ease as the managing director of institutional equity research at Axis Capital. But what has remained unchanged is his unconditional love for music and a hard-to-get-rid-of reading habit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">As the only child in a traditional Bengali family, Chakraborty picked up music quite early, honing his guitar skills during his stint at IIT. &ldquo;We would often make our way to Calcutta from Kharagpur and watch local bands practise and play there,&rdquo; he says. But the best of western classic rock was not the only thing to catch his attention at college &mdash; Chakraborty also developed a taste for philosophy, religion and psychology and breezed through college mainstays such as Camus, Sartre, Rand and Kafka. This was also when he learnt his earliest lessons on intersectionality between domains, plodding through tomes such as <em>The Tao of Physics</em> and <em>Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">After enriching stints at Eicher, Philips and HCL, Chakraborty eventually moved to Australia at the worst possible time &mdash; during the global economic trough around 1990. At a time when most others were struggling to get good jobs, Chakraborty managed to charm his way through interviews just a week after setting foot in the southern hemisphere. &ldquo;I realised that I had nothing to lose and so was almost fearless. This no-risk philosophy worked and got me a job with Unisys Corporation.&rdquo; A chance encounter with a stock exchange senior got him to sign up for a course in finance with the Securities Institute there, and there has been no looking back since. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Chakraborty says his voracious reading and interest in varied fields of thought have given him a well-rounded world-view, vital in research. &ldquo;As the head of research at an equity firm, I need to have unbiased views. The analysts I work with are highly specialised in their fields and I can only help them by showing them their blind spots and making them look at things differently. This ensures that we never get blindsided.&rdquo; And makes them prescient as well &mdash; an October 2008 Axis Capital report correctly predicted a 74% Sensex surge at a time when the global economy was down in the dumps.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;This ability to see how things can change comes from my exposure across fields and interactions with musicians, writers, all kinds of creative people,&rdquo; he adds. And he intends to keep the process going. &ldquo;I try to imbibe a bit of reading every day because you never know when it might come handy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Indeed, as he realised during a pep talk with one of his analysts. &ldquo;I told him about how we have learnt through evolutionary biology that the failure of the first amphibians to tough it out in the ocean led to the eventual creation of man; how the failure of mammals to tower over other creatures ensured their survival in the calamity that wiped out the bigger dinosaurs; and how a single monkey being ostracised from the pack led to his survival in the grasslands and his transformation into man. So, as humans, we are successors of failure, and there is no reason to be disheartened by it; instead, it should fuel our appetite for risk.&rdquo; Perhaps, the most fitting attitude in the stock-eat-stock world of personal finance.<span class="s3"><br /></span></p>', 'Axis Capital''s institutional equity research MD Nandan Chakraborty on what his love for philosophy and music taught him about equities', '12', '', 0, '', 'the-tao-of-finance-163', 158, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'The Tao of finance', 'Axis Capital''s institutional equity research MD Nandan Chakraborty on what his love for philosophy and music taught him about equities', '', '', '', 'Axis Capital Insitutional Equity Research,Nandan Chakraborty,Music', 0, NULL, '2015-01-20 16:21:16', NULL, '2014-04-12', 0),
(164, 24, '', 'Bottoms up', '<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s been creeping up insidiously and has grown in recent times to a shocker that seems to have the masculine gene map cross-wired. As women continue to break glass ceilings and empower themselves with dark business suits, men, it now appears, are veering almost naturally towards what were considered effeminate colours. &ldquo;I love a man who has the confidence to wear pink,&rdquo; women were known to flirt a few years ago, when it seemed that everyone was outing their shelves to show off candy floss and mauve-coloured shirts saved up for weekends. But all that is in the past. Men no longer just wear pink &mdash; and mauve and lemon and violet &mdash; they wear it with insouciance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">And it&rsquo;s not just shirts. The biggest trend on the tube in London (which is the most democratic platform you&rsquo;re likely to find for working professionals) is coloured pants for men, and the public loves it! From red pants to purples and greens to fuchsia and rouge, it is soft power all the way. But it shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise. Tomato red pants are a common feature in the spring collections of fashion biggies Hugo Boss, Topman and Zara. The striking palette doesn&rsquo;t find resonance in women&rsquo;s clothes, so clearly this is a masculine trend, and one which doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s going anywhere in a hurry.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">And now that the Corneliani catalogue is out, it&rsquo;s no surprise that the mandate is set. But what&rsquo;s more surprising is the choice of pinks on offer, which could lead some to think that pink is the new corporate blue for men. Which &mdash; blue, that is &mdash; continues to remain a favourite for jackets and blazers. Once upon a time, you could be forgiven for thinking that heads of department showing up in yellow pants might have led to corporate seizure, but now it&rsquo;s just as likely that the head honcho might be more willing to experiment with colour and cut &mdash; slim fit, naturally &mdash; than would have been possible earlier. With trousers, they are reconciled to the fact that the current wisdom says creative, innovative people dress flamboyantly and think out of the box as compared with their more staid colleagues. Which could be a reason why concessions are being made for people who dress, well, a little differently, and attempts made to embrace that difference.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While the less courageous might prefer to keep those legs tucked under the desk so that not too many visitors can glimpse a crimson pant or a yellow shoe, you can instead focus on keeping shirts and jackets simple and tone down the palette so that corporate summer fashion looks not so much outrageous as quirky.</p>\n<p class="p3">Zara, for a long while, had led the colour revolution, so it doesn&rsquo;t come as a surprise that it continues to cater to that constituency. But Hugo Boss has &lsquo;safari&rsquo; jackets that are a deeper shade of pink this season, while Giorgio Armani has a selection of shirts and jackets in a vivid aquamarine.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The problem is with shoes. You can&rsquo;t really team crimson pants with a pair of black Oxfords. The mandate, therefore, is to eliminate formal shoes and replace them with casual loafers or moccasins. Which is perfect given India&rsquo;s severe summer, but wearing them without socks might prove more challenging than even your coloured pants.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>&mdash;The writer is a Delhi-based author and curator</strong></p>', 'Coloured trousers for men is the first fashion trend of this summer.

This book will strike a chord with practitioners and learners alike. It starts earnestly giving a lucid explanation of &lsquo;fraud&rsquo; in common law and statutes and goes on to dwell on Sebi&rsquo;s regulations, quoting the relevant authorities. One of the interesting things about the book is the extent of research material on corporate fraud jurisprudence that has been quoted.</p>\n<p class="p2">It is also probably the first time the subjects of mis-selling and unsuitability have been dealt with in any book on securities or corporate fraud. In a financial market heading towards the availability of offshore products over the next few years, regulation against mis-selling assumes significance and one would expect for jurisprudence to develop on this topic. While the Indian securities markets have moved to be more disclosure oriented, minimising the information asymmetry, the complexity and the breadth of financial products that could be structured bring forth the need for adequate investor protection against mis-selling.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">The chapters on fraud in the primary markets, mis-statement and on insider trading provide interesting analysis on how the regulations evolved on account of market misdemeanour and how the Securities Appellate Tribunal and the courts have loudly viewed &lsquo;insider trading&rsquo; as a serious securities market offence. The need for the directors and the company secretary to ensure proper governance and disclosure is also brought out in the quoted case laws.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">With the coming into force of the Companies Act, 2013, the responsibilities of directors on governance get enhanced multi-fold. Moreover, Sebi surveillance on listed companies and their actions against insider trading and price manipulation, including the orders against directors on fraudulent practices in IPOs, shows that it is increasingly possible to detect and initiate punitive actions against frauds on investors. This book would be useful to the directors on the board of listed firms and enable them to understand the liabilities that may incur if they aren&rsquo;t vigilant in enforcing compliance with the laws.</p>\n<p class="p2">The book, as its author himself admits, is not intended to be a treatise on the subject but the minimal use of legal jargon and the management approach to understanding law ends up being the highlight of the text.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Insights</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p2"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Saving on sunny days</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1">A penny saved is a penny earned, and no one knows that better than emerging economies in Asia. Researchers <strong>Charles Y Horioka</strong> and <strong>Akiko Terada-Hagiwara</strong> found that improved cash flows had a positive effect on the cash reserves of 11 Asian economies, indicating that companies in these places were saving at a time of plenty in order to fund future growth. However, analysis of the firms surveyed in these economies revealed that the benefits of such a situation are only seen when the firms are smaller in size. The researchers say that one reason for such cash holding behaviour might be the borrowing constraints and the underdeveloped financial sectors in these markets, had it not been for which, most firms would probably opt to invest in physical assets.</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>Title:</strong> Corporate Cash Holding in Asia</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>Source:</strong> The National Bureau of Economic Research</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Voting with your feet</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1">Is an enlightened customer or shareholder always good for a company?

The researchers say that investors holding large blocks of stock may cash in and walk out if they feel that the firm is not doing enough to increase value or capitalise on greater liquidity.

(168, 12, '', 'Origami is on a roll', '<p class="p1">Paperless office? Think again. Increasingly, there&rsquo;s paper in almost every aspect of urban Indian life, whether at office or home&nbsp; &mdash; wet wipes, paper napkins, paper cups and plates, kitchen towels, toilet rolls. It may be the stuff of green crusaders&rsquo; nightmares, but for one Bengaluru-based couple, at least, this urge to reach for the nearest box of tissues is a dream come true. Manoj and Neelam Pachisia are the promoters of Origami India, a Rs 100-crore company that&rsquo;s taken less than a decade to make its mark in the $280-million Indian organised tissue paper market. &ldquo;Until recently, Indians used more of water and not paper for cleaning up. Now, more are switching to paper and with it, our business, too, is picking up steadily,&rdquo; says Manoj Pachisia, CEO, Origami India.</p>\n<p class="p3">The Pachisias didn&rsquo;t start out with any ambitions for the paper products industry. Far from it. An alumnus of IIM Ahmedabad&rsquo;s batch of 1986, Manoj&rsquo;s summer projects with watch companies such as Allwyn and HMT proved so interesting that he decided to not join any company on graduation, and instead started his own watch band factory at Bengaluru, with loans from his family and local financial institutions. Neelam joined the business after marriage, but wanted to try her hand at something else. She got the opportunity in 2004, when the Pachisias&rsquo; neighbours wanted someone to run their paper products factory. &ldquo;I told him that while we may not know anything about paper, we did know how to run a factory,&rdquo; recalls Neelam Pachisia, co-founder. The arrangement continued for a couple of years, but the business was deep in the red &mdash; at which point, the Pachisias decided to take over the entire business. They paid around Rs 16 lakh to buy out their neighbours, renamed the business Origami India and exited the watch band business to focus on this new venture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Changing demographics and increasing earning capacity are leading to more usage of paper products" - VP Leekha, CMD, Pudumjee Pulp and Paper Mills</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">It helped that customer preferences were also changing at the time. As VP Leekha, CMD, Pudumjee Pulp &amp; Paper Mills, points out, &ldquo;Changing demographics and increasing earning capacity is leading to greater usage of paper products. Increasing middle class consumption will drive the growth, going forward.&rdquo; Now, Origami is among the top three players in the market, along with Ballarpur Industries and Wintex, and they together account for nearly 50% value share of the retail tissue paper market. The company produces tissues, wet wipes, toilet tissue rolls, napkins, kitchen towels for retail customers; housekeeping paper products and napkins for institutional customers; kitchen towels, toilet paper and napkins in the private label segment; and matched sets, paper table covers and embossed metallic plates for export to the UK, UAE, Australia and Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>No paper tiger</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">One indicator of Origami&rsquo;s growing scale is the quantity of paper it uses &mdash; from 500 kg a month, it now uses a little over 500 tonne each month, which is processed at five paper converting centres across the country. Most of the paper is sourced from Nagpur, where the company acquired a paper mill two years ago with a capacity of 500 tonne a month. &ldquo;It is difficult to find the right quality of paper in India. With this mill, we have some control over an important factor of production, enabling us to control quality and also bring in some cost benefits,&rdquo; says Pachisia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But the key difference when it comes to manufacturing is that about 80% of Origami&rsquo;s products are manufactured from recycled waste paper in compliance with environmental norms. The manufacturing process involves using a combination of pulp and recycled waste paper or tissue paper. The pulp is pressed and the water drained and steam rolled to dry and the resulting paper is rolled to give it uniform thickness using highly specialised machines. The paper is made in large rolls and then sliced and cut or &lsquo;converted&rsquo; for end uses. While the Pachisias have successfully cracked the manufacturing part of the business, the focus is now beefing up Origami&rsquo;s presence.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Origami India''s products- Picture</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The couple has extended Origami&rsquo;s footprint with sales offices in cities such as Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad, Chandigarh as well as Coimbatore. This move has also helped keep a check on costs &mdash; although paper products are light, they are bulky, making transportation costs prohibitive. &ldquo;With local branches, we are able to restrict transport costs to 8%, thus increasing our distribution while being financially viable,&rdquo; Pachisia explains. On the radar are plans to open multi-location manufacturing plants, but that would entirely depend on how well and soon Origami achieves critical mass.</p>\n<p class="p3">For now, institutional sales to restaurants and catering businesses and corporate offices account for close to half the company&rsquo;s sales (<em>see: What&rsquo;s on paper</em>). Typically, these are signed as annual or bi-annual contracts with clients such as IBM, Google, HP, Infosys, Domino&rsquo;s and Indigo Airlines, where Origami provides branded tissues and other paper products. Origami is also a private label manufacturer for most of the large supermarket chains and supplies products under various store brands such as Kare Mate to Big Bazaar, Arrow to Metro and Everyday to Hypercity. &ldquo;Origami&rsquo;s USP is the huge experience it has in making paper products and its diversified product mix, offering products at various price ranges,&rdquo; points out Vaibhav Anand Gupta, trading head, non food, Hypercity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>What''s on paper- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Now, the company also wants to build its retail business, which currently accounts for 22% of sales. Origami has three primary brands: Godya, named for the earlier proprietor of the business, is a popular brand of tissues in Bengaluru and neighbouring cities; the Klassic brand is reserved for wholesalers; and So Soft, its flagship paper tissues brand. While Godya will continue to remain a regional brand and there are no plans to grow Klassic (since it is a tissue paper product aimed at the lower end of the spectrum), Origami wants to expand So Soft&rsquo;s reach and portfolio and launch party products such as plates and paper table covers under the Origami brand name.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The million dollar question here remains, how it will go about popularising the brand, considering that Origami currently doesn&rsquo;t spend on advertising at all &mdash; its branding and marketing efforts so far have been through in-store promotions and displays. &ldquo;The paper products market in India is underdeveloped and per capita consumption is still under 100 gm, compared with 24 kg in America and 18 kg in Europe. So, advertising doesn&rsquo;t make too much sense for Origami at present,&rdquo; says Pachisia.</p>\n<p class="p3">Going forward, though, the game changer for the Pasichias and their peers in the paper products business will be the government&rsquo;s decision to allow 100% FDI in multi-brand retail. &ldquo;Currently we serve the top 10 cities in India and are not there in tier 3 cities. This move will allow us to have a presence in many of the tier 2 and 3 towns in India,&rdquo; says Pachisia. Pudumjee&rsquo;s Leekha, though, sounds a note of caution. &ldquo;While the FDI move will certainly spur things, the absence of established brands could pose a hindrance,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">For now, Origami is concentrating on expanding its reach to more markets in the North and West of the country, and get more aggressive on selling wet wipes and paper cups. That&rsquo;s what helped it grow at 30% a year in an industry that&rsquo;s clocking 25% growth. The path ahead is challenging for Origami, as its reluctance to advertise negates its biggest advantage against competition &mdash; there isn&rsquo;t a single established brand name player in the paper industry. If the company manages to capitalise on this advantage and popularise paper products enough to raise per capita consumption figures, its growth figures may be noticeable enough to leap off the page. As it stands, however, its business is as good on paper as it is in life.</p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s2">&nbsp;</span></p>', 'How Manoj Pachisia successfully created a national brand in a hyper-competitive domestic paper tissue market — in less than a decade', '11', '', 0, '', 'origami-is-on-a-roll-168', 163, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Origami is on a roll', 'How Manoj Pachisia successfully created a national brand in a hyper-competitive domestic paper tissue market — in less than a decade', '', '', '', 'Origami India,Manoj Pachisia,Ballarpur Industries,Wintex,Paper products,Recycled waste paper', 0, NULL, '2015-01-20 17:59:06', '2015-01-20 18:13:35', '2014-03-15', 0),

Billed as the mother of all sales, Flipkart advertised Big Billion with promises of flash sales across 70 categories, lucky draws every hour and unprecedented offers and discounts. The consumers&rsquo; disappointment, then, was only understandable when not only did the discounts vanish within seconds but, in some cases, prices were hiked hours or days before the sale kicked off.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">The sale soon snowballed into a big PR nightmare, forcing the Bansals to send an apology to the company&rsquo;s customers. &ldquo;We did not live up to the promises we made and for that we are really and truly sorry,&rdquo; the Bansals said in their email. &ldquo;We realise that this breaks the trust our customers have put in us. We are truly sorry for this and will ensure that this never happens again.&rdquo; While Flipkart had deployed over 5,000 servers and entrusted 10,000 field staff with the responsibility of ensuring that deliveries were made on time, things didn&rsquo;t go quite as planned and the company acknowledged that it was not adequately prepared for the scale of the event. &ldquo;To brand it as the mother of all sales when it actually was a clearance sale, now that is <em>chutzpah</em>,&rdquo; says a disgruntled consumer who tried to buy a TV during the sale. The real question, then, is whether it was just the Big Billion sale that was an act of <em>chutzpah</em>, or is that the way the Bansals are shaping up Flipkart?</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>The big bang&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">In the English language, <em>chutzpah</em> is often used to describe the audacity, brashness and supreme self-confidence that allows a person to take risks without the fear of failing, much like the way the Bansals function. How else do you explain the Big Billion Sale hoardings that were put up near the international airport and along the highway in Bengaluru as part of what the company called the &lsquo;Welcome Mr Bezos&rsquo; campaign on the eve of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos&rsquo; visit to India recently? The Bansals are well known for pushing the boundaries for employees as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">&ldquo;Flipkart is a very highly performance-driven organisation, where you always over-commit and over-deliver. Its ambitions were always large. There were no baby steps and no concept of establishing proof of concept; it was more like all or nothing. Inside Flipkart, the message was always better done than perfect. It was okay to try and fail instead of spending too much time deliberating,&rdquo; a former employee says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">To say that the Bansals are ambitious would be an understatement at best &mdash; everyone involved agrees that the high-achieving businessmen are definitely men in a hurry. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get too much time to prove yourself either. If the desired results are not delivered within six months, then you will be in a different role,&rdquo; the ex-employee says. You wouldn&rsquo;t really get fired but some of the employees couldn&rsquo;t handle the pace of change. From being a two-member start-up in 2007 with an initial capital of Rs 5 lakh to being the market leader that delivers 5 million shipments to 22 million registered users on a monthly basis, Flipkart sure has come a long way. The Bansals &mdash; school friends who are now in their early thirties and are known to finish each other&rsquo;s sentences &mdash; are also quite unlike each other. While Binny opens up more easily and is more extroverted, Sachin is more introverted &mdash; a stereotypical <em>bania</em> who just wants to do his <em>dhandha</em>. &ldquo;They are definitely a bunch of smart guys but what makes them stand out is their single-minded ambition to change how India shops. I remember telling my colleague back in 2009 after meeting the duo that these guys will make it big,&rdquo; says a venture capitalist who eventually lost out to Accel Partners in Flipkart&rsquo;s first round of funding, where the company raised $1 million.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>GRAPHIC:&nbsp;Flipkart corporate structure</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">With both the founders being techies at heart, Flipkart&rsquo;s DNA at the time when it was launched was that of a technology organisation. &ldquo;It was very clear that engineers were seen as the heart of the organisation. In fact, employees of all the support functions always used to complain about how the engineers always had well-stocked fridges while they had to make do with whatever was available,&rdquo; says the former employee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">As Flipkart scaled, a lot more people from the retail business joined the company, helping the Bansals get a better grip on that side of the business. Though the Bansals have clearly indicated of late that they look up to Jack Ma and Alibaba as their role model, it is clear that their previous employer &mdash; Amazon &mdash; did shape their thinking early on. In fact, in one of their interviews in 2011, they had gone on record to say that they wanted to become the Amazon of India. &ldquo;In their early days, it was clear that they idolised Jeff Bezos and were hoping to implement a lot of what they had done at Amazon, with a slight tweak to suit Indian conditions,&rdquo; says the former Flipkart employee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">In fact, when they began operations, the Bansals followed a hybrid model where they would hold their own inventory as well as source products from other vendors, much like Amazon did in the US. But in February 2013, Flipkart moved to the marketplace model, as FDI regulations did not allow investments in online multi-brand retail. A lot of features that the company has introduced since are along the lines of what Amazon has already done over the years. Take, for instance, its annual membership fee-based service called Flipkart First, built along the same lines as Amazon Prime. Offered services include free shipping for all orders, same-day delivery guarantee at a discounted price, a 60-day replacement policy and priority service from customer support. In July 2014, Flipkart also launched its own brand of tablet under the brand name Digiflip &mdash; much like Amazon&rsquo;s Kindle &mdash; and has gone on to add a whole host of electronic accessories as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Flipkart, which currently has about 14,000 employees on its rolls, is also looking to increase its headcount to 25,000 by the end of the year. Its engineering team alone will have 1,200 people on its rolls by the end of 2014. It is looking to increase the number of sellers on its platform, which, at 4,500, is much lower than the 10,000 sellers Amazon India and 50,000 merchants that Snapdeal have on their respective platforms. Flipkart is looking to increase that number by 12,000 by the end of 2014. Though the company moved to a marketplace model last year, nearly 70-80% of its goods are sold by its former subsidiary WS Retail.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">In March 2014, the company announced that it had hit a gross merchandise value (GMV), which is the value of goods sold, of $1 billion based on its February monthly sales. According to Flipkart, it is well on its way to achieve an annual run rate of $3 billion by the end of fiscal 2015 on the back of its exclusive tie-ups with mobile manufacturers such as Motorola, Xiaomi, Huawei and its increasing market share (55%) in the fashion category post its merger with Myntra. In an earlier media interview, Mukesh Bansal, the CEO of Myntra and now head of fashion at Flipkart, said fashion as a category currently clocks about $700 million and is on its way to becoming a billion-dollar business for the company. Flipkart acquired Myntra in May 2014 in a deal estimated to be around #2,000 crore. It helped that the companies had common investors, Flipkart had the access to funds that Myntra needed and Myntra could help Flipkart achieve its goal of being the market leader in this category. All these factors made for a very convenient marriage. One of the key reasons why Flipkart was looking to increase its presence in this segment is because apparel and footwear come with healthier margins of 30% compared with electronics such as laptops, mobiles and cameras, which enjoy a modest margin of 10% and make up nearly two-thirds of the market. The apparel segment, on the other hand, currently makes up 25-28% of the market. So, though e-tailing has been one of the fastest growing segments in India, with an average growth of nearly 60% over the last five years (2009-2013), it has primarily been a low-margin business that depends on large volumes to offset margin pressures. And making things worse are players competing among themselves to offer deep discounts to land many more customers.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Discounting game</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s a harsh reality &mdash; the Indian consumer is far more price-sensitive as compared with his global counterpart, which means that low prices continue to be the most important driver for online shopping in India. According to industry reports, it costs anywhere between Rs 1,000-1,500 to acquire customers online, and even this cannot guarantee customer loyalty. A report put out by VCCircle in October says that this year, Flipkart has reportedly spent Rs 650 crore on advertising across TV, print and online media in its bid to attract more consumers. Customers are only too happy to move from one site to another at even the slightest hint of a difference in price. Alok Kejriwal, CEO, Games2win believes that with a lot of me-too players vying for the same consumer in the e-commerce space, deep discounts are not going away anytime soon. &ldquo;Though Flipkart is the market leader, the deep discounts offered by the other players will limit its ability to raise prices,&rdquo; he says. Flipkart came under a lot of fire from offline retailers such as Future Group and online vendors for selling some products below cost. On its Big Billion sale day, Flipkart claimed to have sold over 20 lakh products to nearly 1.5 million shoppers, grossing $100 million in sales. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t build a sustainable business on discounts in the long term. In the end, you are only hurting your brand,&rdquo; says J Suresh, managing director, Arvind Lifestyle Brands.</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong><em>"Though Flipkart is the market leader, the deep discounts offered by other players will limit its ability to raise prices" -&nbsp;</em><em>Alok Kejriwal,&nbsp;</em></strong><em><strong>CEO, Games2win</strong>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p class="p3">During its recent Big Billion Day sales, the discounts were almost borne entirely by Flipkart where sellers were reimbursed for the shortfall. Amazon and Snapdeal also follow a similar practice. But despite the fast and furious scale in revenues, Flipkart is said to be losing an estimated $10 million each month due to the discounts being doled out to its customers. Their deep pocketed investors have funded many of these discounts. The stakes have only gotten higher with each round, leading to increasing concerns about whether this capital-fuelled growth is sustainable and, more importantly, if this is the most efficient way to build a business. For instance, after pumping in about $1 billion, Reliance Retail finally managed to garner revenues of Rs 14,496 crore and made cash profits for the first time only in FY14, nearly seven years after being in business. At the end of FY14, the company had 1,691 stores across 146 cities, spread over nearly 12 million sq ft. &ldquo;If, without a physical network of stores, Flipkart needs to pump in just as much money to generate revenues on the same level as an offline retailer, then where is the benefit of technology following through,&rdquo; asks a venture capitalist. With the company&rsquo;s latest financials not in the public domain, it is unclear just how much of its investment has gone in creating assets and how much has gone to fund its cash burn.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Paper value</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">In its latest round of funding, Flipkart raised a jaw-dropping $1 billion from its existing group of investors &mdash; Tiger Global, Naspers, Singapore&rsquo;s GIC and Accel Partners &mdash; who were also one of its earliest investors. It was the biggest amount raised by an Indian start-up, second only to Uber&rsquo;s $1.2 billion round of funding in June 2014. While Uber was valued at $18 billion, Flipkart&rsquo;s valuation is estimated to be around $5 billion-7 billion. Since its launch in 2007, the company has raised $1.78 billion in funding from various investors (<em>see: Billion dollar baby</em>). &ldquo;The Bansals are like the pied pipers of the e-commerce space. Every time they play their flutes, investors bring out their cheque books,&rdquo; says a venture cap investor requesting anonymity.</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>GRAPHIC: Billion dollar baby</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The company&rsquo;s rise to a multi-billion dollar valuation has been rapid, a little too quick for comfort, in fact, as some would say. For instance, when Flipkart raised $210 million from Russian billionaire Yuri Milner&rsquo;s fund DST in May 2014 &mdash; post its Myntra merger &mdash; the firm&rsquo;s valuation was pegged at $2.6 billion; in the space of less than two months, valuation had more than doubled. The company had raised $150 million in August 2012, at a time when it was valued at $1.04 billion. By 2013, it had raised $360 million, translating into a valuation of $1.6 billion. But investors are not too worried. &ldquo;Neither do we focus on what others are saying about valuation, nor do we think about valuations in the near term,&rdquo; says Sameer Gandhi, partner, Accel Partners US. &ldquo;Flipkart is an investment for the long term, because we think the company will be the market leader for the next generation of commerce in India, which is set to be one of the largest economies in the world,&rdquo; he says. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">The founders remain unperturbed about profitability.&nbsp; Sachin Bansal has said that the firm can be profitable if it chooses to but it was a strategic decision not to do so. And he has the investors'' vote. &ldquo;Our belief is that Flipkart is doing exactly what it should be: investing substantially in building the foundation for long-term success,&rdquo; says Accel&rsquo;s Gandhi. To back its $1 billion revenue run rate, Flipkart has raised around $541 million in six rounds of funding so far. The latest round of funding would be enough to help the company get to a run rate of $5-6 billion, which could get it a valuation of $25-30 billion. &ldquo;We will have to wait and see whether venture capitalists will continue to have the appetite to keep funding this cash war,&rdquo; says Kejriwal.</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>"Flipkart is doing exactly what it should be: investing substantially in building the foundation for long-term success" -&nbsp;Sameer Gandhi,&nbsp;Partner, Accel Partners US</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">So far, the cheques have been flying in thick and fast. &ldquo;Flipkart has primarily become an investor-driven company. If I were a hedge fund investor, my focus would be on the valuation and how to bump that up, not on profits. That&rsquo;s why there is so much buzz about valuation,&rdquo; says a VC investor who did not wish to be named.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">In the past, Accel Partners and Tiger Global have been beneficiaries of high-profile IPOs and dizzy valuations. As early investors in Facebook, they saw its valuation increase from $10 billion in 2010 to $104 billion in 2012 when it listed. &ldquo;Investors are a peculiar bunch of people. They are paranoid about missing a deal and the possibility of making an extraordinary return. In this case, the moment Tiger made the second round of funding, the others followed, with the logic being that maybe Tiger spotted something that they might have missed,&rdquo; says an investor who chose to stay out of the bidding war.</p>\n<p class="p2">But things could change overnight. &ldquo;It is important to know that capital is not always going to be cheaply available. Markets could turn on a dime and liquidity can vanish as easily as it was once available,&rdquo; says US-based angel investor and Junglee founder Venky Harinarayan, who helped Amazon build its marketplace model. &ldquo;It is important to build a business model that can sustain itself during tough times. That is possible only if your contribution margins are positive. You can scale back your investments in fixed assets but if you are selling at a loss at the unit level, then it would be hard to sustain the business,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>"It&rsquo;s important to know that capital is not always going to be cheaply available. liquidity can vanish as easily as it was once available" -&nbsp;Venky Harinarayan,&nbsp;Angel investor and founder, Junglee</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">For Flipkart, the next round is likely to be an IPO, because no strategic investor would be willing to pay that high a price for an entry into India. Amazon is cementing its position in the local market with much less and hopes its planned $2 billion investment will help it move ahead faster in this race with Flipkart.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>It&rsquo;s different</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">While a US market listing seems to be on the cards for Flipkart in a couple of years, investors would likely weigh any potential investment in Flipkart against Amazon and the recently listed Alibaba. And though Amazon has rarely stayed in the black in its 20-year history, it has more than made up for that with its track record of making great pay-offs on its investments &mdash; be it Amazon Prime, Kindle, video streaming and its cloud service AWS. Which is also why investors have been so patient with Amazon &mdash; they are fairly certain that when the company invests, its decision results in increased cashflows in future. One of Amazon&rsquo;s key strengths has been its ability to invest in growth without raising any money. Over 2001-2014, the company raised $623 million as debt while repurchasing shares of $1.28 billion, making its net external financing negative $685 million. Over the past 10 years, Amazon has generated free cash flows of $14.38 billion after all its investments. It has a market capitalisation of $133 billion and its revenue in 2013 was $74 billion and profit was $375 million.</p>\n<p class="p2">Chinese internet giant Alibaba, on the other hand,&nbsp;made its debut on the American stock market recently, raising&nbsp;$21.8 billion. The IPO, which was priced at $68 per share, valued the company at $168 billion. Post the 38% gain on listing, the firm&rsquo;s valuation was bumped up to $230 billion, greater than the total market cap of Amazon and eBay. Alibaba dominates online retail in China, accounting for nearly three-fourths of the market. In GMV, it is bigger than Amazon and eBay combined and, more importantly, is rolling in profits, unlike most e-commerce players. In 2013, its revenue was $7.5 billion, with profit at $3.56 billion. With only about half of China&rsquo;s 1.3 billion-strong population online, compared with 90% of the 300 million US citizens, a lot of investors are willing to bet on Alibaba. Part of the reason why the company dominates the e-commerce market in China is because it controls the entire value chain present in B2B and B2C markets, as well as the payment systems. Combined with regulatory support from its government, Alibaba has been unbeatable in the Chinese market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">While a lot of bets are being placed on the Indian market evolving like the Chinese market, the reality may not be as rosy. &ldquo;While the Indian market is expected to mirror the potential of the US and Chinese markets, the reality is quite different. In the US, you have customers who are willing to pay a premium for good products and in China, regulatory support makes it difficult for foreign players to make a dent in the domestic market, helping Chinese entrepreneurs build winner-takes-all kind of businesses. In India, it is difficult to do business and make money as increasing competition means that such price wars will continue,&rdquo; says Wazir&rsquo;s Sahni.</p>\n<p class="p2">In China, the marketplace model makes up 90% of the e-commerce market, whereas in the US, it makes up around 25%. In India, marketplace models are tough to execute due to several reasons &mdash; most vendors are not very comfortable with the digital platform and that, coupled with large gaps in the logistics infrastructure, has led to poor service levels. &ldquo;With the rapid growth of the marketplace, there have been complaints about inconsistencies in delivery, customer service and quality,&rdquo; says Pragya Singh, associate vice-president, retail, Technopak. According to Technopak, the percentage of cancellations in India across players is 10-15%, compared with mature markets in the West, which have cancellation rates of 2-4%. While some of these are thanks to customer cancellations, a large chunk is also from the vendors&rsquo; side, thanks to non-availability of products due to poor inventory management and inadequate IT infrastructure. Now, leading players such as Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal are trying to mitigate that by adopting a managed marketplace model by which they control the last-mile delivery, thereby ensuring a better customer experience but it increases overall costs.</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>"Rapid growth of the marketplace has resulted in complaints about inconsistencies in delivery, customer service and quality" -&nbsp;Pragya Singh,&nbsp;Associate vice-president, retail, Technopak</strong></p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Boom or bust?</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">Organised players have an 8% share of the overall retail market in India and their share is projected to reach 14% by the end of 2020. At $3 billion, online retailing forms a mere 0.4% of this market and is projected to reach $32 billion, or 3%, of the total retail market by 2020. A key reason for this is that online retail penetration in India is just one-fourth of the total 245 million internet users in India. The total number of net users is set to rise to 550 million by 2020, so even if penetration does not rise proportionately, the sheer number of people logging on to the internet will drive growth for e-commerce players. India has been one of the fastest growing markets for Amazon ever since it went live in June 2013. &ldquo;We have never seen this kind of growth in any of the markets we have been in and Amazon India has reached the billion-dollar mark in record time,&rdquo; says Amit Agarwal, VP and country manager, Amazon India. In a bid to win the e-commerce war, Amazon has announced that it will invest $2 billion over time to expand its presence in India. &ldquo;We wanted to make this kind of investment to reiterate to our vendors and customers that our flywheel is working fast. We continue to see a lot of potential in the Indian market.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>GRAPHIC:&nbsp;Internet users growth in India</strong></p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>"We haven&rsquo;t seen this kind of growth in other markets. amazon India has reached the billion-dollar mark in record time" -&nbsp;Amit Agarwal,&nbsp;Vice-president and country manager, Amazon India</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">In most of the markets it operates in, Amazon runs both inventory and marketplace models because the inventory model allows it to take advantage of economies of scale. But in India, it only operates as a marketplace, as FDI regulations do not allow foreign firms to start wholly-owned subsidiaries to sell directly to consumers. It has two fulfilment centres, in Mumbai and Bengaluru, and is adding five more to improve its distribution network. Amazon manages the entire warehousing, logistics, packaging and customer service for vendors through its Amazon Fulfilled Service, and delivers the goods from the vendors to the buyers through Easy Ship. Flipkart and Snapdeal also offer similar services to their vendors; Snapdeal has 40 fulfilment centres across the country, while Flipkart has six warehouses and has engineers working on improving the last-mile delivery between the warehouse and the customer. While technology-led innovations will improve the customer experience, e-commerce remains a capital-fuelled game and the one with the deepest pockets will be the last company standing. &ldquo;There are no deep pockets in any business, only happy investors who indulge you. Once the smiles vanish, the deep pockets will vanish as well,&rdquo; says Kejriwal. While the next couple of years will go without too many funding worries for Flipkart with the backing of its investors including a sovereign fund, they will have to sustain this growth momentum to justify their gravity-defying valuation and execution on a large scale can become challenging as was seen on the Big Billion Day sale.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">While e-commerce is the next step in the evolution of retail, it remains to be seen how efficiently online players can build their business. When organised retail made its debut in India, there was a big hue and cry about how it would displace the unorganised players. Several years down the line, unorganised players still make up more than 90% of the market. The reason why organised players didn&rsquo;t make as big a dent in the market as expected was because most of them were not running efficient businesses. Similarly, while there is a definite value proposition that comes with the e-commerce business &mdash; convenience, a wide range of products &mdash; these businesses are unable to charge for this value addition thanks to intense price wars. Companies like Flipkart are working on borrowed time and have to prove themselves in a hurry if they want to keep raking in investor moolah. After all, throwing good money after bad is not a sustainable strategy in the long term. <span class="s1">&beta;</span></p>', 'Flipkart’s furious pace of growth has been wheeled by aggressive discounts resulting in a fair bit of red ink.

(170, 12, '', 'Bridging the gap', '<p class="p1">T ake two dyed-in-the-wool Delhi boys, shift them to Chennai &mdash; where the &ldquo;weather is cruel, cultural differences are stark, and the language unfamiliar&rdquo; &mdash; and they will either pack their bags and head back home, or they will hunker down and turn to their work. Umesh Sachdev and Ravi Saraogi clearly belong to the latter category. Seven years after they moved to the city to be part of the IIT Madras incubator, Chennai is now &ldquo;home&rdquo; and headquarters of their six-year-old, Rs 9-crore business: Uniphore Software Systems, which is trying to bridge the information and digital divide in rural India through its speech-based mobile solutions. Not bad at all for two people who started their entrepreneurial journey early, but not too successfully.</p>\n<p class="p3">Sachdev and Saraogi were still studying information technology in Delhi in 2006 when they set up their first venture, Singularis Technologies, to track lost mobiles. The business didn&rsquo;t take off, but it did set the stage for their next venture. While building business for Singularis, the duo met several influencers in the telecom field, from service providers and regulators to telecom experts, including Ashok Jhunjhunwala, professor of electrical engineering at IIT Chennai, who invited Sachdev and Saraogi to become a part of the Rural Technology and Business incubator (RTBI) at IIT, which he was running. &ldquo;He told us, &lsquo;I can see you are very passionate about technology and mobility but lack business acumen. We can fill the gaps with mentorship through our extensive alumni network&rsquo;,&rdquo; recalls Umesh Sachdev, the 28-year-old CEO of Uniphore.</p>\n<p class="p3">The opportunity to build what could possibly be the next big thing in telecom was too good to miss. As soon as they graduated in 2007, Saraogi and Sachdev shifted to Chennai and began laying the foundation for their undecided new venture. This time, the duo decided to figure out the gaps in the market and build a business model around it rather than building a product and then finding the market fit. They were certain they wanted to leverage the mobile medium to provide access to key services such as commerce, livelihood-relation information and entertainment. In telecom, though, it was clear that 95% Indian mobile subscribers were only using voice and any solution they built would have to be based on voice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">As part of a test pilot, they set up a call centre that provided information on subjects such as agriculture, health, education, employment and entertainment. They put up posters in three districts in Tamil Nadu, with a number of the call centre, asking people to call in for information. The result was better than expected: they got more than 10,000 calls in three months. The maximum questions related to agriculture, employment and financial services and the call centre was able to answer 90% of them after searching the internet.</p>\n<p class="p3">Clearly, the information and the information-seeker both existed; only the divide had to be bridged. And the process would have to be automated, since a one-to-one call centre wouldn''t be cost effective. &ldquo;We knew we had to automate the process and have the computer answer the questions,&rdquo; says Saraogi, the 30-year-old COO of Uniphore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">More importantly, the response to queries would have to be in the local language of the caller. So, Sachdev and Saraogi built a mobile platform based on speech recognition algorithms that could convert text to speech and back in Indian languages. The platform would deliver customised information on a variety of subjects, which customers could access through the speech recognition system. Working on the insight that for financial services, voice authentication was critical for the transaction, they also developed a voice biometric system that authenticates the customer&rsquo;s voice before transaction. The company has applied for four patents on the technology it developed for speech recognition and voice biometrics. With the technology in place, Uniphore was finally launched in April 2008.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>At your service</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">So, what does Uniphore do? It uses voice and data technology to transform any mobile device into an enterprise delivery platform connecting businesses in sectors such as agriculture, financial services, retail, education and their customers. The firm has developed two cloud-based products that can be downloaded as apps onto phones. In partnership with the US-based Nuance Communications, a $1.8-billion speech recognition firm, Uniphore developed VoiceNet, which works on interactive voice response (IVR) and has been especially developed for low-end phones. Target customers: financial services firms and banks that want to enable rural consumers to carry out transactions remotely. Consumers dial the bank, which greets them through the IVR and authenticates their voice by asking them to repeat a phrase. Once the voice sample is matched with the records, they are allowed to transact. VoiceNet is also being used by contract framing companies and agricultural input business to deliver customised information on the weather, products and farming techniques to farmers, patients who cannot visit hospitals, even train students and teachers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Uniphore&rsquo;s other flagship product, mForce, developed for smartphones and tablets, helps financial services firms improve the efficiency of their field sales force and retail firms deliver real-time information across their distribution chain in small towns and villages by making the entire documentation process seamless. Now, the process of filling forms, scanning documents and getting approvals, which takes a week to 10 days, can be done instantly through the agent&rsquo;s smartphone or tablet.</p>\n<p class="p3">Given the growing focus on financial inclusion and rural customers, it&rsquo;s not surprising that there are several takers for its products, including the Tamil Nadu government, Thomson Reuters, financial services firms such as Cholamandalam and Muthoot Finance, and banks such as Axis Bank and State Bank of India. Different customers use different services and are charged on a per transaction basis. The cost to the customer varies from 50-60 paise to Rs 5-6 per transaction, depending on the volumes &mdash; whether it is, say, a bank, reaching out to its depositors, or a company carrying out a pilot project in just one or two towns.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Uniphore now has 76 employees, including a sales and marketing team of 20, and around 40 customers who together reach out to over 2 million end-users.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Powering the change</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The founders invested Rs 5 lakh of their own money in their venture, which formed part of the $100,000 seed funding they had raised from RTBI, the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) and non-profit organisation, Villgro, which invests in firms that transform lives in rural India. &ldquo;Uniphore will help bridge the digital divide between rural and urban India with their technology,&rdquo; says PR Ganapathy, COO, Villgro. &ldquo;We are excited that the firm is using cutting edge tech to benefit the people at the bottom of the pyramid by delivering information and extending banking services to them.&rdquo; Plans are on to raise series A funding to help the firm achieve its ambition of increasing revenue from the current Rs 9 crore to Rs 120 crore by FY18. &ldquo;We are crossing the chasm where people wanted to try our product because they were excited about new tech to where customers are realising the business sense of what we are offering,&rdquo; says Sachdev.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"We are excited that the firm is using tech to benefit the people at the bottm of the pyramid" - PR Ganapathy, COO, Villgro</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">And that&rsquo;s not just in India. Saraogi says Uniphore has been getting offers to launch its services in Iran and Africa. For now, it wants to stay focused on the opportunity in India. &ldquo;A couple of years from now, we will pick geographies where we can replicate what we have done in India,&rdquo;&nbsp; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">The duo sees speech recognition tech taking off in the next couple of years as larger firms such as Google and Apple continue to place bets around the technology. &ldquo;We want to be ahead of the technology, so we are investing back in our processes,&rdquo; says Saraogi. Challenges remain: from finding the people to work on high-end tech to driving adoption of the technology in traditional industries. Says Villgro&rsquo;s Ganapathy, &ldquo;Companies are now increasingly using the technology to increase their reach with consumers and its growth potential is immense given the pain points it solves for firms and consumers alike.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"A couple of years from now, we will pick up geographies where we can replicate what we have done in India" - Ravi Saraogi, COO, Uniphore</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">And while tech firms from Infosys and Wipro to standalone app developers can offer mobile apps and firms such as VoiceTrust can offer speech recognition tech as individual offerings, no one else offers both as an integrated platform and focused on enterprise mobility. Uniphore&rsquo;s first-mover advantage aside, the company&rsquo;s edge also comes from its multi-language portfolio, which recognises over 100 local dialects in addition to 14 Indian languages and some foreign languages such as Arabic and Tagalog. Besides, Uniphore is also talking with OEM handset and tablet manufacturers to embed the application in their devices, which will help the company widen its footprint much faster and give it a distinct edge over rivals. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">And that&rsquo;s a priority, since Uniphore doesn&rsquo;t see itself as a social enterprise, even though its opportunity lies in rural markets. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think entrepreneurship has a suffix or prefix. We chose to operate in the rural market because it was an untapped market. It was a business decision,&rdquo; says Sachdev. According to him, the focus has always been to run a profitable business, which helped the company break even in the second year of operations, with the primary goal of delivering value to consumers. Social or not, it is clear that Uniphore will transform rural lives using mobility. With its technology and a population of 850 million mobile users, it is only a matter of time before it does.&nbsp;</p>', 'Uniphore''s speech recognition and voice biometrics technology has banks and rural-focused companies queueing up ', '6', '', 0, '', 'bridging-the-gap-170', 165, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Bridging the gap', 'Uniphore''s speech recognition and voice biometrics technology has banks and rural-focused companies queueing up ', '', '', '', 'Uniphore Software Systems,Speech recognition,Voice biometrics,VoiceNet,mForce', 0, NULL, '2015-01-20 18:34:20', '2015-01-21 11:24:07', '2014-03-15', 0),
(171, 12, '', 'Hype, hope, expectation', '<p class="p1">What a difference a year makes. In fact, this time around last year, amid chest-beating about policy paralysis and an alarming current account deficit, the rupee was rebounding from its all-time low of about 70 against the dollar and the market was pinning its hopes on the new Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan to work his magic. Like most things Indian, there was a twist. Rajan was the icing; the cake came later in the form of the decisive election victory of the BJP led-National Democratic Alliance.</p>\n<p class="p2">With the hype around the historical mandate yet to die down, the hope now is that the Sensex will go even higher as the BJP government does what is expected of it. To gauge how much of it will come through, we have made our way to The Pierre Hotel in New York, which sits across the city&rsquo;s evergreen landmark, Central Park. The 85-year-old Pierre has a colourful history and among many things, has witnessed the Great Depression, an infamous heist, the filming of a classic tango and multiple changes in ownership. Once owned by billionaire tycoon Jean Paul Getty, whose formula for success, much like fellow mega-billionaire John Davison Rockefeller, was, &ldquo;Rise early, work hard, strike oil&rdquo;, the Pierre was acquired by the Indian Hotels Company in 2005, a year when nothing could go wrong, not just in India but across the world. The late 2008 credit crisis, for many, was still undreamt fiction. Since then fiction did play out in its strangest form and many QEs later, investors still fondly recall the go-go years that lasted from 2003 to 2008.</p>\n<p class="p2">Cut to the present. About 9,000 sq ft of unadulterated opulence awaited investors who had gathered at the Grand Ballroom for the&nbsp;10<sup>th</sup> annual India Investment Forum organised by international finance publisher <em>Institutional Investor</em>. Given such an extremely over-auspicious build-up, the forum, in its 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;edition, was expected to be the most well-attended yet, but attendance thinned once it became known that finance minister Arun Jaitley would be skipping the event owing to health reasons. Surface transport minister Nitin Gadkari also failed to surface as campaigning for the Maharashtra assembly elections had gathered momentum; maybe he had an inkling of the impending break-up of the 25-year old BJP-Shiv Sena alliance in the state. Coal minister Piyush Goyal&rsquo;s absence was attributed to the upcoming Supreme Court judgement on coal block allocations. As it turned out, the next day, the apex court cancelled almost all the licences allocated since 1993.</p>\n<p class="p2">The ministers and bureaucrats playing hookey did act as a dampener. For the organisers, it must have felt like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. The same had happened during the last India Investment Forum in September 2012, when many UPA-II ministers pulled out at the last moment fearing a government collapse (the conference was not held last year, given the dismal sentiment).</p>\n<p class="p2">Naturally, as the attendees gathered in the Garden Foyer, the early morning conversation centered on the need for more forthright communication on part of Indian ministers and bureaucrats, who take many things for granted. This informal chat about lack of protocol led to a fixed income investor recounting the temerity of a former RBI deputy governor, who arrived late for a meeting with a group of foreign investors. After he was seated, without apology, he boasted, &ldquo;You know what is so great about India&hellip;we have the highest number of PhDs.&rdquo; One of the investors, clearly incensed by the delay, interjected, &ldquo;Then why are your stats so bad?&rdquo; Amid all-round guffawing, Oliver Fratzsche, who was among the panelists at this year&rsquo;s forum and whose company advises institutions investing in emerging markets, mentioned how there was not much difference between the recommendations made by the IMF in 1991 and 2014 with respect to improving India&rsquo;s fisc.</p>\n<p class="p2">The more things change in India, the more they stay the same was a much-repeated refrain. Veteran India hand and Omega Capital chairman Raju Panjwani did not pull any punches either. &ldquo;You need 16 licences for the simplest business that you want to set up in India. Why would somebody in America, who can set up a company online in 20 minutes for $200, even think about India? In the few India conferences that have happened here recently, there hasn&rsquo;t been much attendance despite the change in government. There isn&rsquo;t any perceptible change in mood. It is more like, &lsquo;Here comes India again. Let them demonstrate change before I come in and listen to all these lectures again&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong><em>"There isn&rsquo;t any perceptible change in mood. It is more like, &lsquo;Let them [india] demonstrate change before I come in&rdquo; -&nbsp;</em><span class="s1"><em>Raju Panjwani, </em></span>chairman, Omega Capital</strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Capital account</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">India may not be the cynosure of all eyes yet but there is renewed interest as the policy and macro picture has improved dramatically over the past few months.(<em>See: Double jackpot</em>) The new prime minister is single-handedly responsible for this positive change in sentiment. Depending on how you look at it, this could either be a reason to celebrate or for concern. The force of his personality, which is reason for cheer, is also a cause of worry for a great many investors. In fact, one of the investors attending the forum did pose this question to Jayant Sinha, the ruling party&rsquo;s member of parliament from Hazaribagh, who spoke on behalf of his party at the forum <strong>(SEE: LINK TO JAYANT SINHA STORY)</strong>. Sinha, a Harvard Business School alumnus who got elected from his father&rsquo;s &mdash; senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha &mdash; constituency, contested the investor&rsquo;s fear that the BJP does not have a B-team beyond prime minister Modi.</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>GRAPHIC: Double jackpot</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Partly agreeing that there was, indeed, a keyman risk, Sinha went on to say, &ldquo;Mr Modi is a phenomenal leader and if something were to happen to him, we would all be worried. As for the B-team: the BJP is a meritocratic organisation with tremendous bench strength; we have a number of fairly eminent leaders and a terrific group of people coming up who are currently in their 40s and 50s. BJP, unlike other political parties in India, is capable of institutional rejuvenation and generational change.&rdquo; As there was no follow-up query, it could either be that the audience might have found the answer satisfying or didn&rsquo;t want to be delayed for lunch at the Pierre&rsquo;s Cotillion Room. Despite hurrying along as fast as they could, they didn&rsquo;t find Al Pacino doing the tango there like he did in the 1992 classic <em>Scent of a Woman</em>.</p>\n<p class="p2">While the three-course lunch at the&nbsp;Cotillion&nbsp;did turn out to be appetising, investors still find the bureaucratic red tape in India hard to digest. And there are quite a few horror stories, says the New York-based Panjwani, some that he himself continues to endure. He pauses briefly as if to contain his anger at what he is being made to go through at his Indian software exports company. &ldquo;We have been filing returns for the past seven years but have not got back the first assessment year&rsquo;s TDS (tax deducted at source) because the officer is saying today&rsquo;s rate is 25%. A 25% kickback for what? It is my own money and you have sat on it for six years. When the guys in the US hear war stories like this, nobody wants to invest,&rdquo; he fumes.</p>\n<p class="p2">Along with Panjwani&rsquo;s grouse about ridiculously excessive paperwork in both FDI and portfolio investments, Pashupati Advani attributes the geographic divide to be another contributing factor for the disinterest of US investors who have stayed away from Indian equities. &ldquo;As a debt player, I am happy to get a 5-7% dollar-denominated return but as an equity investor, I may be doing better here, as the US market has done well over the past couple of years. Here, the process is easier; you just press a button and it is done. In India, you have to dance and get this paper and that paper done,&rdquo; says Advani, whose firm Global Foray advises institutional investors wanting to invest in India. &ldquo;From the US, India seems very far. My experience is that in the US, the emerging market money tends to stay in this time zone, so it stays in South America rather than coming to the east. And a lot of money that comes to the east is driven by guys sitting in Hong Kong and Singapore, who work for US firms,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Fixing terra firma</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">The line between regulation and excessive control in India is a blur and it is control that enables you to seek rents. They may not know a <em>paratha</em> from a <em>chapati</em> or be able to differentiate between Hunan and Sichuan sauce, but for most foreign investors in India and China, <em>baksheesh</em> and <em>hu&igrave;l&ugrave;</em> are familiar terms. Hence, while the macro picture does look good for now, there is a need for tweaking at the micro level; grassroots corruption is something that the prime minister will have to fix.&nbsp; &ldquo;At the lower level, people do not have any taxing or spending authority. Their way of gaining power is to apply a personal tax on every transaction. The solution is to get incentives right at the bottom in a way that leads to economic growth. That is a much bigger transformation that needs to happen in India. Right now, the states are very powerful and the cities are incredibly weak,&rdquo; says William Antholis, managing director, The Brookings Institution.</p>\n<p class="p2">Besides pushing through a mindset change at the ground level, the other major challenge for Modi is getting non-BJP states to realign with his vision of making India an economic power. Reform is going to be very difficult and it is very important that national reforms mirror at the state level. Antholis points out,&nbsp;&ldquo;In India, power and water are handled at the state level. For now, the prime minister does not have a mandate in the upper house; his party controls only five states and is at loggerheads with the state governments in the south and the east. He is going to face this tension as he goes about trying to transplant the Gujarat <em>miracle</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Not much legroom</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">Tax harassment is a hassle not only for investors like Panjwani but even for multinationals such as Vodafone. The telecom major might have recently got a favourable Bombay high court ruling in its FY10 transfer pricing dispute against the income tax department but, given the demand involved (Rs 3,200 crore), it is unlikely that the department will not appeal the ruling in the Supreme Court. Incidentally, Vodafone has been a favourite whipping boy and the government is in multiple disputes with it as a result of its retrospective amendments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Tax terrorism is a natural outcome when the state is fiscally challenged and the witticism that went round after retrograde retrospective amendments started taking place regularly was: &ldquo;The future was always uncertain but now, in India, even the past has become uncertain.&rdquo; Investors are edgy about the fact that there has been no clear commitment on withdrawal of retrospective or extra territorial amendments. They, however, continue to take solace in the fact that the finance minister himself is a lawyer and would possibly be sympathetic in the FY16 budget. That may seem rational but there is not much latitude on the fiscal deficit front as for FY15, government borrowing has already reached 75% of the Budget estimate. The market might well be discounting a fiscal deficit of 4.5% instead of 4.1% for FY15 but is equally eager to see a realistic revision of the FY16 target of 3.6%.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>GRAPHIC: Breaking out</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">While the finance minister has started inviting suggestions and estimates for the FY16 Budget from various ministries, it is the final draft which the market is keenly waiting for. If the right commitments are made, the honeymoon period being enjoyed by the BJP government could well be extended for another year at least, assuming stability in the global market. But global stability is not a given, cautions Sarvjeev Sidhu, head, emerging markets, Aegon USA Investment Management.&nbsp;&ldquo;A combination of rising rates in the US (as happened in the 1990s) and rising leverage in the corporate sector (1997 in Asia) could derail emerging markets. There has been explosive issuance of corporate debt in emerging markets in recent years. As US interest rates start rising that could cause refinancing challenges for the corporate sector, and a possible repeat of what happened in Asia in 1997,&rdquo; says Sidhu.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">The fall in the price of gold and crude reflects the fear of a rising interest rate in the US and an unwinding of carry trades. Brent crude is trading at its lowest over the past four years and that is making India&rsquo;s current and fiscal account deficit look extraordinarily good. It may portend low global growth but, for now, investors are more focused on the improving macro. The argument goes thus: even if we lose out on exports to Europe or China, the net balance of payments still works in India&rsquo;s favour. What is possibly getting ignored is the sentiment aspect or the fact that crude producers could taper their supply as the current price of $90 is not enough to support their expenditure budgets.</p>\n<p class="p2">Teresa Barger, managing director, Cartica Capital, which has 20% of its $2.8 billion portfolio in India, feels that policymakers should feel lucky about what is happening and take advantage of it. &ldquo;The geopolitical situation is on fire; what happens if Russian supply comes off? It is possibly a delayed reaction, as there was during the 1973 war between Egypt and Israel, when the price shock didn&rsquo;t come in till months later. I think oil under $100 a barrel is not something that we can count on.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">The currency, too, has been relatively stable but, lately, the RBI has been experiencing strain on account of the dollar&rsquo;s overall appreciation. In FY14, its net buying totaled nearly $9 billion. Even in FY15 thus far, its net purchase has been just over $15 billion. It is only in August this year that it has turned a net seller and, given that the dollar has been gathering steam for the past couple of months and FII flows have been slowing, the September data, too, might show that the central bank was a net dollar seller.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>GRAPHIC:&nbsp;Hitting where it hurts</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Though the RBI wants movement in the rupee to be orderly, during uncertainty, the currency market trades in anything but an orderly manner. Foreign investors are extremely sensitive to rupee depreciation, as it hits their absolute return <em>(See: Broader ain&rsquo;t much better)</em>. Advani thinks the volatility in the rupee holds the key to foreign institutional investors continuing to stay invested in the local market. &ldquo;The question everyone is asking is where is the rupee going and what could happen that could make it fall off? Compared with the 8% that you get on an Indian bond, you get 2% in the US. If the rupee is stable, investors effectively make 6% in dollar terms. That is a critical component but so far we have lost that battle.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>GRAPHIC:&nbsp;Broader ain&rsquo;t much better</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Foreign investors feeling homesick in a climate where business confidence in the world&rsquo;s major economies is declining is another worry. China&rsquo;s central bankers, like the European Central Bank (ECB), are grappling with falling demand and high debt. &ldquo;Over the past three years, fixed asset investment was fuelled by direct fiscal transfers and state-owned banks lending to state-owned enterprises. Right now, the estimates of non-recoverable debt in inland China are about $3 trillion. Nobody really knows what the nature of debt is in China or if it is $3 trillion or closer to $7 trillion? If you take into account all the debt that the Chinese are taking in other places, then the number becomes even more risky,&rdquo; says Antholis.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Nobody really knows what the nature of debt is in China or if it is $3 trillion or closer to $7 trillion?" -&nbsp;<span class="s1">William Antholis, </span>managing director, The Brookings Institution</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">On his part, ECB governor Mario Draghi is desperately trying to fend off deflation but whether he succeeds remains to be seen as he is only in charge of monetary, and not fiscal, policy for the region. Not that this situation has not played out before; we did have a Eurozone scare in 2010 and 2011 but that can was kicked down the road, and what happened in Cyprus in March 2013 stayed in Cyprus. Now, we are back to fretting about a slowdown in Europe and nowhere is the worry reflected more than in Germany, where the benchmark DAX has hit a one-year low. Even the Dow Jones Industrial Average has given up its gains for 2014 and the Fed, too, is coming up short in its attempt to shore up inflation. Oversupply in gas supplies is not helping either. Sticker prices at US gas stations are dropping and nothing succeeds in igniting inflation as higher fuel prices do. Clearly, historically low interest rates have not stoked inflation and a rising dollar is not helping. The Fed&rsquo;s only recourse in such a situation is verbal intervention, which it did through its latest Federal Open Market Committee statement. The other option is status quo on rates, which only fuels emerging markets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Russia is doing badly and so are Brazil and China, and that has gone in India&rsquo;s favour (<em>See: Hot, Hotter, Hottest</em>). As jitters intensify, it is hard to see why all emerging markets will not see an outflow, as investors barter higher returns for liquidity. In times of crisis, illiquidity is a clear and present danger in emerging markets and despite India being a trillion-dollar economy, its stock market is treacherously shallow. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get out in size and that has actually prevented the size investors from coming in.&nbsp;After 60-70 stocks, you can&rsquo;t get out as there is no liquidity. Even for companies such as Hindalco, which is in the Nifty, you would have difficulty selling $20-30 million worth of stock in a single day. You would have to spread the trade over two to three days. In the US, you might make a little less money, but the impact cost is not 5%,&rdquo; reminds Advani.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>GRAPHIC: Hot, Hotter, Hottest</strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Heavy Lifting</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">At this point, it may seem like we are in a sweet spot but there is a big difference this time. Global growth was great between 2003 and 2008 but that is not the case anymore. Also, during the 2003-2008 period, a virtuous cycle of lower interest rates, higher investment and savings, higher GDP growth, robust tax collection, lower fiscal deficit leading to lower interest rates was in play.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">This time, reviving animal spirits may not be as easy, though, as shown by the August IIP number which grew a measly 0.4%. More worrying is the fall in capital goods production. It only means that existing capacity is still not being fully utilised and companies are not feeling confident enough to add new capacity. Another red flag is that credit growth, too, has not shown any sign of picking up. The dismal August IIP number is more worrying because it is well after the new government was sworn in late May. If IIP growth continues to be weak, simmering tension between the government and the RBI regarding lower interest rates may again come to the fore. The RBI has been steadfast about bring CPI down to 6% (currently at 8%) by the end of 2015. Almost everybody, right from unscrupulous real estate developers to the occupants of North Block believe that lower interest rates will get demand moving. Even suggesting any kind of demand satiation or overcapacity is blasphemy that flies in the face of the great Indian growth story. It is hard to reconcile or even think that a 4% to 6% GDP growth is the new normal for the kind of setup that we now have in terms of infrastructure and salary levels in the country.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Panjwani recalls the difficulty of operating in a market like India. &ldquo;I myself set up Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s asset management and investment banking business in India and it took them 12 or 14 years before they saw any break-even point. I was told that we should be in India for the long run. Now, is long term three or five or 20 years? When the long run is not clear, that is when it starts to get murky.&rdquo; Consumer product companies will continue to invest because they will otherwise miss out on a big market. Even with them, there is frustration about the price point because you are there in the hope that pricing will change someday, he adds.</p>\n<p class="p2">Advani has been in the market for 25 years now but strains really hard when asked which legacy foreign institutional investors have consistently made money in the Indian market. &ldquo;Success stories in India have been companies such as Morgan Stanley, Oppenheimer and Fidelity, who have held on doggedly despite five-10 years of losses. Again, compared with the 20 years that they have been here, they have not made a really spectacular return. So, when someone asks me to give examples of five happy FIIs, I can&rsquo;t name any because they just don&rsquo;t exist. Of the $200 billion held by FIIs, I would say there is probably about not more than $20-30 billion in profit that is unrealised. The 5% of the emerging markets allocation that is going to remain in India has most of the gain.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>"When someone asks me to give examples of five happy FIIs, I can&rsquo;t name any because they just don&rsquo;t exist" -&nbsp;<span class="s1">Pashupati Advani, </span>founder, Global Foray</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Clearly, any exponential jump from here would need a favorable global tailwind. Sidhu notes, &ldquo;India is currently growing below potential by 1.5%. Lower energy prices and structural reforms should increase India&rsquo;s GDP growth. The question is, is it sustainable especially since global liquidity conditions are likely to tighten? Apart from uncertainty and turmoil, capital will likely flee due to concerns about emerging markets growth and high valuation. India&rsquo;s P/E is approximately 19, that is expensive. If India becomes relatively more expensive, foreign portfolio investors will take money out.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p2">Even if the status quo of ebullient sentiment and liquidity continues, the contradiction at this juncture is the inability of the country to absorb capital without resulting in a valuation bubble (private equity chasing e-commerce firms in search of an Indian Alibaba) or uncontrolled currency appreciation. The ability to absorb capital in many sectors is limited and sectors like banking, infrastructure, real estate which need capital are tightly regulated and have delivered lousy return. Overnight, the government may have changed but individual companies&rsquo; balance sheets have not.&nbsp;Then, there is the age-old issue of governance. For Barger, &ldquo;All promoters in India are guilty until proven innocent. We want to be sure that the promoter will not steal from minority shareholders.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p2">After India&rsquo;s about turn in July at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Barger is also worried about an autarkic mindset. &ldquo;Importing things into India is necessary to create a manufacturing industry. You import unfinished goods, work on them and re-export them, and that is where the WTO is quite helpful. The Chinese weren&rsquo;t caught up in autarky; they made 700 million people go from poverty to reasonable living. India&rsquo;s got 700 million left to go and you are not gonna do that by defying the physics of economics. And the most important function of economics is about making people less poor,&rdquo; she castigates.</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>"India has to lift 700 million out of poverty but you are not gonna do that by defying the physics of economics" -&nbsp;<span class="s1">Teresa Barger, </span>managing director, Cartica Capital</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Antholis contends that there is also a skill deficit that needs to be fixed. He explains, &ldquo;The biggest difference in India and China with respect to being ready for manufacturing is that since the 1940s, China decided to invest in primary and secondary higher education. The population was technically proficient but intellectually starved. India was the exact opposite. Nehru&rsquo;s vision was to have Oxford-style universities all across India, so you had investment in IITs and IIMs but under-investment in primary education. The exception was south India, which now has 80% to 90% literacy, as opposed to north India which has 60% to 70%.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Evidently, it is not just about vocalising shibboleths like Make in India; it is also about being ready at the ground level to facilitate such a transformation. The market is now awaiting implementation specifics on Make in India, Clean India and direct cash transfers through Aadhar. Already there is some disquiet about delay in PSU bank restructuring and privatisation and there being no implementation time-frame despite the Nayak committee report.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">&ldquo;Structural reforms under the leadership of Narendra Modi are expected to&nbsp;raise India&rsquo;s growth rate and attract foreign investments, especially when China appears to be&nbsp;slowing down. The government also needs to create an environment to attract NRI capital, similar to what China has done successfully in the past,&rdquo;&nbsp;remarks Sidhu. Subject to the right things being done, there is more money waiting to be deployed than India has the capacity to absorb. Potential big-moneyed overseas investors don&rsquo;t want to see the prime minister sweeping, they want sweeping reforms, and this time around they are shooting for the moon but expect to land on Mars. <span class="s1">&beta;</span></p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>"The government needs to create an environment to attract NRI capital, similar to what China has done" -&nbsp;<span class="s1">Sarvjeev Sidhu, </span>director EM, Aegon USA Investment Management</strong></p>', 'Given the new prime minister’s track record in Gujarat, investors are looking forward to a business-friendly regime.

(172, 16, '', 'Can and able', '<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In</span> a country of a billion people, a vast majority of them youngsters, how hard can it be to find &mdash; and retain &mdash; qualified workers for modern retail outlets? Quite hard, as chains are increasingly finding out. Thanks to skyrocketing attrition figures, retailers are looking to ensure that resources spent in training employees translate into higher productivity and retention, instead of workers abandoning the brand for better opportunities in no time. And they are receiving help from an unexpected quarter &mdash; the persons with disability (PwD) talent pool. From retail chains such as Hypercity, Lifestyle, Croma, Shoppers Stop, Reliance and Tanishq, to quick-service restaurants (QSRs) such as KFC, Domino&rsquo;s and Caf&eacute; Coffee Day, big brands have taken an inclusive turn when it comes to HR and, studies show, the returns have been well worth the change.</p>\n<p class="p3">A recently released white paper by Accenture India, which surveyed 15 retail chains employing PwDs, observes that 70% of respondents in the $500-billion Indian retail sector said hiring PwDs reduced attrition rates by about half (3.3% attrition for PwDs compared with the industry standard of 6.8%). Apart from serving as an inspiration for other employees, PwDs also helped generate positive word of mouth for the organisation. Sixty per cent of the respondents noted that PwDs were more productive than other employees. Says Vineet Ahuja, principal, management consulting, Accenture India, &ldquo;Apart from helping PwDs socially and financially, these hires help save money for retailers, as the government funds their EPS and ESI for the first three years.&rdquo; For the company, this translates to about 8% savings on a monthly salary of Rs 10,000 for every PwD employee. And with India having the world&rsquo;s largest population of PwDs &mdash; 70 million &mdash; there is a growing pool for retailers to choose from.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Helping hand</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">For companies, a common worry while employing PwDs in customer-facing roles is people&rsquo;s attitude towards disability. For instance, will some customers be impatient while interacting with hearing impaired employees? In such a case, would the company be willing to risk alienating these customers? But, with the rise of organisations that train and groom PwDs especially for the retail sector, the positives of hiring differently abled people far outweigh the negatives.</p>\n<p class="p3">In the past few years, specialised institutions such as the Ability Foundation, Pankh, Accessibility, the Samarthanam Trust and Enable India have been working to identify, educate and train PwDs to bridge the gap between them and employers. Pankh, started in May 2011 by BS Nagesh, vice-chairman at Shoppers Stop, and Meera Shenoy, founder of skilling NGO Youth4Jobs, trains youth with hearing and locomotor disabilities specifically for roles in the retail sector. It sources its expertise from the Trust for Retailers &amp; Retail Associates of India (Trrain), a retail group founded by Nagesh. Though most of these organisations run job fairs to bring PwDs to the notice of potential employers, many retailers also hire PwDs through referrals and walk-ins.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Bang for the buck- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">A case in point is the Caf&eacute; Coffee Day chain, which has been hiring PwDs for the past decade and even has an outlet in Sion, Mumbai, completely staffed by them. At CCD, HR policies for PwDs remain the same, as do growth prospects &mdash; some have gone on to become caf&eacute; managers. &ldquo;Till date, we have recruited more than 150 PwDs &mdash; most of them hearing impaired. These &lsquo;silent brewmasters&rsquo; tend to have a heightened sense of smell and vision, ensuring appealing presentation of our coffees through latte art. There is no difference in recruitment and training except for the presence of a sign language interpreter,&rdquo; says Balachandar Natarajan, group director, human resources, Coffee Day Group.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Natarajan says that apart from stringent quality control, CCD&rsquo;s PwD workers are also committed and focused &mdash; leading to gains through productivity. &ldquo;Some are so good at their brews that customers ask for them on repeat visits,&rdquo; he adds. The role of brewmasters fits PwDs well as there is limited customer interaction and less scope for confusion in orders.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>A good fit</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">QSRs apart, PwDs are also finding a niche in the retail industry. Out of a possible 110 roles in retail, PwDs can be successfully assimilated into some 30 roles such as manning cash counters, loading, shelving and inventory management, data entry, backroom operations and as customer service associates. Most of these require minimal interaction with customers and less intervention from the employer. At clothing chain Lifestyle, there are no tags to distinguish PwDs and, in case a customer needs clarifications, other workers step in. &ldquo;Some chains provide us with a list of personnel requirements and qualifications. We tailor the batches at Pankh accordingly, ensuring that every trainee graduates with a job,&rdquo; says Nagesh.</p>\n<p class="p3">For retailers, the investment in hiring PwDs is minimal. Most retail outlets already have disabled-friendly infrastructure, such as ramps and special restrooms, to make the store accessible for customers with locomotor disabilities. &ldquo;As we match roles closely to an individual&rsquo;s capability, workplace changes have been minimal. For example, a cashier with a lower limb disability may need a stool or hydraulic chair. But that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; says Mark Ashman, CEO, Hypercity. And the returns, in the form of brand loyalty, positive word of mouth among customers and a 50% reduction in attrition rates among recent hires more than make up for these alterations, says the Accenture report. Ashman can vouch for this. Hypercity, which began hiring PwDs two years ago, now has 35 employees and is looking to take this to 100 across its 15 stores. &ldquo;We have seen tangible benefits from this move, not just as reduced employee turnover but also in terms of great customer service. Though it is tough to quantify productivity gains so soon, PwDs routinely surpass our own standards, winning &lsquo;employee of the month&rsquo; and attendance awards,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Changing tide</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Of course, the going is not always that smooth, in customer reaction or in terms of retail chains&rsquo; own attitude towards disability. Pankh, which trains PwDs for posts at nearly 40 retail majors, has met with opposition from some chains, which do not understand disability and shy away from hiring PwDs, fearing it will be expensive. Most of them do not even have an inclusion policy. Shenoy cites the example of a qualified candidate who was rejected because he had only one hand, whereas the job required only the use of his eyes and voice. &ldquo;So, we began doing sensitisation workshops with CEOs and supervisors. And slowly but steadily, each company came back to us for more candidates,&rdquo; she adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The lack of career progression options in the limited roles open to them also leads to PwDs getting disillusioned about their future prospects in the industry. It doesn&rsquo;t help that only 1% of Indian PwDs actually have quality jobs. To make the recruitment process more rewarding for both companies and the disabled, Pankh and other NGOs are working to train the latter in varied roles across IT, hospitality and manufacturing sectors. &ldquo;We aim to help rehabilitate 1,200 PwDs in the next 12 months, up from the 600 who graduated from our six centres in the past three years,&rdquo; says Nagesh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Atul Sakhre is one such graduate. The 20-something from Jalna is hearing impaired and participated in Pankh&rsquo;s residential programme, which includes English language, computers and retail skills training. Now working as a cashier at Lifestyle, which has a total of 65 PwD employees, Sakhre sportingly explains how his job has helped instil a sense of discipline within him and helped him gain the self-assurance to approach people confidently. Lifestyle plans to hire 1,000 PwDs going forward, says R Venkatramana, president, HR, at the Landmark Group, which owns Lifestyle. It may be a small start, but the spike in returns is at least making retailers sit up and take notice of the specially abled.&nbsp;</p>', 'The attrition-ridden retail sector is hiring disabled people — and finding better returns', '12', '', 0, '', 'can-and-able-172', 167, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Can and able', 'The attrition-ridden retail sector is hiring disabled people — and finding better returns', '', '', '', 'Persons with disability,HR,Attrition,Pankh,Youth4Jobs,Hypercity,Cafe Coffee Day,Lifestyle', 0, NULL, '2015-01-21 11:25:20', '2015-01-21 11:35:57', '2014-03-15', 0);

Over the past one year, the share price of the stock has gone by over 36%, from Rs 129 to Rs 176 levels.

In the current fiscal, for the nine months ending in December, Dabur has managed a strong 10% growth in volumes, with rural sales staying robust. Analysts expect the company to post a decent 15%-17% growth both in topline and bottomline in the coming fiscal.

JLR, which was bought in 2008 from Ford Motor Co for $2.3 billion, besides accounting for 80% of the auto maker&rsquo;s earnings, also continues to be its topline driver. In fact, for the just concluded third quarter, consolidated revenues were up at Rs 63,877 crore, driven by a 61.1% y-o-y increase in revenues in rupee terms at JLR, while consolidated profit was up 173% to Rs 4,929 crore, driven by record operating margins of 18%. While the volume performance was backed by the new launches (Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, Jaguar F type, XF Sportbrake and smaller engine options of XF and XJ), net average realisation growth was led by favourable product-mix (higher share of Range Rover and Range Rover Sport) and richer geography mix (higher share of China).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In contrast to JLR&rsquo;s performance, the domestic standalone business plunged to a new low. Revenues declined 27% to Rs 7,770 crore following a 36% drop in volumes to 130,337 &mdash; an 18-quarter low. Tata Motors reported an operating loss of Rs 460 crore owing to high fixed costs, heavy discounting and low volumes. This is the first-ever Ebitda loss in more than a decade for the company. The domestic business ended on a bloody note &mdash; adjusted loss of Rs 670 crore, the highest ever in the company&rsquo;s history. The only saving grace during the quarter was an exceptional profit of Rs 1,948 crore on account of sale of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries to the overseas holding company, TML Holdings Singapore, and tax write-backs of Rs 630 crore, which led to the reported profit at Rs 1,251 crore.</p>\n<p class="p3">Though Tata Motors, after a four-year hiatus, unveiled two new models for the domestic market, the timeline for their launch is not clear. It is already losing market share in the PV market, down at 8.5% as of December 2013 against 14% in FY12.</p>\n<p class="p3">Interestingly, the analyst community is upbeat on the stock given JLR&rsquo;s performance and the launch of the domestic models.

(175, 20, '', 'Piping hot', '<p class="p1">On a balmy winter morning in early 2010, it was work as usual for Vimal Katta as he strode into his office located on the relatively busy Naranpura Char Rasta road in Ahmedabad. No sooner did he plonk down in his chair that the finance director of Ratnamani Metals &amp; Tubes got a call on his landline. The inquisitive voice on the other end sought to know more about the company and its business, and a few minutes into the conversation, Katta realised that this was not a routine sales enquiry but a business call of a different kind. As it turned out, the person on the other end was calling from Nalanda Capital, the Singapore-based boutique investment firm of Pulak Prasad, who earned his spurs during his previous stint with Warburg Pincus.</p>\n<p class="p3">To jog your memory, it was Prasad who fetched a near six-time killing for Warburg on its initial investment of $292 million in Bharti Airtel, which is today the largest telecom player in the country with over 200 million subscribers and over 28% market share at the end of January 2014. Prasad quit the New York-based private equity major in 2006 to float his own firm, raising over $400 million from investors. Since then, Nalanda, or rather, Prasad, has been investing in publicly listed companies, especially mid caps, which make the cut based on the following investing tenets: a company should enjoy high return ratios, should have a good management with a proven track record and a robust business model.</p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s not surprising then, that Katta got the call. Because Ratnamani Metals, despite being in the unsexy commoditised business of manufacturing stainless steel and carbon steel pipes for petroleum, power and other infra sectors, is one hell of an efficiently run company. With a turnover of over Rs 1,200 crore, it&rsquo;s the smallest player in the industry but also the most profitable. As expected, a team flew down from Singapore for a closer interaction with the management, seeking details about its vision and plan, key customers and competitors. The team visit was soon followed by a personal visit by none other than Prasad, who wanted a first-hand account of what Ratnamani was all about. Satisfied with what it saw and heard, Nalanda eventually went on to own a significant minority stake in the company, which today has a market cap of over Rs 700 crore. From a little over 1% stake four years back, Nalanda currently owns an 11% stake in the company.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Small is beautiful- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">So, what exactly is it about Ratnamani that has enamoured Prasad? Because barring Kenneth Andrade, the star mid-cap fund manager from IDFC Mutual Fund, no other fund manager seems to have an exposure to the stock.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>League of its own</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Sitting in his modest office, Ratnamani Metals promoter Prakash Sanghvi is counting his blessings that he is not facing the same pangs that his peers in the business are currently feeling. More than Lady Luck, it is Sanghvi&rsquo;s prudent streak that is now helping the company tide the slowdown that seems to have permeated to every corner of the economy, especially the core industries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">To begin with, Ratnamani Metals started out as a manufacturer of stainless steel tubes in October 1985 and gradually diversified into carbon steel in 1994. But it was during the boom-bust cycle of FY05-FY08 that the company really came into its own, and thanks to a reality check, managed to stay the course through the subsequent slowdown. &ldquo;We had a good time back then, as the whole petroleum sector was going through a boom phase and crude prices kept hitting new highs. It was around this time that we started adding more capacity in the carbon steel segment, even as the other domestic players were far more aggressive in their approach,&rdquo; reflects the 58-year-old.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Blowing hot, blowing cold- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">What appeared to be a recipe for success soon turned out to be a disaster for the pipeline industry. The global contagion took the wind out of effervescent crude prices, forcing global majors in the petroleum sector, the biggest demand driver for pipelines, to shelve their expansion plans. The net effect: the domestic pipe industry was left grappling with overcapacity, which was compounded by the fact that a lot of it was funded by leverage, taking a heavy toll on the bottomline. But that&rsquo;s not the case with Ratnamani. &ldquo;Unlike my bigger brothers in the business, Welspun, Jindal Saw and the likes, my capacity is still minuscule and is not hurting,&rdquo; points out Sanghvi. The reason is not difficult to fathom, as with a stainless steel capacity of 27,000 metric tonne (20,000 for welded pipes and 7,000 for seamless pipes) and 350,000 tonne of carbon steel, Ratnamani today is small in an industry that has over 8 million tonne capacity. &ldquo;Unlike others, who are either pure stainless steel or carbon steel players, we have an equal split between both segments. Also, in the carbon steel segment, the capacity is split across four product lines,&rdquo; points out Sanghvi. The four products are: LSAW (longitudinal submerged arc welded) 40,000 tonne; ERW (electric resistance welded) 70,000 tonne; HSAW (helical submerged arc welded&nbsp;pipes) 180,000 tonne; and CSAW (circumferential submerged arc welded) 60,000 tonne.</p>\n<p class="p3">While the company did not resort to costly borrowings to fund its expansion, a drop in utilisation rates, thanks to weak demand, has taken a toll on return ratios. While the going was good, ROE went from 29% in FY05 to 59% in FY07, but after the 2008 crisis, it slipped to 21% in FY11. Putting the decline in context, Katta explains, &ldquo;Low margin carbon steel pipe segments such as line pipes and ERW have not given the returns one would have expected.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">After the crisis, the company exercised greater prudence. &ldquo;We have consciously turned conservative, concentrating on only those segments where we see good potential for growth. We are now focusing on the stainless segment and high-value products to ensure that returns stay healthy,&rdquo; mentions Katta. Between FY10 and FY13, even as revenues doubled, the return ratio (ROE) moved up from 21% to 23%. This is largely because the bulk of operating profits are flowing down to the bottomline, thanks to a manageable debt of around Rs 136 crore and minimal inventory. &ldquo;The weighted average cost of our borrowings is just around 9%,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Future tense- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">But more importantly, the company does not hoard raw materials unless there is a clear visibility on orders. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t speculate because we are in a business that is largely of a made-to-order nature. We book materials as and when the order is ready to be executed,&rdquo; says Sanghvi. That approach has ensured that the company enjoys the best operating margins of around 20% compared with its rivals. The difference is stark if we consider that big brother Welspun Corporation &mdash; five times Ratnamani&rsquo;s size &mdash; enjoys 9% margins.</p>\n<p class="p3">Talking about what is helping the firm cope with the slowdown, Sanghvi points out, &ldquo;We sell highly customised niche high value-added products. For instance, we are one of the few manufacturers in the world who make long tubes, up to 36 m in length, for the oil and gas and petrochemical industry. We are the only makers of titanium welded steel tubes [which do not get corroded] in India selling to desalination and UMPP power plants located along the shores.&rdquo; Keeping that in mind, the firm is in the last stage of its capex expansion that will increase its stainless steel capacity to 29,000 tonne by June of the next fiscal year.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Future tense</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">While Ratnamani appears to be sitting pretty compared with other players, it continues to face the same challenges that the industry faces &mdash; lack of clear growth opportunities. Though there are no analysts tracking the stock, rating agency Care in a report on the pipeline sector portrays a rosy picture of what lies ahead. Care Research estimates global and domestic SAW pipe demand for Indian manufacturers (excluding replacement demand) at 16 million tonne ($19.45 billion) over the next five years from the oil and gas sector alone. Demand from the replacement market is likely to be 10.4 million tonne over the next five years, since most of the pipes laid during the 1960s and 1970s in the US and other developed nations will need replacement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">So far so good, but the reality is that orders are hard to come by, thanks to the controversy over natural gas pricing, and the delayed construction in other user industries such as power, because of environment issues. In terms of exports orders, there is not enough demand. Barring FY12, where revenues bumped up 50% y-o-y, Ratnamani has seen growth decline in FY10, FY11 and FY13. However, the company&rsquo;s management feels that there is light at the end of the tunnel. &ldquo;We have an order book of around Rs 778 crore, of which Rs 221 crore comprise exports and Rs 557 crore are domestic orders. We should end the year at around Rs 1,300 crore,&rdquo; points out Katta. Of the current order book, #250 crore will be converted into sales by end-FY14 and the balance Rs 528 crore will be carried forward into the new fiscal year.</p>\n<p class="p3">But going ahead, the visibility of new orders is far from clear. Though Sanghvi is bullish on Reliance&rsquo;s publicly stated plans of investing over Rs 50,000 crore in the oil and gas business &mdash; that is expected to translate into a big order opportunity &mdash; the controversy over gas pricing remains a big overhang over the proposed expansion. Besides, the power industry, yet another big client for pipelines, is in a rut, something Sanghvi concurs with. &ldquo;A lot will depend on whether our customers are in a position to tie up their financial closure and pick up materials.&rdquo; The bigger worry for Sanghvi is that if the domestic scenario deteriorates further post the general elections, the effect will be felt in the exports market as well. &ldquo;Increasing footprint in global market takes time, but once global clients realise that there is no domestic market for you back home, they can really start arm-twisting you, and that&rsquo;s not a good situation for the pipeline industry,&rdquo; he opines.</p>\n<p class="p3">So it&rsquo;s not surprising that against such a backdrop, Ratnamani is not under the active coverage of brokerages, what with the stock ending nearly flat in CY13. Also, its relatively smaller industry presence, small market capitalisation and poor liquidity do not make the cut for domestic fund managers. &ldquo;While it is no doubt an efficient player and does not have leverage issues, unless the overall business environment really improves, there is nothing much that Ratnamani can achieve in the current conditions,&rdquo; points out a fund manager on the condition of anonymity. But that&rsquo;s something Sanghvi is ready to live with. &ldquo;I am not obsessed with growth but rather with profitable growth.&rdquo; If one were to consider that while the topline has grown just one-fold over FY10-FY13, profits have gone from Rs 82 crore to Rs 136 crore, Sanghvi is not far from the truth.</p>\n<p class="p3">Though estimates are not available, if one were to extrapolate the average 18% growth in profit between FY10 and FY13 to FY14, the stock is trading at around 4.45 times estimated earnings per share of Rs 34.38 (Rs 29.14 in FY13). Considering that the stock price has been flat in CY13, there is more to see on the upside than the downside. If indeed Ratnamani were to live up to its tagline &mdash; &ldquo;prosperity through performance&rdquo; &mdash; then investors have nothing to really worry about.&nbsp;</p>', 'It''s the smallest player, but Ratnamani Metals & Tubes has proved its mettle in a recession-hit pipeline business', '11', '', 0, '', 'piping-hot-175', 170, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Piping hot', 'It''s the smallest player, but Ratnamani Metals & Tubes has proved its mettle in a recession-hit pipeline business', '', '', '', 'Ratnamani Metals & Tubes,Vimal Katta,Pulak Prasad,Prakash Sanghvi', 0, NULL, '2015-01-21 12:08:31', '2015-01-21 12:11:39', '2014-03-15', 0),

From the scorching deserts of Africa to the freezing vistas of the North Pole and Antarctica, the 60-year-old and his wife, Uma, have run marathons on all seven continents, thereby ensuring a place for themselves in the Guinness World Records as the only Indian couple to have done so.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;I was never a fitness freak. In fact, I never used to exercise regularly. A decade back, even walking for a few kilometres used to feel like an uphill task,&rdquo; says Hyderabad-based Chigurupati, who finally started running at the insistence of juniors at work. &ldquo;Some of my colleagues had signed up for a 10-km run in Hyderabad and coaxed me to join as well. That was my first run,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There was no looking back after that. Chigurupati and his wife started running marathons and half-marathons across the country and, then, in cities around the world. But soon after, the initial excitement started wearing thin. On a research trip to California for their other interest &mdash; wine &mdash; the Chigurupatis signed up for the LA marathon on a whim. &ldquo;It was only after completing the run that we realised we were done running city marathons. We needed adverse conditions &mdash; to put it nicely &mdash; to keep the excitement levels up,&rdquo; smiles Chigurupati.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">So the couple set its sights on the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya next. &ldquo;There were people and animals running together.

There, the Chigurupatis met a man who had already run marathons on all seven continents and whose last stop was Lewa. &ldquo;We were really inspired by his feat and decided to do the same.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Chigurupati says besting their personal times was never the target for him or his wife. Instead, they had made up their minds to run marathons on all seven continents within a single calendar year. So in 2010, the couple took off on its mission, running renowned courses such as the Australian Outback Marathon, the Porto Marathon in Portugal, the Buenos Aires International Marathon, Argentina, and the International Gobi Marathon in Mongolia. The last destination was Antarctica, their toughest experience by far.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;The temperature was around -17 degree Celsius and we had no experience of running on ice or snow. We had only practised for about 6-7 km wearing the warmest clothes we had,&rdquo; he says. Once they had experienced the Antarctic chill, they couldn&rsquo;t leave the North Pole unconquered. So, a few months later, they ran a marathon there as well. &ldquo;At that time, the temperature was a balmy -34 degree Celsius and I was a 56-year-old man. But I did it.&rdquo; Chigurupati credits his marathon obsession for keeping age-related ailments away.</p>\n<p class="p3">Though the couple has whittled down the annual marathon list to two or three key events, Chigurupati feels they still have some milestones to cross &mdash; among them the New York and Berlin marathons &mdash; which &ldquo;require a lifetime of preparation&rdquo;.

(178, 24, '', 'Suits, spoken for', '<p class="p1"><span class="s1">W</span>hat&rsquo;s bespoke? Till recently, I would have said, with some degree of confidence, that it&rsquo;s something made-to-measure, or on order. Even the Merriam-Webster dictionary defines bespoke as &ldquo;producing clothes to fit a particular person&rdquo;. Designer Ashish Soni disagrees. Made-to-measure, being offered by major brands in Mumbai and Delhi, is something designed from an existing block later adjusted to your frame. Nothing wrong with that, of course, only it isn&rsquo;t bespoke, which is designed to flatter your personality, because it is fully created to meet a specific need. In his words, &ldquo;There is nothing quite like the feeling of putting on a suit created specially for you, one that has been worked on for hours to perfect every detail so as to achieve an impeccable garment.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Soni showed off his bespoke credentials with a curated evening at the French ambassador&rsquo;s residence in the capital recently, where mannequins wore suits in various stages of preparation, taking one through the work that goes into the making of such a suit. But whether bespoke or made-to-measure, there are some things common to every good suit that Soni suggests you look out for.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<span class="s2"><strong>The cut:</strong></span> &ldquo;Opt for a simple, well-cut jacket close to the body, slim but not tight.&rdquo; Wide shoulders, a full chest and an &ldquo;unabashedly&rdquo; narrow waist, he points out, has stood the test of time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<span class="s2"><strong>The cloth: </strong></span>Never pick anything without &ldquo;character&rdquo;. Soni suggests something with silk in the weave, or a discreet self-pattern, even something with a bit of a shine &mdash; the Italians love this &mdash; and a wardrobe should have at least three basic colours.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<span class="s2"><strong>Comfort:</strong></span> Slim-fitting or not, a suit is something you wear for an extended length of time, so comfort is critical. He suggests it should feel like &ldquo;a second skin, not a suit of armour&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<span class="s2"><strong>Dress for the weather: </strong></span>Breezy cotton and linen suits are perfect for Indian weather &mdash; yes, even winter, but depending on the fabric&rsquo;s density or &ldquo;super number&rdquo; (with a higher number denoting a finer fabric), even wool suits can be worn year-round. Wool doesn&rsquo;t crease but, personally, I like the crushed elegance of linen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<span class="s2"><strong>Check the lapel:</strong></span> Hold it between your fingers and rub the fabric. If you can feel the layers of the fabric rustle, you&rsquo;re looking at something remarkable. If it&rsquo;s fused, it&rsquo;s part of the mass-manufactured industry.</p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><strong>Wear your vent:</strong></span> For a brief while, vents went out of fashion, so suits resembled sacks. Back vents are essential. Whether you choose the American-style central vent, or the European double vent is up to you &mdash; or your designer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<span class="s2"><strong>Check the sleeve lining: </strong></span>If it is hand-stitched in the inner seam where the arm meets the body, the shoulder will fit more closely.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<span class="s2"><strong>Sag-free inner pocket:</strong></span> The internal left breast pocket must be set off by strips of external fabric for reinforcing, to take the load of your wallet, glasses, whatever.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;Soni points out that nobody is a perfect, off-the-rack size, which is where made-to-measure or bespoke make a difference. At his atelier, there is a stylist and a bespoke manager, personal considerations are taken into account and the head designer offers tips.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Some things, though, are universal. The coat lapel should be cut such that you can wear a shirt collar with or without a tie in a manner where the shirt collar does not jut out awkwardly; too much of a shirt must not be visible. The shirtsleeves must peep out of the jacket sleeve. And a gentleman always wears cufflinks. A double cuff is merely a personal preference. If buying off-the-rack, if the shoulder feels tight instead of snug, opt for the next size. When you button a jacket, it should let you breathe and never buy a jacket with a slim fit if your paunch peeps through.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Oh, and a gentleman always hitches his trousers at the knees when sitting down, to relieve the pressure and ensure that the trousers do not develop a snag. And unbutton your jacket button(s) when sitting down and button them up again when standing up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>&mdash;The author is a Delhi-based writer and curator</strong></p>', 'Fashion designer Ashish Soni''s guide to the bespoke suit', '17', '', 0, '', 'suits-spoken-for-178', 173, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Suits, spoken for', 'Fashion designer Ashish Soni''s guide to the bespoke suit', '', '', '', 'Bespoke suit,Ashish Soni', 0, NULL, '2015-01-21 12:22:31', '2015-01-21 12:28:38', '2014-03-15', 0),
(179, 24, '', 'All that glitters', '<p class="p1">Gold and crime go hand in hand&hellip; The schemes that spook the gold trade can&rsquo;t be sorted out so simply. They are the shadowy events, the phantoms rippling through the tall grass of the business, not clearly visible or understood, and sowing panic for that very reason. One such passage shook the market for two weeks in July 2010, when a massive, unexplained transaction parked a load of bullion in a place where those who monitor such movements did not expect to find it. When they discovered it, their confusion about why it was there was deepened by the stubborn silence of a little known Swiss bank, The Bank for International Settlements, or BIS. Headquartered in Basel, BIS is sometimes called the central bankers&rsquo; bank, because that&rsquo;s where they go to borrow. &hellip; The cause of the panic was a footnote to the bank&rsquo;s annual report. The note revealed that a bank or group of banks had lent 349 metric tons of gold to BIS in exchange for cash. The deal was so colossal &mdash; a sixth of the world&rsquo;s annual production &mdash; that the news of it, without elucidation, stunned the bullion market. Who had lent the gold, and why? Was a bank in trouble? Could it be a central bank? What did they know that the bullion market didn&rsquo;t? As questions thickened the air, investors started bailing out of gold, and the price lost $40 in a day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Here&rsquo;s why the price went down. The deal looked like a swap &mdash; an exchange of gold for cash, with an agreement that the gold would be redeemed at a later date&hellip; For whoever swapped it, the gold raised $14 billion. What bothered the gold market was the question of what would happen to the gold if the $14 billion didn&rsquo;t get paid back. The price was down anyway, depressed by a period of selling by ETFs. Would the 349 tons suddenly appear for sale if the swapper couldn&rsquo;t manage the loan? A 380-ton gold dump would annihilate the price.</p>\n<p class="p3">Suspicion swirled about who might need the cash. There were plenty of candidates. Fear of European countries reneging on their debts was in the air already, and this fear suggested an explanation for the swap. A central bank desperately needed cash.</p>\n<p class="p3">For a while, that&rsquo;s what everyone I spoke to thought &mdash; Greece or Spain or some other monetary basket case was being hooked up to life support. But then Edel Tully, an analyst at UBS, pointed out that it couldn&rsquo;t be a central bank. European regulations, she said, did not allow a central bank to transfer funds to its government or to buy the government&rsquo;s bonds &mdash; the actions they would have to perform to stave off a default. Not a central bank, then, but some other monetary authority. On her list of suspects, Tully placed the International Monetary Fund. Suspicion switched to the IMF.</p>\n<p class="p3">The fund is the world&rsquo;s banker of last resort. It had bailed out Iceland, the first sovereign meltdown of the financial crisis. The IMF had been &ldquo;quietly selling off its gold&rdquo; position anyway, according to the <em>Telegraph</em>&hellip; No sooner did opinion settle on the IMF, than the BIS itself torpedoed it. It was not the IMF, or even a central bank, that had swapped the bullion, they said in Basel, but a commercial bank or banks. If this announcement was supposed to calm the market, it failed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Insights</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Business groups are a-changin''</strong></span></p>\n<p class="p1">In the age of open markets, the hold that big business groups used to have over the US has eased into a smattering of smaller, closely controlled corporates, which take care not to channel all resources into one sector.

It started about 10 years ago as a pain in his lower back. The pain would steadily increase by the day, until one day when he tried lifting something and couldn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;I began to get numbness in my fingers, and soon it spread to my entire body,&rdquo; the 63-year-old recalls. His younger brother had died after similar symptoms, so, in 2006, Yadav&rsquo;s son took him to Delhi. After an MRI scan that showed nerve compression, the doctor said it was the increased fluoride level in the water that was causing his problems. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t move or eat food or even turn. I tried many treatments, including Ayurveda and yoga in nearby Sikar, but nothing seemed to work,&rdquo; says the former forest contractor. He admits that since Sarvajal brought its purified water system to nearby Bagar in 2008, there has been an improvement. &ldquo;I can now walk for a few metres. Earlier, someone had to help with everything.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Against a normal acceptable TDS (total dissolved solids or impurities) level of 50-150 ppm for packaged or purified water, TDS levels in Pacheri&rsquo;s ground water have been at 2,500-3,000 ppm, according to a Sarvajal officer. Mahendra Singh, 51, and Raj Singh Yadav, 53, together run the local franchise for Sarvajal at Pacheri Khurd. They sell purified water at 25 paise a litre, less than the 30 paise per litre price stipulated by the company. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it costs us. My objective was to do social work,&rdquo; Singh says of his decision.</p>\n<p class="p3">For companies in the water business in India, the social aspect is an inevitable corollary. The numbers speak for themselves: the per capita water availability is about 1,545 cubic metres per year according to the 2011 Census, and declining progressively, where a country is considered water-stressed if less than 1,700 cubic metres is available per person per year. Importantly, the World Health Organisation estimates that around 97 million Indians lack access to safe water, while newspaper reports say only two Indian cities have continuous water supply; all others get water for a few hours every day. It is a crisis waiting to explode but, meanwhile, it is also a business opportunity for companies such as Sarvajal, Waterlife and Spring Health, among many others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Open source</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">&ldquo;Water and health linkages are not easily understood in rural areas,&rdquo; says Sarvajal COO Anuj Sharma. He points to the presence of bacterial contaminants as well as chemicals such as arsenic and fluoride due to agricultural and industrial pollution. &ldquo;These are hard-to-remove chemicals and cause irreversible damage. Prevention is the only cure,&rdquo; he says, adding that it takes time to convince villagers of the dangers of contaminated water and gain acceptance for water projects. &ldquo;You can fall sick in one day, but the positive effects take time to show.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Water and health linkages are not easily understood. You can fall sick in a day, but the positive effects take time to show" - Anuj Sharma, COO, Sarvajal</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Sarvajal was launched in 2008 as a CSR project by the Piramal Foundation in the family&rsquo;s ancestral village of Bagar, Rajasthan. It is now a growing business with 179 installations of its RO-based purification system, which serve around 100,000 customers every day. The foundation has invested #40 lakh in the venture, which is yet to show a profit, although Sarvajal is currently recovering its service and operational costs. &ldquo;It is seeded and funded by the Foundation as a for-profit to prove the point that this is a self-sustaining model,&rdquo; says Sharma. Over the years, the business model has evolved and the 179 locations now include 124 locations where the filtration unit is owned by Piramal Foundation, another 20 where the franchisees own the machines and the rest are corporate/CSR locations such as at AIIMS and DTC in Delhi, and HDFC Ergo, among others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Sarvajal element</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Started with a rural focus, Sarvajal now aims to replicate its hub-and-spoke model with a plant and dispensing machines &mdash; water ATMs &mdash; in urban areas as well, to address limitations with traditional piped water supply in serving the growing population in and around cities. It also works with other coporate organisations by installing filtration units in corporate campuses and for their CSR activities. Sarvajal&rsquo;s project in Savda Ghevra, a resettlement colony near the Haryana border in the western fringes of Delhi, is &ldquo;India&rsquo;s first decentralised drinking water tender in an urban area,&rdquo; says Sharma. With a source water TDS of 1500-1800 ppm, Sarvajal&rsquo;s service, which started in 2013, already has over 400 paying members buying water from its 15 water ATMS here. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Sarvajal&rsquo;s purified water is sold at 30 paise per litre. Many NGO-driven projects in water offer purified water at even lower prices, but Sharma says the machine operators in those cases aren&rsquo;t incentivised, with the result that the unit isn&rsquo;t viable and soon shuts down. &ldquo;While philanthropic money goes into filtration plants, nobody knows how many hours they actually work on the field.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">The answer is technology. Sarvajal&rsquo;s water purification plants are equipped with a GSM-based remote sensing equipment called Soochak. It interacts with a backend control system, enabling remote monitoring of the purification plants from its Ahmedabad call centre. A cloud-based system, it also allows monitoring to be done remotely from a laptop or computer. The local Sarvajal manager, too, is informed of any malfunction or issues with the purification system or water refills in the dispensing machines through alerts on his mobile phone. To prevent cash leakages, the water ATMs allow cashless transactions through an RFID card.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Sarvajal&rsquo;s treatment plant for a 1,000-household community comes for less than Rs 10 lakh and has an average lifespan of eight to 10 years. The water ATMs are priced between Rs 50,000 and Rs 1.25 lakh and the revenue share varies on the ownership model: with company-owned machines, the franchisees pay 12 paise per litre of water that&rsquo;s filtered; those franchisees who own the machines pay 6 paise per litre of water filtered.</p>\n<p class="p3">Sarvajal expects to see increased demand from companies that would like to set up clean water facilities as part of their CSR initiatives. Sharma is most bullish about Sarvajal&rsquo;s technology and the fact that the plants and ATMs run on solar power, which gives the company access to markets deep in rural and power-starved areas. &ldquo;We are also trying to connect entrepreneurs with banks for preferential lending rates to get more people on board.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Joining hands</strong></p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Waterlife element</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Like Saravajal, Waterlife, too, operates RO-based water purification systems in rural areas of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, UP, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. It also works in the slums of Puducherry, Bengaluru, Ranchi and Kolkata. Funded by Aavishkaar and Matrix Partners, Waterlife was started in 2006 by three senior corporate executives &mdash; Sudesh Menon, formerly GE&rsquo;s South East Asia head, and Mohan Ranbaore and Indranil Das from Xerox. &ldquo;The key was the business model, not so much the technology; how to make it work in rural areas and execute in difficult conditions,&rdquo; says Menon. &ldquo;We have been profitable from the first year of operations.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s been possible because Waterlife partners with local governments to fund the cost of its filtration systems, which cost between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 20 lakh. It has over 100 projects in operation where it helps set up community water stations and units for treatment of water for fluoride, nitrate and other high TDS contaminants, which reach out to over 4,000 villages with population between 500 and 20,000. In remote areas, Waterlife provides contamination removal units that can be attached to handpumps.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With users paying Rs 3-5 for a 20-litre can of water, Waterlife plans to grow at a CAGR of 70% over the next few years. &ldquo;We can scale rapidly. We are trying to solve a social problem with the discipline of a business,&rdquo; says Menon.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Back to basics</strong></p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Spring Health- element</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Not all drinking water initiatives are capital intensive. Spring Health is creating an alternative option through the simple and basic process of chlorination. Spring Health is part of Windhorse International, founded by US-based social entrepreneur Paul Polack. It is funded by a group of investors, including First Light Ventures, Acumen Fund (which had invested in the pilot stage and has now exited), Calvert Fund, Phil Friedmann Foundation, Chris Goggin, Mal Warwick, Rianta Capital and Stone Foundation, who have brought in $550,000 to the venture, so far. The project is spread across 107 villages in six districts of Odisha, where drinking water is sold at 40 paise per litre. After months of testing, the commercial rollout for Spring Health began in June 2013. The franchisee, usually a popular kirana, mobile or medical store, is signed on for two years. &ldquo;In the past four months, we have added 73 villages, averaging around one village a day,&rdquo; says Spring Health CEO Kishan Nanavati.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"In the past four months, we have added 73 villages, averaging around one village a day" - Kishan Nanavati, CEO, Spring Health</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Spring Health purifies water removing bacterial contamination using chlorination. &ldquo;We are not in a position to address chemical and mineral contamination, so we look at water table depth of not more than 30 ft,&rdquo; points out Nanavati. The water is tested at government-approved labs for pH level, presence of iron, nitrates, sulphur, fluoride, arsenic and bacterial contamination before it is considered for use. At the franchisee&rsquo;s location, the water runs through two filters into a storage tank above, where it is treated with chlorine oxidants and tested before being made available for drinking. Spring Health&rsquo;s team also carries out random tests at point of consumption in customers&rsquo; homes. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Typically, a deliveryman takes 20 jars of 10 litres each in jerry cans on an autorickshaw or cycle rickshaw and goes on a beat schedule on a daily basis. Ideally, he serves a catchment of 500-600 homes, including tiny hamlets, within a 2 km radius of the village kiosk. So far, Spring Health has established its water kiosks in 165 villages of Odisha, serving about 17,400 families, and selling 3.4 million litres of clean drinking water in December 2013 alone, says Nanavati. The plan is to reach 6,000 villages in the state in five years, and 10,000 villages across India by 2018. This year, Spring Health will expand into either Bihar, Jharkhand or eastern Uttar Pradesh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It won&rsquo;t be easy, Nanavati admits: there&rsquo;s a fair bit of resistance to selling of water. &ldquo;The first question they ask is, &lsquo;Why should we buy your water when we have ponds, wells and rivulets behind our homes from where we have been drinking all our lives?&rsquo;&rdquo; To address this, it conducts water testing <em>melas</em>, taking village water samples, incubating and showing villagers the bacteria in regular water, and comparing with the purified water. &ldquo;We show them cue cards, visually informing them about the presence of bacteria and E.coli in their village water &mdash; which they drink straight &mdash; and the side effects.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Spring Health often partners with local self-help groups (SHGs) to reach out to its rural customers. &ldquo;Odisha has the largest number of NGOs in the country. Some health awareness is already there,&rdquo; says Nanavati. A dedicated marketing team stays on in the village for a couple of days after installation to promote the service door-to-door, and performs a skit in the evenings on safe water for a healthy family. There have been some surprises along the way too. Spring Health expected the predominantly Muslim residents of Kerang village in Khurda to be very conservative in taking to this project. It was quite the opposite. &ldquo;It is now one of our top five villages in terms of sales.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Spring Health works with franchisees on a staggered revenue share plan. From launch to reaching 1,250 litres, it makes 75% of the revenues generated from sale of the chlorinated drinking water. Once the franchisee crosses 1,250 litres and up to 2,000 litres, the share is 50:50. Over 2,000 litres of water sold, the franchisee makes 75% of revenues generated.</p>\n<p class="p3">Currently, it is reaching one household in five in the villages it serves. &ldquo;In the next year, we should reach 33% and in three years, we aim to reach 50%,&rdquo; says Nanavati. In FY13, the company made close to Rs 30 lakh and the business is expected to turn in profits by FY16.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The rural market has its own challenges, though. Caste considerations can be a trigger point. To avoid any conflict between upper and lower castes (who are often not permitted to share common water resources), Spring Health started home delivery of water to the Dalit households in one village. The other communities then promptly demanded home delivery for themselves. Today, 95% of the water is delivered at customers&rsquo; homes. The jerry can stays with the customers, reassuring them that no one else has touched the water. For the company, it is a time-saving move, since customers are responsible for cleaning their own jerry cans.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The market is big and there is no single player who can solve the problem of water in rural areas" - Sudesh Menon, co-founder, Waterlife</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">India&rsquo;s drinking water problem will take more than a few projects to crack, given its scale and complexity.&nbsp; &ldquo;The market is big and there is no single player who can solve it,&rdquo; says Menon.

(183, 15, '', 'Taking on the giants', '<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s about 5 pm on a weekend and all four floors of the Vijay Sales store at Kandivli, a west Mumbai suburb, are teeming with people looking at electronics purchases. Amid this crowd, it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising if a solitary older gentleman, dressed simply in trousers and an untucked shirt, were overlooked. But as soon as he walks in, an employee rushes forward to greet him. He strolls around and gestures to another member of the staff, who listens intently and immediately hurries to lower the volume and change channels on the television sets blaring all around. A couple of shoppers turn to look curiously at what makes this seemingly unremarkable senior so special. At 77, Nanu Gupta may have passed on the day-to-day management of the Vijay Sales chain of electronics stores to his two sons, but he is still very involved with the business he started 46 years ago. He visits the chain&rsquo;s 24 stores in Mumbai at least once a month and employees point out that on exceptionally busy days, Gupta even chips in as salesman and mans the cash register.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Those days are few and far between, though. The Rs 1,700-crore company employs more than 1,500 people across 54 stores in five states. Each store deals with close to 300 to 500 shoppers every day, about 60% of whom end up buying something from the 9,000 items on display &mdash; from mobile phones to home theatre systems, mixers to cooking ranges, washing machines to televisions. This year, the Mumbai-headquartered chain will add another eight to 10 stores in Maharashtra, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. It aims to close FY14 with net sales of Rs 2,200 crore, having grown for the past five years at about 30% CAGR. A far cry from the one-man operation that Gupta started in 1967 in a store so small he had to fold up his chair to make room for customers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Starting small</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Vijay Sales came into being not so much because Gupta had a burning desire to be an entrepreneur as from his fear of losing his job. Born and raised in Haryana, Gupta moved to Bombay in 1954 as an 18-year-old straight out of school and started work as a distributor for Usha International. Although he worked with the sewing machine and electric fans company for close to 13 years, Gupta recalls constantly worrying about job security. &ldquo;I used to be scared all the time, wondering what would happen if the arrangement fell through. That&rsquo;s when I decided to start my own business,&rdquo; he says. In 1967, with Rs 10,000 borrowed from family and friends, he started Vijay Sales Corporation, named after his younger brother whom he took on as partner, and opened the first Vijay Television Store at Mahim. The name notwithstanding, the store &mdash; a tiny, 50 sq ft outlet &mdash; sold sewing machines, fans and radios in addition to black-and-white television sets. &ldquo;We had brands such as Bharat TV and later, Dyanora, Crown and Standard. TV sales helped set up the foundation of the current business,&rdquo; Gupta recalls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Vijay Sales - Element</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">By 1981, when the electronics business was renamed Vijay Sales, the Mahim store had already expanded six-fold and over the next several years, Gupta opened branches of his electronics superstore across several Mumbai suburbs. &ldquo;When we opened our Goregaon store in 1998, at 1,500 sq ft, it was our largest at the time. People said we had lost our mind, since there were hardly any electronics available at the time to display. Today, that store seems too small,&rdquo; laughs Gupta. Now, Vijay Sales stores &mdash; all company-owned, incidentally &mdash; range from 4,000-25,000 sq ft, with an average store size of 7,000-8,000 sq ft.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"When we opened a 1,500 sq ft store in 1998, people said we had lost our mind. Now, that store seems too small" - Nanu Gupta, founder and chairman, Vijay Sales</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">How did Vijay Sales grow to become one of the biggest consumer electronics retail chains in western India? First, its sourcing strategy was significantly different from other electronics outlets. Gupta was aware how unsold inventory could quickly choke a retailer&rsquo;s cash flow. Accordingly, when he set up his business, he took goods on credit from manufacturers and paid for them only after they were sold. While most brands of the time, such as Usha and Bharat, agreed to this, some such as Philips refused to extend credit to retailers &mdash; in such cases, Gupta invested the profits from other sales to buy and stock these big-name brands. Even now, Vijay Sales has a mixed supply structure, where products are bought from big brands and taken on credit from newer players. It has a network of nine warehouses across India, which, based on a city&rsquo;s demand and octroi structure, stock 30 days&rsquo; inventory and ship out goods to customers. A significant chunk of the profits is ploughed back into the business and invested in areas such as customer service. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t trust my business enough to invest in it, why should anyone else trust it?&rdquo; asks Gupta, rhetorically.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There&rsquo;s also the emphasis on customer service &mdash; in the early years, Gupta would himself visit customers&rsquo; homes for product demos. Vijay Sales was also among the early retailers to have its own delivery vans, a service it began offering in the early 1980s when it started selling larger white goods such as refrigerators, washing machines and air-conditioners. Now, the delivery service is outsourced to local logistics players in different cities, who together run 150 branded vehicles exclusively for the company. &ldquo;Today, we have a team of over 150 people across India just to handle customer services and delivery,&rdquo; says Nilesh Gupta, Nanu&rsquo;s elder son and the company&rsquo;s managing director. All of which helped Vijay Sales hold its own when big retailers turned their eyes to electronics.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Thinking big</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Till well into the new millennium, Gupta was satisfied with Vijay Sales being a predominantly Mumbai- and Maharashtra-based business. But the entry of big players such as the Future Group with eZone, Reliance Digital and Tata with Croma made the company look to its laurels. &ldquo;We realised that if we did not expand our presence to keep up with competitors, we may be phased out. Until then, we were perhaps a little too relaxed,&rdquo; concedes Nilesh Gupta. Since FY09, Vijay Sales has expanded rapidly, moving into new geographies such as Delhi, the National Capital Region and Gujarat, opening 29 stores in the past five years (<em>see: Sound affair</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Sound affair- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The numbers for same-store sales aren&rsquo;t too impressive at present: new stores are clocking 15-20% y-o-y, while older stores are seeing flat growth. &ldquo;This reflects the stagnation in the consumer electronics retail business where, barring mobile phones, other products are seeing flat growth,&rdquo; says Nilesh Gupta. &ldquo;In the coming two years, as the economy revives and new categories are launched, we expect older stores to bounce back to the same growth rates as new ones,&rdquo; he adds. Given the current business environment, Vijay Sales is also going slow on further expansion &mdash; its first store in south India is planned for two years hence.</p>\n<p class="p3">Fifty-four stores in 46 years may not seem very impressive, but the careful thought before opening new stores has worked to Vijay Sales&rsquo; advantage &mdash; it has never closed down any store and its revenue share per store is higher than its rivals (<em>see: Efficiency matters</em>). &ldquo;We have been making 2-3% profits consistently and have offers and discounts all year long. Unlike our rivals, we leverage volumes, not the selling price,&rdquo; says Nilesh Gupta. Big brands that sell through the chain are not complaining either. &ldquo;We have grown with Vijay Sales and the one thing that makes us continue our relationship is their commitment. If Nanu Gupta says he will bring in X turnover every month, the target is set in stone. He ensures it is reached,&rdquo; says Sanjeev Agarwal, sales head, LG India. That thought is echoed by Venugopal Dhoot, chairman and MD, Videocon. &ldquo;Our relationship with Vijay Sales goes back 25 years. They know where to sell and what price to sell so the consumer sees value in the deal. That is an irresistible combination for companies such as ours,&rdquo; says Dhoot.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"They know where to sell and what price to sell so the consumer sees the value in the deal" - Venugopal Dhoot, chairman and MD, Videocon</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The Guptas certainly seem to have the magic touch when it comes to marketing consumer durables. Nilesh Gupta likes to recount an incident dating to when plasma TVs were new in India, around 2005. He was negotiating with an LG representative for the purchase of a few sets, when his father jumped into the conversation. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take 100 units of the Rs 3 lakh unit, if you can work out a way for us to sell it at #1,99,999,&rdquo; he said, even as Nilesh watched dumbstruck &mdash; other retailers weren&rsquo;t even stocking that model, claiming it would have no takers. But Nanu stuck to his guns, and was proved right &mdash; all 100 sets were sold within a month. &ldquo;We were also among the first to stock window air-conditioners, back in the 1980s, when even manufacturers wondered whether we had the expertise to sell them,&rdquo; Nilesh adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Efficiency matters- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In 2012, Vijay Sales decided to extend its expertise to the internet, reaching out to a new customer group through this route. The website is mainly popular with customers looking to buy mobile phones and Nilesh Gupta acknowledges that sales from this route are still a very minor part of the business, barely bringing in Rs 30-40 lakh a month. The number should increase substantially in the next couple of years, he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s where the recent tie-up with e-commerce site Snapdeal should help. Vijay Sales has a separate page on the Snapdeal site and pays a commission for all the deals that happen through the website. Gupta says the results have been encouraging, even though there are other players online selling the same brands at cheaper rates. &ldquo;Many of our online customers are settled abroad and buy products on our site as gifts for their parents and relatives. They aren&rsquo;t necessarily looking for the cheapest deal but want confidence in the product and the dealer,&rdquo; says Nilesh Gupta. Tony Navin, vice-president, business development, Snapdeal, agrees. &ldquo;The Vijay Sales brand has trust and recognition, which means increased customers for us. For the chain, our reach into tier 2 and 3 towns contributes to greater reach. The partnership is growing revenue at about 40-50% month-on-month.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Given the challenges it faces from large retail chains and the burgeoning popularity of e-retail in the electronics segment, Vijay Sales will have to bank on brand loyalty from such customers for sustained growth. Though its slow and studied pace and decision to retain control of its stores when it comes to expansion may keep Vijay Sales insulated from nasty financial shocks, it remains to be seen whether the friendly, neighbourhood electronics superstore will be able to keep pace with the vagaries of the segment.&nbsp;</p>', 'Can Vijay Sales hold its own with the onslaught of electronic retailers backed by big business groups?', '23', '', 0, '', 'taking-on-the-giants-183', 178, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Taking on the giants', 'Can Vijay Sales hold its own with the onslaught of electronic retailers backed by big business groups?', '', '', '', 'Vijay Sales,Videocon,LG India,Snapdeal', 0, NULL, '2015-01-21 13:41:16', '2015-01-21 14:57:00', '2014-03-01', 0),

With half its revenues coming from outside India, the company has a more balanced portfolio across categories and geographies.</p>\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;<span class="s1"><strong>Don&rsquo;t stop innovating</strong></span> &ldquo;We believe there is still tremendous headroom for growth in the Indian FMCG sector, given the relatively low penetration and consumption rates in many of the categories in which we participate,&rdquo; says Vivek Gambhir, managing director, GCPL. Therefore, it is important to balance dealing with the near-term vagaries with investing for the long-term. Over the past 18 months, GCPL has launched seven new products in India. These include air fresheners under the Godrej Aer brand; Godrej Expert Rich Cr&egrave;me, cr&egrave;me hair colour in a sachet priced at a market-disruptive #30; Hit anti-roach gel; and shower gels as part of the new Cinthol range. Last year, the market leader in household insecticides also introduced the Good Knight Fast Card, a paper-based mosquito repellent priced at #1 that claims to keep mosquitoes away for four hours. &ldquo;Our idea was to launch a product that would break the price barrier, work instantly and would not require electricity,&rdquo; explains Gambhir. Now, almost 40% of incremental growth is being driven by the new launches. &ldquo;Our focus on innovation has, in fact, accelerated and we have a very strong pipeline in place across categories for the next three years,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Improve the go-to market approach</strong></span> That means more than just adding outlets and villages, though GCPL did add 10,000 villages in the past 12 months, taking its total to nearly 50,000 villages across India.

Rural coverage through vans is on the increase, as are state-specific market actions. &ldquo;As a result of our efforts, our rural growth has been significantly outpacing our urban growth,&rdquo; says Gambhir.</p>\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;<span class="s1"><strong>Drive efficiencies </strong></span>GCPL has launched Project ICON (&lsquo;Improving CONtribution&rsquo;) that focuses on reducing costs in manufacturing, sourcing and logistics.

The company is targeting #100 crore in savings through these efforts in FY14.</p>\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;<span class="s1"><strong>Seek accretive acquisitions</strong></span> Instead of going slow on buyouts, GCPL has stepped up its efforts to find companies that are a strategic and operational fit. In January 2013, it bought UK-based women&rsquo;s deodorant brand Soft and Gentle and in October, picked up a 30% stake in B:blunt, a Mumbai-based hair salon chain. And in February 2014, GCPL acquired Lincoln Dental Supply from Keystone Industries and acquired the remaining 49% stake in Darling Group Holdings, the African hair care company it bought in 2011. &ldquo;We believe this is a good time to identify acquisitions that could improve our long-term competitive position,&rdquo; says Gambhir.</p>\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;<span class="s1"><strong>Optimise marketing investments</strong></span> GCPL has adopted an integrated marketing communication approach through which it focuses on one big idea for each brand and takes that idea across platforms &mdash; mass media advertising, online, trade engagements, point of purchase and public relations. For instance, towards end 2012, brand Cinthol was &ldquo;refreshed&rdquo; with a new tagline, &lsquo;Alive is awesome&rsquo;. The Alive bathing project engaged 85 travel and adventure bloggers for 45 days, where they shot videos of unique bathing experiences. The dedicated YouTube channel received 150,000 views, 300 people sent in their own bathing videos and the initiative clocked 750 blog write-ups with pictures. This was followed by a campaign for Cinthol deodorants with a new brand ambassador, Virat Kohli. The &lsquo;Intensely Alive&rsquo; initiative involved generating customised responses from Kohli for select consumers and was followed by the &lsquo;Challenge Virat&rsquo; campaign, where consumers met the cricketer and posed challenges such as hitting a six with a baseball bat and kicking a football from mid-on to the stumps, among others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;<span class="s1"><strong>Connect with consumers</strong></span> &ldquo;In uncertain times, it is important to communicate more to rally and motivate our troops and spend more time with our consumers,&rdquo; says Gambhir. Accordingly, GCPL has initiated an online engagement and collaboration platform called Yammer, where employees can share ideas and connect with each other. Gambhir himself spends half an hour every evening responding to all the posts on its Facebook equivalent.

(185, 16, '', 'A smart move', '<p class="p1">Quick, what is the link between Texas and California in the US, the Danish island of Bornholm and some 250 households in north Delhi? Give up? They are all areas that have installed smart meters and are part of a smart electricity grid initiative. The only difference (but it&rsquo;s a big one): Texas and California are the top-ranking&nbsp;American states in smart grid deployment, investment and customer engagement; at Bornholm, the technology is so advanced that an electric vehicle not only powers itself from the island&rsquo;s renewable energy sources such as the wind, its battery can also store excess renewable energy and feed the electricity back into the grid when needed. In stark contrast, at Tata Power Delhi Distribution (TPDDL), the project is getting off the ground. &ldquo;The move to smart grid is a path-breaking initiative for our company,&rdquo; says Praveer Sinha, CEO, TPDDL, which owns and operates distribution in north and northwest Delhi, an area with 1.3 million customers.</p>\n<p class="p3">What&rsquo;s significant, though, is that this is the first initiative in India in the private sector towards establishing a smart grid for power distribution. Even in the public sector, while several projects have been given the go-ahead (<em>see: The power to change</em>), little progress has been made on the ground. So, the TPDDL solution is going to generate more than just common interest. How does the company plan to transition to a smart grid? What challenges and opportunities lie ahead and how equipped is TPDDL to face these?</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Understanding the interest</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">First, though, just what is a smart grid? In a conventional system, the grid&rsquo;s role is mechanical. The consumer turns on the power switch, creating a demand for electricity that is met immediately by the supplier. In a smart grid, though, devices &lsquo;talk&rsquo; to the grid through the meter and usage can be timed for most efficient use of electricity, keeping in mind the demand on the grid and the available supply. There is communication between consumers and the power distributor, so they can track usage, know their billing in real time and manage consumption accordingly. Digital tools automate and run smart devices at every step of the grid, from the consumer end to the power plant. For the consumer, the benefits lie in lowered power bills (by taking advantage of off-peak hours to run appliances and machinery) and fewer or no outages (less peak load demand). For the power company, this is a way to optimise grid performance, introduce renewable energy sources into the grid and prevent outages (which means loss of revenue).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>The power to change- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The concept of smart grid, though, is an evolving one, as are the technologies it involves. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something like the six blind men and the elephant &mdash; each person has their own interpretation of smart grid,&rdquo; says RV Shahi, former power secretary, government of India. For example, for an IT person, a smart grid would mean how IT can be deployed to run a power grid. For someone with an interest in renewable energy, it would be about how to deploy more renewable energy; the interpretation would be still different for someone into demand-side management, and so on, he explains. &ldquo;The difference is that unlike the blind men, where each had a very different interpretation of the elephant, in the case of smart grids, everyone has at least some knowledge of the animal they are dealing with.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">TPDDL certainly has. &ldquo;It is essential to be consumer-centric, especially as we move away from a monopoly to a multiple supplier model, as is being envisaged through amendments to the Electricity Act,&rdquo; explains Sinha. &ldquo;Also, unlike in other products where if you sell more, you make more, in the distribution business, consumption comes down at the higher levels because of the differential tariff rates. In such a situation, it is important to have a mechanism to ensure customers consume more when rates are low and restrict peak demand of electricity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s not the only advantage.&nbsp; The potential savings with a smart grid are immense, points out Sinha. &ldquo;We spend 50% of our time attending to localised complaints that can be as simple as a tripping of the circuit board in a house. With smart grids, we can pinpoint the fault and rectify it quickly, saving time and manpower costs,&rdquo; Sinha says. In 2002, when TPDDL came into existence through a joint venture with the Delhi government, it had a headcount of 5,600. That has been reduced over the years to the current 3,600. Going forward, the plan is to reduce employee strength by 100 people every year, which is where automation and the smart grid will come in. Over the next five years, the company plans capex of Rs 1,000 crore to move towards a smart grid-based model.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Power on</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">TPDDL&rsquo;s interest in smart grids isn&rsquo;t new. It first expressed an interest in moving to a smart grid more than four years ago, when it won approval from the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) for a pilot implementing an automated demand response (ADR) system that rationalises power supply to high-use consumers. The Rs 12.5-crore pilot has been implemented and involves putting in place at the distributor-end technologies such as automated meter reading (AMR), geographical information systems and outage management systems (OMS).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The first step to a smart grid, though, is to ensure every power customer in the area is accounted for. TPDDL achieved 100% metering in its circle in 2008 &mdash; an achievement in itself, considering in other parts of the country, close to 30% of energy consumption still remains unaccounted for as there is no metering.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The second phase of the smart grid project was launched in October 2013, when TPDDL announced it had selected IBM to support it in creating system architecture and adhering to international smart grid standards. While there is no commercial agreement with IBM, the US tech major will help TPDDL in integrating advanced metering and ADR systems with the grid&rsquo;s existing applications. &ldquo;Our global experience in smart grids should help TPDDL in its initiative. IBM, too, will benefit from this India experience,&rdquo; says Rahul Sharma, executive director and partner, global business services, IBM India &amp; South Asia. IBM aside, TPDDL is also partnering with other technology majors such as GE and Siemens for the smart grid project.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In January 2014, DERC gave TPDDL its nod for the next pilot project &mdash; an end-to-end solution combining ADR with smart meters and AMI (advanced metering infrastructure). &ldquo;The pilot scheme we launched is being done on a nominal cost basis. What would have cost Rs 20 crore is being done for Rs 5 crore as even some vendors are supplying equipment on nominal basis, not commercial rates,&rdquo; adds Sinha. &ldquo;Needless to say, as we scale up the model, the costs will go up.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">The project includes around 250 industrial and commercial consumers with load greater than 100 KW and a collective shed potential of 20 MW. The consumers are spread over a 100 sq km area, covering industrial and institutional belts such as Lawrence Road, Narela, Civil Lines, Naraina and Pitampura, and involves 100 11 KV feeders fed from 40 grid stations. How will it work? Thanks to smart meters, there will be two-way communication between the consumer and the utility, which will enable peak load shaving &mdash; reducing power consumption during periods of maximum demand by redistributing loads to different period of the day. With this, there is also substantial saving on peaking charges. A dedicated customer portal will allow consumers to set threshold values for load and power factor; they will receive alerts either through the portal or via SMS if these thresholds are breached. The smart meters will also provide instant information on outages, helping the company manage peak power demand and avoid buying expensive power to tide over shortages.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Scaling up [smart grids] can result in tremendous savings on creating additional infra for the utility company" - Rahul Sharma, ED, IBM India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In the next phase, the project will be extended to another 800 high-use consumers, which will add another potential 20 MW. &ldquo;Scaling this up can result in tremendous savings on creating additional infrastructure for the utility company,&rdquo; says Sharma. Here&rsquo;s how that could happen. If peak demand rises from the current, say, 10,000 MW to 12,000 MW, power companies have to prepare to meet this additional demand. Setting up 2,000 MW of power plants can cost anywhere up to Rs 10,000 crore. But with a smart grid and peak shaving techniques that make customers shift their power requirements; this demand can be restricted to much lower than 2,000 MW.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Tripping points</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The TPDDL plan sounds great on paper, but there are several challenges in setting up a smart grid. While the company has overcome one of the biggest hurdles &mdash; achieving 100% metering, which reduces leakages in the system &mdash; it, like any other distributor planning a smart grid, has had to overcome the next hurdle of laying fresh optic fibre cable networks (separate from those laid by telecom companies) to ensure zero possibility of breakdowns. That means the additional burden of getting permission to lay cables (especially when the city was gearing up for the Commonwealth Games four years ago) as well as the additional expense involved.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Remember, any capex made and approved by the regulator is recovered from retail tariffs, and consumers may baulk at paying extra for a smart grid &mdash; as it is, they have to bear the expense of installing the smart meter, which may cost up to four times as much as a normal meter. Sinha points out that in Tokyo, the plan is to shift 27 million customers to smart grids in three years. &ldquo;We plan to shift just 300,000 high-end customers (consuming 600 units and more every month) in three years. And high-end consumers in India pay just 10 cents a unit, unlike Tokyo&rsquo;s 30 cents. But motivating cost-conscious consumers is a huge challenge,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">How is TPDDL persuading customers to make the switch? Sinha says the key lies in demonstrating the commercial benefits of the transition and shifting non-essential electrical loads to off-peak times. For instance, in hospitals, the company&rsquo;s marketing team suggested running just one lift instead of three during peak demand time, while ensuring essential services such as operation theatres and oxygen supply ran uninterrupted. Then, at the Britannia factory on Lawrence Road, TPDDL suggested baking &mdash; a critical part of the business &mdash; be shifted to off-peak time. The idea is to reduce peak demand at the factory by 10% from the present 10 MW &mdash; a saving of 1 MW.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Peak shaving is only one element of the smart grid applications TPDDL is planning. Going forward, the company will also tap renewable energy sources to meet consumer demand during peak time. For this, starting 2015, TPDDL plans to encourage buildings and housing societies to install solar panels on rooftops. The electricity generated from these will be used not only for the consumers who installed the panels, but will also feed into the entire north Delhi grid, thus making the panels pay for themselves. Of course, the proposal will have to be approved by the regulator before it can be initiated. While the jury is still out on how the solar plans pan out, Shahi, for his part, has a different take on some of the initiatives being talked about in the country. &ldquo;Many new ideas are being proposed to meet demand. Now there is talk of even telecom towers being run on solar power. The question is, how many of these ideas are really feasible?&rdquo; he asks. For his part, Sinha is quietly confident about the company&rsquo;s plans. &ldquo;There is no other way solar panels can be a viable investment unless they are integrated into the grid,&rdquo; he points out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Many new ideas are being proposed to meet demand, but how many of them are really feasible?" RV Shahi, former power secretary</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Smart grids have proven their efficacy at Bornholm, Texas and California, but the idea is in its infancy in India.

(187, 20, '', 'In search of velocity', '<p class="p1">When Polali Jayarama Bhat secured a first rank in MSc (chemistry) from Mysore University in 1972, he never imagined that he would end up a career banker. But as fate would have it, after dabbling for three months as a lecturer in a government college, Bhat got a break in Karnataka Bank as a probationary officer in 1973. And it seems the chemistry has since worked well for the 62-year-old, who after spending close to four decades is today at the helm of the bank, overseeing assets around #66,000 crore. Incidentally, Karnataka Bank, which went public in 1995, has the unique distinction of being the only listed private sector bank from the South Kanara region &mdash; the rest have either been nationalised or merged. Interestingly, Karnataka Bank itself has a history of M&amp;A, taking over three regional banks in the 1960s. Today, after 90 years of its existence, the bank boasts of 561 branches, a lending book over Rs 27,000 crore and deposits of close to Rs 39,000 crore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">However, over the past decade or so while the bank&rsquo;s net profit has grown at 8%, the absence of a dominant shareholder and its strong regional presence have occasionally kept rumour mills active about the bank either being merged or acquired. Can the bank then hold on to its independent legacy? The question is particularly pertinent given that for a whole host of conglomerates and non-banks eagerly waiting to grab new bank licences, strong regional players such as Karnataka Bank make for a suitable match. For Bhat, though, selling out is clearly not an option. &ldquo;I have said in various forums that we are not a bank to be acquired. We are resisting anybody&rsquo;s efforts to acquire our bank and it is not possible also as the shares are widely held,&rdquo; says Bhat stoically, sitting out of the bank&rsquo;s soberly decorated regional HQ in Mumbai.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Sticky money- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">But as it turns out, in the case of Karnataka Bank, things may be coming to a point where a potential merger may simply become inevitable. If and when that comes through, it will be a welcome change for investors who have got nothing out of the bank except stable dividends. Over the past 10 years, the bank&rsquo;s share price has remained stagnant. While the bank has given an average dividend of 38% over the past 10 years, its current yield amounts to 4%. The past decade might have been miserable for investors but lets delve into why Karnataka Bank really matters.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Perfect match</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Bereft of funding from the government which nationalised banks had access to, Karnataka Bank has largely been a regional bank. Of its 561 branches, 434 are in the south with 346 in Karnataka alone. Even with respect to future branch expansion, Bhat is clear that 50% out of the total branches proposed to be opened will be in the Karnataka state to capitalise on its strong brand equity. The local nature of its business has ensured strong goodwill not only among borrowers but depositors as well. UR Bhat, founder, Dalton Capital Advisors and until recently, director on the board of the bank, says, &ldquo;The bank competes with public sector banks such as Canara, Syndicate, Corporation, Vijaya and State Bank of Mysore. One would expect a private bank like them to pay a higher interest rate to garner deposits but their goodwill ensures they can do so &mdash; in quite a few maturity buckets &mdash; by paying the same or even lower interest rates.&rdquo; Even more, 98% of Karnataka Bank&rsquo;s funds come from retail deposits signifying almost zero reliance on wholesale deposits (<em>see: Sticky money</em>). That stickiness in deposits gives the bank enormous opportunity to monetise its liability (deposit) franchise, but there is a challenge, too, says Sweta Sheth, analyst, Stewart &amp; Mackertich Wealth Management, &ldquo;Bigger old generation private banks such as Karur Vysya and ING Vysya pose significant competition.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Changing gears</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The management isn&rsquo;t unaware of the challenges. That&rsquo;s why the bank embarked on re-engineering its business processes to accelerate growth. Along with targeting aggressive growth in low-cost deposits or CASA (current account saving accounts), it is also relying on its wide network of ATMs to act as a profit centre. Every November to February, it runs an increase CASA campaign. Last year it added 500,000 new accounts and has garnered another 400,000 this year. Bhat says, &ldquo;Our aim is to increase CASA from 24.7% to 26% by end-FY14 and achieve around 30-35% over the next five years.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The management is also banking on increasing debit card penetration to cut costs. Currently, its debit card penetration is 40% and an ATM uptime of 99.5% not only ensures high footfalls from its customers but a sizeable number of acquired transactions as well. Bhat understands branch transactions are costly. It works to about #40-45 per transaction compared with #15 for an ATM transaction, he acknowledges. &ldquo;We are opening many off-site ATMs so the services of our staff can also be deployed for other productive business,&rdquo; he adds. From the current 612 ATMs, Bhat wants to take the number to 700 by March 2014.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Led by this aggressive retail push, the bank is aiming to increase its mix of retail assets from the current 51% to 60%. Sheth expects this to boost the bank&rsquo;s return ratios, which have seen a downward trend, of late. RoE has fallen from 13.67% in the quarter ended December 2012 to 10.36% in the latest quarter ending December 2013 and RoA has dipped from 0.97% to 0.71% over the same period. &ldquo;Many bankers are very cautious in the current environment. They prefer maintaining asset quality rather than aggressively growing the loan book. If the book doesn&rsquo;t grow and the profits are eaten away by provisioning, RoE and RoA are definitely going to be hit,&rdquo; mentions Sheth.</p>\n<p class="p3">The question is can the bank really lend profitably in an environment where other banks are playing it safe? Nishid Shah, president, Ambika Fincap and a long-time investor in Karnataka Bank thinks so. &ldquo;HDFC Bank and Axis Bank have been growing around 27-30% year-on-year. So there is no reason why Karnataka Bank can&rsquo;t to do it. Their total size is Rs 66,000 crore, advances and deposits put together and in three years they should cross Rs 120,000 crore.&rdquo; That might come through but for now there is a more pressing problem at hand, that of deteriorating asset quality.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Book problem</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Currently, the bank has gross NPAs of 3.65% and net NPA of 2.23%. &ldquo;We want gross NPAs below 3% and net NPAs below 2%. Once we achieve that, provision will get released which will increase the net profit,&rdquo; points out Bhat. That could work out in a best-case scenario and if it does not, the bank simply can&rsquo;t wish away its bad loans. And for a bank of its size, its net non-performing loans form a sizeable part of its tier-1 capital of Rs 2,819 crore (<em>see: Worry wart</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Worry wart- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">While the bank has been meeting its operating profit projections, provisions and contingencies have eaten into FY14 profits. Even for the final quarter of FY14, the management has guided that restructured loans will be to the tune of Rs 200 crore. While Bhat mentioned in the investor conference call that net restructured loans in the last quarter could be around Rs 100 crore owing to recovery in some previous bad loans, investors are clearly taking a wait and watch approach. &ldquo;At the beginning of FY14, management had a gross NPA target of 2.5% and net NPA of below 1%. Seeing the current situation I doubt if they would be able to reach that target,&rdquo; opines Sheth.</p>\n<p class="p3">No wonder, the bank continues to trade at a discount. For FY14, the book value will be closer to Rs 172, while the stock currently trades at Rs 95. The management itself has made some cardinal mistakes in the past that has eroded value. Historically, the bank has raised capital through rights issues below book value. Shah adds that people who argue that right shares at a discount is not dilutive as it is given to all the shareholders miss a major point that all the shareholders may not have cash to subscribe to the rights shares. &ldquo;A good bank will try and ensure that equity dilution enhances the book value by issuing shares at a premium; at HDFC, Axis and ICICI &mdash; almost all equity dilution has enhanced book value. In case of Karnataka Bank, it has been book value dilutive.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Nudge to merge</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The time of reckoning may be near. Existing investors are an unhappy lot, the NPA problem persists despite management efforts to rein in non-performing loans, and the prevailing economic environment as well as the competitive landscape is only leading to a situation where the bank will find it extremely difficult to raise capital.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While the going may get tough for Karnataka Bank, it may turn out to be a plum picking for a potential suitor. It&rsquo;s not just its strong regional presence and sticky deposits that make it a perfect match for someone wanting to grow their presence in the south &mdash; the bank also has substantial monetisable assets &mdash; it owns most of its regional office premises, it also has many company flats for its officers in Bengaluru and Mumbai. In India&rsquo;s financial capital alone, it has more than 100 flats.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Trigger happy - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The real question is will the management relent. It seems unlikely, for now. &ldquo;Our bank will continue to be run by a professional board as it has been for many years now,&rdquo; mentions Bhat, further adding that it will be difficult for anyone to acquire control &ldquo;because of a large number of shareholders holding less than 1,000 shares.&rdquo; He mentions that foreign investors are holding their stakes for investment purpose and are interested in seeing the market price move closer to or cross the book value.</p>\n<p class="p3">For a bank that has seen its share price languish below book value for many years, that cross-over could materialise with an ownership change. Institutional investors, who are holding a 25% stake, may really not care what triggers that change. Usually, they are quick to tender shares when they see quick money on the table. Although it&rsquo;s not a big deal for a deep-pocketed acquirer to line-up about Rs 1,000 crore &mdash; that&rsquo;s the theoretical price tag for a 50% stake at the current market price &mdash; a potential suitor may simply not take that route. Often, a hostile bid triggers a run in the stock price that ends up hurting the buyer. More importantly, an outright buyout also comes with the additional complication of an eventual reduction in the promoter&rsquo;s stake to less than 10% in line with the central bank diktat. UR Bhat feels if the potential acquirer is a bank or a NBFC controlled by a promoter it is very unlikely that RBI will allow it to happen as it is against its avowed objective. &ldquo;However, if the potential acquirer is a widely held company or bank with no identifiable promoter, it is possible that the RBI may consider. Then, there also has to be enough willingness on the part of the Karnataka Bank management and shareholders to go ahead.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Whichever way, with a less than 1 % stake that the management commands, and the little goodwill that the bank may have with its investors for its diligent dividend pay-outs, the management may hardly wield the power to resist a potential merger if the situation arises. Currently, the stock trades at Rs 95, down 63% from its all-time high of Rs 259 reached in the January 2008 frenzy. A new buyer could well help unlock the value embedded in the bank. But, what if this really does not work out?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s quite possible that the bank&rsquo;s efforts to grow organically and reduce bad assets may yield results, but that is not the only thing you can count on as an investor. The trigger to buy the stock is the fact that the stock trades even at a discount to adjusted book value &mdash; with a very good chance of a friendly merger unlocking value &mdash; and has a minimal downside even if status-quo is maintained.&nbsp;</p>', 'Karnataka Bank is trying to accelerate organic growth but can it avoid being taken over?', '2', '', 0, '', 'in-search-of-velocity-187', 182, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'In search of velocity', 'Karnataka Bank is trying to accelerate organic growth but can it avoid being taken over?', '', '', '', 'Karnataka Bank,Jayarama Bhat,Sticky deposits,NPAs', 0, NULL, '2015-01-21 16:10:34', '2015-01-21 16:37:40', '2014-03-01', 0),

The Necklace Road down Hussain Sagar lake, however, is a refreshing exception &mdash; well-paved and picturesque, with scant traffic in the mornings. This makes the stretch perfect for early morning joggers, cyclists and, well, Vuppala. Because on any given weekend morning, the 37-year-old co-founder and CEO of Nephroplus, a kidney care network provider, straps on his armour of elbow and knee pads and takes to the streets on his rollerblades. Cars often slow down to take in the sight, children run along trying to keep up and grown-ups whip out their camera phones and start snapping. Needless to say, rollerblading isn&rsquo;t a very popular activity in India, <em>yet</em>. Even Vuppala&rsquo;s stint with the sport began when he was pursuing his Masters in Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Chicago. &ldquo;At the university, no one used motorised vehicles to commute from one place to the other. Rollerblading, cycling or walking were faster and more cost-efficient. My dorm was about two miles from the college building, but I never used a vehicle to travel back and forth,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">An engineer from IIT Kharagpur, Vuppala moved to the US in 2000 for his Masters in computer science and later pursued MBA from the University of Chicago. &ldquo;I taught myself how to skate, at first, but friends suggested that I take professional coaching to get my stance and posture right and minimise damage to my limbs.&rdquo; After a series of sessions with a trainer and &ldquo;half a million&rdquo; falls, rollerblading became second nature for Vuppala.</p>\n<p class="p3">But the move back home has cut down his rollerblading hours drastically. &ldquo;I miss all the time I used to spend rollerblading. Like any other entrepreneur, I am perennially short of free time. I do manage to catch up on it during the weekends.&rdquo; But the high that the sport gives can be difficult to keep away from, even on vacation. Vuppala recounts instances when he rented rollerblades on trips abroad to satisfy his craving. The fact that roads tend to be paved and smoother abroad is an added advantage. &ldquo;Though shops renting out rollerblades aren&rsquo;t very common, a lot of places in France, which I frequent, do offer these services,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">Vuppala, who has worked with McKinsey and Abbott Laboratories in New York in the past, says that the experience of setting up his own enterprise back home after spending more than a decade working abroad has changed his life in more ways than one. And while local conditions have forced him to cut back on rollerblading, he has supplemented his fitness regime by taking to running. Inspired by his wife&rsquo;s decision to run a half marathon, Vuppala started training for the same himself and has since completed four half marathons. &ldquo;As young entrepreneurs, we are neither bogged down by a fixed routine nor are we afraid of challenges. So, we tend to focus on our fitness and keep testing our limits,&rdquo; he says.

The brand has been operating through pop-ups, design events and social media so far, with e-retail and international shipping to begin by February. With monthly sales of about Rs&nbsp;2 lakh, Arjun contends it will take two or three years for the brand to break even. But with plans to stock an expanded product range at retail outlets, Kulture Shop is on course to spread the love of art.&nbsp;</p>', 'Just Started', '12', '', 0, '', 'stretching-the-canvas-192', 187, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Stretching the canvas', 'Just Started', '', '', '', 'Kulture Shop,Graphic designers', 0, NULL, '2015-01-21 17:41:52', '2015-01-21 17:43:34', '2014-02-01', 0),
(193, 12, '', 'The Sith Lord of startups', '<p class="p1">California-based 500 Startups isn&rsquo;t your regular accelerator and its founder and &lsquo;Sith Lord&rsquo;, Dave McClure, isn&rsquo;t your regular VC. You either love him or hate him but you can&rsquo;t ignore him. A veteran of PayPal, Founders Fund, Facebook and LinkedIn, among others, he has invested in over 250 companies, including Mint.com, Twilio, Wildfire, SendGrid, SlideShare and MakerBot &nbsp;in the 20 years he has spent in Silicon Valley. In 2010, he started 500 Startups, a seedfund and accelerator, right under the shadow of the most successful accelerator to come out of the Valley, the Y Combinator. &ldquo;A lot of people thought we were f*****g crazy to compete with [Y Combinator] in their own backyard. But we knew we were going to be different,&rdquo; says McClure, on a recent visit to India as keynote speaker at the Asian Business Angel Forum 2013 organised by the Mumbai Angels.</p>\n<p class="p3">The difference? 500 Startups would find not just the black swans but also groom the ugly ducklings.&nbsp;With $80 million under management, the fund has a team of 30 of which 10 members make the investments. Over the past four years, it has invested in more than 600 businesses across 45 countries, of which 400 are still up and running. McClure believes around 100-200 of those investments will be of some consequence some day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The fund runs its accelerator programme out of Mountain View, California, with two batches of 30-odd companies graduating every year. A second accelerator programme will be launched in a couple of weeks from a new office in San Francisco. So, on average, 500 Startups will have 120 companies coming out of its accelerator programmes every year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">At the accelerator stage, the fund makes an investment of up to $50,000 for about 5% stake. At the seed stage, investments are up to $250,000. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t like to fund more than 20-30% of the investment round and our first-round cheques are typically never more than $100,000,&rdquo; says Pankaj Jain, venture partner at 500 Startups and head of its India operations. &ldquo;It is important to not over-invest early on in a startup. Early-stage investments are high-risk and it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to go all in at once. Successful angel investors in the Valley have typically made small but early investments and a number of small investments.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">500 Startups has a similar message for entrepreneurs as well. &ldquo;We believe that until they are able to prove the product-market fit, entrepreneurs should be willing to take smaller amounts of money and give up little of their company rather than taking huge amounts of money and giving up 20-30% of their company,&rdquo; says Jain. This way, entrepreneurs can raise more money at higher valuations and investors would also be willing to pay a higher valuation since the risk is lower after the product-market fit is established.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The fund has made over 150 investments outside the US: in Asia, Latin America and Europe. In November 2012, 500 Startups drew up plans to raise a $5 million fund called 500 Startup Wallah to invest in Indian startups. While it is yet to announce its formal closure, 500 Startups continues to actively invest in India.</p>\n<p class="p3">Mukund Mohan, director, Microsoft Ventures, and his wife Vinita Ananth are investors in 500 Startups. &ldquo;I have known Dave for over 10 years now and his approach is very disruptive. When I looked at the startup funding landscape in India, I realised we need someone with his tenacity and his aggressive approach to funding good entrepreneurs quickly was the right approach,&rdquo; says Mohan.</p>\n<p class="p3">In India, the fund has already invested in nearly 18 diverse startups such as Pricebaba, WalletKit, TradeBriefs, Squarekey, Instamojo, Tushky, MyGola and CucumberTown. It has also put in money in 12 companies along with GSF Accelerator, with whom 500 Startups has a tie-up.</p>\n<p class="p3">But McClure doesn&rsquo;t seem too impressed with the investing environment in India. He believes Indian VCs are not taking enough risks and not backing many companies, citing the lack of ideas. &ldquo;Ideas are not awesome, execution is awesome. There will be always some companies that won&rsquo;t go on to raise chunks of money, but that is okay. We, as investors, need to write more cheques. Investors in India are less confident about their entrepreneurs and you need to kick their butts,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">But then, McClure also believes VCs themselves haven&rsquo;t scaled and reinvested in their own business even as they lecture their portfolio companies on the same issues.&nbsp; &ldquo;VCs have been lazy b******s taking fat paycheques from lazy LPs who haven&rsquo;t challenged them to be more innovative. We have been terrible investors, with more than half the VCs not even returning capital, yet we think we are golden gods,&rdquo; he said in his keynote address. His idea: given that companies can be built for less, thanks to innovation in technology, investors should be making more smaller bets and looking for reasonable exits rather than making just a few bets and looking for big bang exits. 500 Startups&rsquo; own track record: it has had over 25 exits so far with three in the over-$100 million bracket. &ldquo;I would be happier if I had one in five $25 million exits rather one in 10-20 $100 million exits. Large exits are mostly the entrepreneurs&rsquo; doing, not the investors&rsquo;.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">And this is perhaps the best time to start a business, he recommends. Startup costs are low; it is easier to acquire customers, thanks to different online platforms; and there is better access to capital. &ldquo;Thanks to these factors, a number of smart people are starting companies and investors have a lot to choose from. And that is wonderful for both investors and consumers. Some of them will fail, but we will be fools on a smaller budget,&rdquo; he laughs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Whether his peers buy into this argument or not, McClure isn&rsquo;t slowing down anytime soon. He remains bullish on the non-English speaking markets, which he believes will become huge markets over the next five to 10 years as more consumers go online.&nbsp;Not wanting to miss out on that, he&rsquo;s probably on a flight right now looking for the next geek to fund.&nbsp;</p>', 'Why VC Dave McClure thinks the Indian investor community should be writing more cheques', '6', '', 0, '', 'the-sith-lord-of-startups-193', 188, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'The Sith Lord of startups', 'Why VC Dave McClure thinks the Indian investor community should be writing more cheques', '', '', '', 'Dave McClure,500 Startups,Entrepreneurs,Angel investors,Microsoft Ventures', 0, NULL, '2015-01-21 17:45:42', '2015-01-21 18:00:47', '2014-02-01', 0),
(194, 12, '', 'The fine print', '<p class="p1">Kottayam and Ahmedabad seem unlikely places to set off India&rsquo;s e-book evolution. Yet they were. In 2010, Ahmedabad-headquartered online retailer Infibeam was first off the block with its Pi e-book reader. Soon after, Kottayam, Kerala-based publisher DC Books introduced the Wink e-reader. Both were just a little bit ahead of their time. By mid-2011, Wink had been pulled off the market as tablets and smartphones began to pour into India. The Pi continues to list on the Infibeam website as a &lsquo;sold out&rsquo; product.</p>\n<p class="p3">But these two homegrown businesses were forerunners to an e-books frenzy that now has top global e-reader brands, publishers and online retailers lining up big plans for India. The country is considered one of the top 10 markets for books and the third largest market for English books. E-books are tapping into this market, aided by an expanding youth demographic. And everything from pulp fiction to serious literature, non-fiction and even comic books, is turning digital. But how big is the opportunity, really?</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;The Indian e-book market is less than 1% of the overall books market by value,&rdquo; says Ananth Padmanabhan, vice-president, sales, Penguin India, and vice-president of the Association of Publishers in India, an industry body. Estimates for the print publishing market peg it at Rs 10,000 crore, but reliable figures are hard to come by. This has to do primarily with the fragmented reporting of sales by India&rsquo;s publishing houses, dominated by small and mid-size businesses. There are global pointers, though, that e-books are well on their way to change how books are read and experienced. In early 2011, Amazon&rsquo;s worldwide e-book sales surpassed its physical book sales for the first time, and continue to be among its fastest growing categories, even as its print books sales shows sluggish growth. At Penguin Random House, e-books contribute a third of total book sales in the US and 21% of global book revenues, both numbers up a couple of percentage points from 2012. And in its results for the quarter ended September 2013, HarperCollins reported that sales from its 30,000-odd e-book titles accounted for 22% of publishing revenues, up 30% y-o-y. Similarly, says Padmanabhan, &ldquo;Publishers in a growing market such as India will definitely see a 3X-5X growth y-o-y in e-book sales for at least the next three to five years.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Between the lines</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">&ldquo;E-books in India are at a very early stage,&rdquo; concedes Vinutha Mallya, founder of Linespace, a Bengaluru-based publishing advisory and consulting firm. But while they have arrived in a big way in India nearly a decade after the West, the ecosystem here is getting created faster. &ldquo;We have more or less leapfrogged the e-book evolution in terms of devices,&rdquo; says Haja Sheriff, country director, India, for Canada&rsquo;s Kobo, the latest entrant into the e-book and e-reader business in India. So instead of the e-reader first and the tablet and smartphone later, India&rsquo;s digital reading opportunity cuts across these devices, and operating systems all at once.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We have leapfrogged the e-book evolution in the country in terms of devices" - Haja Sheriff, country head, India, Kobo</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Leading the charge is Flipkart, which launched e-books in November 2012 across major mobile platforms, Android, Windows and iOS. &ldquo;We have rights for half a million titles,&rdquo; says Anil Goteti, director, retail, Flipkart. Already the largest seller of books in India, Flipkart has ambitions to do the same with e-books. Goteti observes: &ldquo;Easier access to technology and content is making e-books popular. Over 90% of people who buy an e-book read it.&rdquo; Moreover, from bookmarks to social media sharing and reading across multiple devices, e-books offer a far more interactive reading experience that appeals to a younger generation of readers. Much of the initial traction in e-books has come from free offerings, and that&rsquo;s hardly surprising, given the &lsquo;everything&rsquo;s free on the internet&rsquo; mindset that is associated with written content. Flipkart has over 10,000 free titles, and has priced many of its e-books at under Rs 99 to induce first-time buyers. It has also partnered with Sony and Nokia to have its e-book app pre-burned on some of their mobile handset models.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Easier access to technology and content is making e-books popular. Over 90% of people who buy an e-book read it" - Anil Goteti, director, retail, Flipkart</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Makers of e-book readers such as Amazon and Kobo point to the benefits of reading on a dedicated device &mdash; the e-ink that gives a real printed word feel, massive battery life of one to two months and the fact that they are less distracting than multi-function devices such as tablets and smartphones. Amazon&rsquo;s iconic Kindle e-book reader, which launched last year in India, comes with a library of around 2 million e-books, and over 325,000 titles exclusive to its Kindle Store, according to a company spokesperson. Of these, over 600,000 e-books are priced at #200 or less. Kobo, now owned by Tokyo-based Rakuten, claims to have 16 million registered users across 190 countries, and a library of nearly 4 million titles, including more than 1 million free books.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Kobo&rsquo;s distribution strategy has centred on the bookstore, the very business e-books threaten to diminish. It launched a few months ago and now has over 100 retail outlets, including Crossword, Croma and WHSmith across 14 cities. Kindle e-readers are available both online and offline in over 200 outlets. But e-readers might not be the key to e-book consumption in the third largest smartphone market in the world after the US and China. IDC reports that smartphone shipments by vendors to India nearly quadrupled to 12.8 million units in the third quarter of 2013 on a y-o-y basis, with large screen phablets (5 inch &ndash; 6.99 inch screen size) growing to contribute 23% to the overall market in volume terms during this period. It&rsquo;s hardly a mystery, then, where most Indians will be doing their digital reading.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Paper v/s tech</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The books industry is divided into two categories &mdash; trade books, which comprise the popular genres of fiction and non-fiction, and educational and academic books. Much of the action so far has been on educational books that came in from outside, says Linespace&rsquo;s Mallya: &ldquo;These were early adopters of e-books, and they got distributed through the library network.&rdquo; The current buzz around e-books began with popular categories even as some, such as coffee table books and box-sets, continue to be print-led. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Much of the action in the e-books space so far has been on educational books" Vinutha Mallya, founder, Linespace</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Hachette was the first to launch its e-book titles in India last year. Penguin India started with 250 titles as e-books in July 2012, converting past titles or backlists, and also simultaneously introducing new titles, both in print and as e-books. Of Penguin India&rsquo;s 2,000-odd titles, half are now available as e-books. While Penguin, among others, publishes both print and e-books at the same price, the end price of a book in India, whether physical or electronic, is determined by retailers. Already, trade margins, known as discounts to trade on the cover price of a book, are up, from 40% five years ago, to more than 50% currently. The retailer could then further discount it by up to 10%. Discounts to retailers on e-books are even higher, and they further discount the books to customers even more, making losses on e-books higher than that on print.</p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s3">So, can e-books be more economical to produce and more profitable for publishers? According to industry sources, an e-book version is typically 15-20% cheaper to produce than the paperback title. And unlike a printed book, which has a production and warehousing cost each time its printed and distributed, producing an e-book is a one-time affair with minimal storage and distribution costs. &ldquo;There are other costs &mdash; costs of technology, costs of storing an e-book, DRM [digital rights management] etc,&rdquo; says Padmanabhan. &ldquo;Yet they are more profitable in the long run.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p class="p3">Indeed, publishers are also only too happy to grow their market beyond physical boundaries of each country. &ldquo;Physical books are typically sold within a region while e-books can go on sale around the world instantly. They are about convenience. You publish once, and sell many times,&rdquo; says Padmanabhan. There is also the problem of rising costs in the print publishing business. &ldquo;Physical production and distribution costs have been increasing 15-18% every year on account of raw material cost increases, VAT and other taxes and distributor margins. But book prices have stayed flat for the past three to five years. We could manage because of economies of scale,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"E-books are about convenience. You publish once and sell many times" - Ananth Padmanabhan, vice-president, sales, Penguin India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Then, marketing expenses on promoting e-books tend to be high, but the reach is exponential. &ldquo;If I run one promotion with Flipkart, I have the ability to reach a customer base of 5 million. I could never reach so many people unless I carried a full page ad in <em>The</em> <em>Times of India</em>,&rdquo; says a senior publishing executive, who did not wish to be named. He adds that five years ago, even large publishing houses barely spent on digital. &ldquo;Today it&rsquo;s 20-30% of the marketing spends of even small publishers,&rdquo; he adds. Such spends are justified, as the conversion rates are said to be at least 12-15% (usually much higher) in case of e-books, compared with 2-5% for a physical book. Why? E-books are promptly downloadable, the transaction is quick, and money gets credited instantly to the seller and publisher.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>Future tense</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">While e-books are growing at about 12-15% annually, and could well overtake their physical counterpart, for now printed books continue to sell the most. &ldquo;There remains a significant demand for print in India and it&rsquo;s growing,&rdquo; points out Mallya, who sees e-books picking up over the next three to five years. Some e-book sellers have tried bundling of print and e-books but this hasn&rsquo;t worked, simply because readers prefer either one of the formats: &ldquo;They are different audiences.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Publishers and e-book sellers, meanwhile, are addressing the digital space through innovative offerings. Among them is a new category known as e-singles. Essentially, these are stories or chapters from a full-length book in fiction or non-fiction, or a collection of plays or poetry that a reader can buy separately, instead of the entire book, and consume in a shorter time. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like buying an audio single,&rdquo; says Padmanabhan. The idea is to provide choice and the option to pay as per need, he adds. Typically between 3,000 and 5,000 words, Padmanabhan says Penguin&rsquo;s 120 e-singles released so far, in the fiction and non-fiction genres, are priced at Rs 25-99 each.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Self-publishing offers another opportunity for e-book sellers by creating a new breed of authors and readers. The revenue model here is different, with authors setting their own price. Smashwords, the world&rsquo;s largest distributor of self-published e-books, for instance, works on the agency model, making money entirely on the commissions from e-book sales. Smashwords is a self-serve platform, which means the author or publisher is entirely responsible for writing and editing the book as well as creating the e-book cover. Smashword&rsquo;s technology converts the manuscript into multiple formats so the book can be read on any e-reading device. Under the revenue share model, says Mark Coker, founder, Smashwords, the retailer earns 30% of the listed price on every sale, Smashwords earns 10% while the author gets the rest. It entered into a distribution agreement with Flipkart in August 2013 for supplying from its catalogue of over 200,000 e-book titles sourced from over 80,000 authors and small independent publishers across the world.</p>\n<p class="p3">Clearly, in what promises to be among the largest e-book markets worldwide, the battle lines have been drawn. While Penguin&rsquo;s Padmanabhan hopes to take e-book sales to 10-15% of total book sales for his company in three years, others too are bringing global networks and experience to bear on their India plans. Kobo is targeting to sell almost 250,000 of its e-readers by December 2014, Sheriff points out. With relationships with more than 11,000 publishers and about 1.3 million authors, Kobo is reportedly the biggest foil to Amazon and Apple&rsquo;s quest for dominance in e-books. Its entry into India only signifies that the e-books business is going to see intense competition. <span class="s4"><br /></span></p>', 'E-books are taking off in India, with publishers and retailers pushing the pedal despite making losses.

(195, 16, '', 'Riding on an e-ticket', '<p class="p1">Whom the gods favour, they meet out of turn. At Mumbai&rsquo;s Siddhivinayak temple, that is facilitated by the Aashirwad pre-paid card. The refillable cash card helps devotees pay for a VIP <em>darshan</em>, make a donation or buy offerings for the lord. Not only is the card transferable, you can gift one too. Talk about counting one&rsquo;s blessings twice over. Launched in September 2013, the card was the result of an epiphany experienced by Ashok Nadkarni, Siddhivinayak temple&rsquo;s IT advisor, when he routinely boarded a BEST bus.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The a-ha moment triggered by the use of smart cards by regular commuters has since then found its way to the Shirdi Saibaba temple; Kolhapur&rsquo;s Mahalakshmi temple, too, may follow in its footsteps. More than divine intervention, it is this gradual word-of-mouth adoption that has powered the growth of Trimax IT Infrastructure &amp; Services, the firm behind the smart card initiative. Trimax stands for &lsquo;try maximum&rsquo; and founder Surya Prakash Madrecha, a science graduate, has been sticking to his philosophy since 1991, when he arrived from Udaipur to what was then called Bombay.</p>\n<p class="p3">At 23, many people don&rsquo;t know what to do with their lives but coming from a family that had a <em>kirana </em>store, money lending and wholesale sugar business, Madrecha and his four brothers always wanted to do their own thing. Even when he joined Sanghvi Electronics for his first job paying Rs 800 a month, he told his boss, Suresh Sanghvi, &ldquo;I want to start a business. I don&rsquo;t know what business and at what level, but I am joining you to learn and start something on my own.&rdquo; Sanghvi Electronics was into OEM manufacturing. In the early &rsquo;90s, almost all computer parts, be it a motherboard, RAM or hard disk, were imported from Taiwan and assembled here.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">After two years, the technical partner left the company (Sanghvi was the financial partner). An exodus resulted and most people who were electronic or computer science engineers left for bigger companies or started their own. Impressed with Madrecha&rsquo;s grit and diligence, Sanghvi let him run the company. Madrecha used to be in office at 8.30 am and leave at midnight. Over the next two years, Madrecha ran the company single-handedly. He recalls, &ldquo;Our customers, such as Onward, Nelito etc., were system integrators like we are today. They used to supply to banking and enterprise customers and make more money than us. The lesson learnt was: If you don&rsquo;t own the customer, then the margin will always be wafer-thin.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With his accumulated savings of Rs 50,000, Madrecha told Sanghvi that he wanted to start out on his own. &ldquo;Sanghvi gave me his Lamington Road office on rent for a Rs 50,000 deposit. He also gave me my first two customers, Dharamsi Morarji Chemical and Arthur Andersen, and that is how I started. Today, whatever I have become, I still feel that experience was very important,&rdquo; reminiscences Madrecha, who now doubles up as chairman and managing director of a Rs 1,000-crore company that he started from zilch 18 years ago. Trimax started off as an assembler, before gradually morphing into a systems integration company providing data centre services. In its earlier avatar, it also dabbled as a medical transcription company.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>One good turn&hellip;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">At the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), Madrecha&rsquo;s existing relationship as a hardware vendor turned out to be the binding glue. Trimax had done a cumulative business of Rs 20 lakh and when Omnitech InfoSolutions, the agency already appointed by the MSRTC for a piece-meal ticketing solution, failed to deliver, Trimax stepped in after winning an open tender in 2009.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It sourced a handheld ticketing device and designed and developed the software to connect MSRTC&rsquo;s depots and offices. For hinterland depots, the handheld has a USB port through which data is downloaded and fed into the system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Trimax not only put in place an electronic ticketing system for MSRTC, but also developed an online reservation system for it. Madrecha says when they developed the reservation system, their expectation was that it was going to be used mostly by Mumbai and Pune residents. Reality turned out otherwise, &ldquo;80% of the bookings continue to originate from areas such as Kolhapur, Solapur and Aurangabad for travel to Mumbai.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>All lined up- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The successful implementation at MSRTC soon resulted in more electronic ticket issuing machine (ETIM) projects. Other state-run transport companies, realising the benefits of improved data and better fleet management, started piling in. After MSRTC, Trimax implemented the system for BEST, Rajasthan and UP State Road Transport Corporations and the Bangalore Municipal Transport Corporation (BMTC). For the BMTC implementation currently underway, along with electronic ticketing, Trimax is developing a passenger information system that will keep commuters updated on bus timings and frequency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">For BEST, the company also launched a smart card. About 1.8 million smart cards carrying a one-month to three-month commuter pass have been sold so far. Madrecha can&rsquo;t suppress a laugh when recalling the initial public reaction to the announcement of the BEST pre-paid cards. &ldquo;Since the pre-paid smart card embedded a photo, people thought it could be used as an identity card. Therefore, when the card was launched, there was a kilometre-long queue at almost all points of sale.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">A little bit of history is relevant here as the Trimax initiative was the second attempt by BEST to launch smart cards. The first attempt was the Go Mumbai card, which had its share of shortcomings. Om Prakash Gupta, managing director, BEST, says, &ldquo;The Go Mumbai card had no verification system and one was not sure whether the commuter was the actual buyer. As BEST was losing revenue, we decided to revamp the system. Now, revenue leakage via reuse of tickets or commuter passes has been stopped as the current tickets come with these details.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">What also helped at BEST was that Gupta was familiar with the execution skills of Trimax, having dealt with it in his earlier capacity as managing director at MSRTC. It was during Gupta&rsquo;s tenure that MSRTC decided to upgrade its ticketing system. He recalls, &ldquo;When I was managing director at MSRTC, whenever I asked for route or revenue-related information, not only did the data come in very late, its legitimacy was also suspect.&rdquo; Madrecha points out the drastic reduction that resulted after the ETIM project was up and running. &ldquo;Earlier, it used to take them six months to reconcile how much money is lying where. Now, they know each depot&rsquo;s collection on a daily basis. They also get route-wise data in terms of how many passengers travelled and where, what is working and where they are losing money.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Revenue leakage via reuse of tickets or passes has stopped as the e-tickets come with these details" Om Prakash Gupta, managing director, BEST</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">At MSRTC, the whole system was designed from scratch, while for BEST, there was a ready template that needed to be customised to the city. Hence, the rollout was much faster. Says Gupta, &ldquo;What took us around 30 months at MSRTC was done here in 10 months. Having implemented the same at MSRTC, we knew where the time delays were.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">One of the technical problems that conductors encountered in the earlier days was the frequent jamming of the thermal paper roll on which the ticket was issued, which brings to mind the sight of conductors frequently banging their handhelds. It was later discovered that as the roll size shrunk, it used to shift within its chamber. Since the alignment used to shift, the paper used to jam, so guidance rollers were provided on both sides to keep the roll in place all the time.</p>\n<p class="p3">Madrecha recalls that at MSRTC, it took nine to 12 months just to train the conductors and get them comfortable with the system. There was a lot of resistance towards learning something new and there was fear about being replaced by a machine. &ldquo;We decided to not start with the 55-year-olds but to focus on the 30-year-olds, who were relatively new in the system and who were more open to using it. We trained people between 25 and 30 years of age and they realised they were able to save a couple of hours from their after-trip paperwork. After they shared their experience with the elder conductors, there was a bigger buy-in.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>Price for a prize</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">If it sounds like a picture perfect scenario, it isn&rsquo;t. Most of the state transport bodies are loss making. Even Mumbai&rsquo;s venerable BEST loses money on almost all its bus routes and has an accumulated loss of about Rs 4,000 crore on the transportation side.</p>\n<p class="p3">So, how does Trimax get these loss-making entities to fork out money for modernisation? It doesn&rsquo;t. Instead, under a &lsquo;pay per use&rsquo; model, it incurs all the expenditure and then recovers the costs on a per ticket basis (depending on the project, the cost varies from 10 paisa to 50 paisa a ticket). This it uses not only for its transport IT projects but for its system integration projects as well. Those who have availed of the scheme include BEST, Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation and the Osmanabad District Central Co-operative Bank (ODCCB).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In the case of ODCCB, Trimax&rsquo;s order book is worth Rs 32 crore and it expects to recover its investment over five years. Not having to incur initial capex may be prudent for the client, but does it not come at a cost for Trimax? Madrecha says co-operative banks will continue to be a focus area. &ldquo;Core banking for the majors is done, but co-operative banks and rural regional banks still need upgradation. Going to Osmanabad or Jalna and computerising 30 branches may not be easy, but that is the market where we see growth. Over the past couple of years, through implementing piece-meal solutions, we have established a comfort level with these small banks.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Running ahead- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">While his intent of focusing on SMEs and co-operative banks may be noble, the systems integration business, due to its low entry barrier, is inherently competitive. Due to the lack of pricing power, the firm shifted from time and materials contracts to fixed price ones to win new business. This sheer commoditisation in its core business of computer hardware and networking forced Trimax to look out for an area where it could hold its own against competition. ITMS, or integrated transport management systems, has turned out to be one, so far. Under this, Trimax executes projects under the build-operate-transfer model and hands it over after the agreed period.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Over the past five years, despite competition from UTI ITSL, DIMTS and TCS-owned CMC, Trimax has consciously focused on this segment. While topline growth is coming in systems integration and ITMS, it is at the cost of rising debt and piling receivables. While sourcing hardware and building data centres does cost money, there is also an additional investment that has to be made in developing the software, acquiring the GPS devices and handhelds as well as end-user training.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">This working capital requirement for system integration clients and upfront capex for BOT projects are the biggest drain on Trimax&rsquo;s financials. Then, as most BOT projects are for the government, Trimax runs the risk of late payments. Receivables climbed from Rs 301 crore in FY12 to #398 crore (of which about Rs 75 crore is &gt; six months) in FY13. To tide over its cash strained status, Trimax has kept adding debt. In FY13, total debt was Rs 288 crore, compared with Rs 230 crore in FY12.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The drain notwithstanding, Madrecha says it is hard for competitors to replicate what Trimax does in ITMS because of its legacy advantage. &ldquo;It is not just supplying of IT hardware, it is a five- to 10-year customer commitment. Competition is not much in this segment because more than IT capability, it is about operational capability,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>What the cards foretell</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Madrecha believes that infrastructure initiatives under the JNNURM will open up enough opportunities for Trimax. He is particularly hopeful about BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) getting operational in many Indian cities. &ldquo;Under JNNURM, about 20 cities were identified for BRT, but it is widely operational only in Ahmedabad. Pune, Nashik and Raipur are also potential BRT cities and each could be a Rs 250-crore technology implementation market. If the operations get outsourced, that would amount to an additional Rs 250 crore over a five-year period,&rdquo; he says. Incidentally, Pune did have a BRT service, before it was shelved due to encroachment resulting from inadequate infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In order to capture such contracts, Trimax is deepening its expertise in automatic fare collection (AFC) as well as turnstile technology. Madrecha opines, &ldquo;There are about five to 10 players in this market worldwide, spread across the UK, France, Japan and Korea. Our local operational experience could <br /> be a draw for those keen on entering India and we are open to having a collaborator for technology as well as equity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Even as it eyes potential BRT implementation, it continues to focus on its existing state road transport market. Here, after having offered the basic ETIM service, the attempt is to sell more solutions, such as fleet or fuel management. By availing of this, bus companies get precise data on fleet utilisation and can optimise their fuel spends.</p>\n<p class="p3">Then, there is the common mobility card (CMC) market, which Madrecha is most excited about. A CMC can be used across transportation systems in a city. Common examples are Octopus in Hong Kong or Oyster in London. &ldquo;Today, different reservation systems operate in islands. If someone wants to go from Bengaluru to Haridwar, then you have to take a flight or a train and then another bus or a private car. The entire booking should be seamless and our effort is to move in this direction.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">True, Trimax has the required competency in terms of smart cards and card reading machines and also has an established user base of smart cards, which can later on double up as a CMC. However, the catch is that if open access is unavailable, then getting various different systems to handshake is difficult. Currently, the most seamless reservation systems globally are the ones used by airlines and Trimax has a tall task ahead even if it intends to integrate just the railway and bus systems in India. Having implemented many road state transport contracts, Madrecha&rsquo;s company may have got attuned to some amount of bureaucratic red tape, but how Trimax will address the bureaucratic divide remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Given its dependence on government projects, Trimax&rsquo;s plan to aggressively scale up could hit a hurdle if it fails to navigate around government sloth and turf wars. The concept of a CMC has been bandied around for quite a while now but there is no city where it is used in its entirety. Delhi&rsquo;s More cards are the most advanced and can be used on the metro rail network as well as metro rail connecting buses. Nevertheless, the promise of a CMC seems to have excited several private equity investors. While BanyanTree was the earliest investor to come in, it was followed by Zephyr Peacock and then by Aditya Birla PE. Though their acquisition cost varies, currently, they hold 9.06%, 9.62% and 9.5% in the company, respectively.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Madrecha&rsquo;s business journey has been one of continuous transformation and now he is banking on the ITMS segment to deliver the next chunk of growth. All through, like most prudent businessmen, he has banked on relationships to grow. He continues to stay in touch with his first and only boss through their regular walks around Mumbai&rsquo;s Mahalakshmi race course. Therefore, when he says that his relationships are for keeps, it sounds anything but a canned line flowing from a glib operator&rsquo;s mouth. As Trimax&rsquo;s future is tied to government initiatives, pace could be an issue. Madrecha is aware of this reality and therefore remarks, &ldquo;Coordinating with different agencies and constituents is a challenge. Doing that will be the next leg of our journey.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>', 'Trimax IT Infrastructure is transforming from a plain vanilla integrator to a provider of transport management systems, but the pace could be a road block', '2', '', 0, '', 'riding-on-an-e-ticket-195', 190, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Riding on an e-ticket', 'Trimax IT Infrastructure is transforming from a plain vanilla integrator to a provider of transport management systems, but the pace could be a road block', '', '', '', 'Trimax IT Infra & Services,Aashirwad pre-paid card,E-ticket,MSRTC,BEST,BMTC', 0, NULL, '2015-01-21 18:29:24', '2015-01-22 11:39:58', '2014-02-01', 0),

(198, 20, '', 'Fall season', '<p class="p1">To borrow from Karl Marx, if&nbsp; &ldquo;religion is the opium of masses&rdquo;, then surely hope is the &lsquo;substance&rsquo; that gives the market its high. For what else would explain the subdued sense of optimism pervading the domestic equity market? Last fortnight, the benchmark index clocked its biggest single-day gain since November 25, 2013, jumping 375 points (1.81%) on January 13 to 21,134 points. Ditto with the Nifty, which ended 1.64% up, at 6,272.75, marking its biggest single-day gain since December 20, 2013.</p>\n<p class="p3">Not surprisingly, the likes of Abhay Laijawala, head of research at Deutsche Bank, are ready to believe that the markets are in for a real recovery. &ldquo;Economic growth has bottomed, the corporate earnings cycle is seeing a second successive quarter of recovery, investment starts are seeing a glimmer of hope, driven by public sector projects, and record domestic investor disenchantment with equities may be ebbing,&rdquo; mentions Laijawala in his 2014 outlook report.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But the fact remains that GDP growth estimates continue to be at sub-5% levels; the investment cycle is still to show signs of a recovery with over Rs 2 lakh crore worth of fresh projects being shelved during the September quarter and investor apathy is at its peak.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Surreal numbers- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Yet another fig leaf that sell-side analysts are hanging on to is the so-called recovery in earnings. After a 15-quarter low in the June quarter, when sales growth hit 2% and recovered 14% in the subsequent September quarter and showed double-digit PAT growth of (10%) after four quarters, there is the feeling that the recovery has begun. As the Street braces for the third quarter of earnings season, the consensus points to ending FY14 with a robust growth number. While most estimates are looking at 14% growth in earnings to Rs 1,351, Rajat Rajgariah, head of research, MOSL, expects the Sensex EPS to grow by 11% to Rs 1,317 and accelerate to 15% in FY15 to Rs 1,518. But considering that after the 22% y-o-y growth seen in FY11, the subsequent growth rates for FY12 and FY13 were around 9% and 5%, respectively, the estimates look exaggerated. Especially considering that a large part of the sales performance was driven by currency gains in the last quarter.</p>\n<p class="p3">Sharing the sense of scepticism in his report is Manishi Raychaudhari, head of research, BNP Paribas India: &ldquo;Notwithstanding the recent improvement in the earnings environment, we think growth estimates for some sectors, especially for FY15, are overstated. We highlight banks, autos, consumer staples and telecoms in particular.&rdquo; In fact, over FY09-FY13, defensives have done the most to keep the earnings momentum going by accounting for 43% of the EPS CAGR over the period, with industrials being a drag at -2%. Given that financials at 22% was the next big CAGR earnings driver over the same period, the picture does not make for a good reading as net NPA and fresh debt restructuring proposals have been gaining ground. While earnings growth estimates for FY14 are 9-14% for now, with too many variables at play, especially with general elections round the corner, the guessing game has just begun.&nbsp;</p>', 'The Street is sensing a recovery in earnings, but deep down, the picture tells a different story', '5', '', 0, '', 'fall-season-198', 193, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Fall season', 'The ', '', '', '', 'Sensex,Nifty,Economic growth,GDP', 0, NULL, '2015-01-22 12:41:14', NULL, '2014-02-01', 0),
(199, 20, '', 'Home delivery', '<p class="p1">On December 31, 2013, even as Mumbai resounded to the sound of late night partying and the BSE remained shut, legendary investor Radhakishan Damani was turning his eagle eye to an unexpected target, picking up four million shares at an average Rs 43 a share for a 4.6% stake in logistics and surface express major Gati. Damani, arguably one of India&rsquo;s best value investors, has an enviable track record of making the right calls. Granted, this wasn&rsquo;t his only move in the logistics sector over the new year &mdash; through his investment companies Brightstar Investments and Derive Investments, Damani also picked up over 2.5 million shares for a 3.5% stake in Transport Corporation of India (incidentally, Gati was carved out of TCI in 1989) &mdash; but why Gati? After all, the stock has been facing heavy weather for some time as a protracted recession and diminishing export import trade has put a lid on its growth.</p>\n<p class="p3">Indeed, Gati has been reeling under debt for the past few years. As of March 2012, it had a debt of Rs 534 crore with a topline of Rs 1,180 crore. To be fair, the Secunderabad-based firm did take steps to reorganise and pare debt. In June 2012, it entered into a joint venture agreement with Japan&rsquo;s Kintetsu Worldwide Express, under which Gati hived off its core surface express division into a separate entity, selling 30% stake in the process and gaining Rs 148 crore through equity infusion by the Japanese firm. With this, the company transferred Rs 330 crore of its debt burden to the new company. Much of the newly-infused capital from the deal was used to repay debt, with a little being used for working capital requirements and upgrading existing infrastructure with the Japanese partner&rsquo;s know-how.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">As of Q1FY14 (Gati follows a July-June financial year), on a consolidated basis, debt is still Rs 392 crore. Says CFO Sanjeev Jain, &ldquo;Most of our debt now comprises term loans, which we may be able to refinance at a lower rate of interest since Care and Icra have given the new division an -A rating.&rdquo; To be sure, interest costs for Gati Kintetsu have already reduced from Rs 63 crore in FY12 to Rs 44 crore in FY13.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Corrosive debt- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">As for Gati, it still has a standalone debt burden of Rs 210 crore comprising FCCB bonds worth $22 million repayable by December 2016 and commercial loans for working capital for the freighter and e-commerce business to the tune of Rs 70 crore. Jain explains that Gati intends to sell a land parcel in the NCR region to redeem the bonds. And coming to the working capital loans, the management believes the e-commerce business will deliver exceptional growth that will take care of any loan obligations. &ldquo;The e-commerce business is seeing 100% y-o-y growth and the cash flows generated here will make up for any lacunae in any other business segment and see us through,&rdquo; says Mahendra Agarwal, founder and CEO, Gati. Indeed, Gati has a target of achieving Rs 1,200 crore turnover from the e-commerce business by 2020, up nearly 50 times from Rs 25 crore in FY13. And perhaps that, in a nutshell, explains Damani&rsquo;s interest in the company. Being in the retail business himself with his D-Mart chain of stores, Damani surely knows how the retail business is booming both online and offline.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Will this click?</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Currently valued at $13 billion (Rs 80,000 crore) by KPMG and the Internet and Mobile Association of India, the Indian e-commerce sector is set to grow at 30% CAGR, compared with 9% globally. Associated industries such as logistics and warehousing will come in for their share of growth as well. Gati has been quick to realise the opportunities here. In 2005, it created a separate division catering to e-retail. Set up with an investment of #5 crore, the division is setting up a dedicated &lsquo;e-fulfillment&rsquo; centre in Mumbai to provide last-mile connectivity, managing inventory, packing and distribution. It has a fleet of 200 vehicles and 300 bikes catering to 6,700 pin codes across the country, including in tier 2 and 3 cities. Gati&rsquo;s e-commerce division is its fastest-growing, clocking 20% quarterly growth for the past few quarters. It has also posted 20% plus Ebitda margins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Though Gati runs its own online marketplace called Gati E-connect, where vendors register and maintain their own catalogue of products and decide pricing, business from this is minuscule. Most of its revenue comes from established online retailers such as Myntra, Naaptol, TV18 and Flipkart. Gati currently delivers 15,000 packages per day, which the management intends to scale up to 30,000 per day by end-FY14. From a revenue of Rs 12 crore in FY12, it now has a revenue of Rs 25 crore and the target is to achieve Rs 65 crore by end-FY14. Over the next five years, the company expects the e-commerce business to grow at a CAGR of 75%, which will result in revenues over Rs 1,200 crore by 2020. The division already generates a free cash flow of Rs 10 crore, which should only increase exponentially as business grows. &ldquo;The revenue from the e-commerce segment will be enough to sustain Gati as a consolidated entity. Its share of the revenue mix is increasing and we expect this division to be more profitable than our distribution business,&rdquo; says Jain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">To achieve this, Gati will expand its network to include more locations and streamline its commercial processes such as cash on delivery (COD). The group&rsquo;s big rivals in this space are Blue Dart and Aramex, both established players themselves. What sets Gati apart? &ldquo;We have an in-depth understanding of COD services and an extensive reach, including world-class warehouse and transportation management systems and an ability to deliver goods just two days after the transaction, which is an industry best,&rdquo; declares Jain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Gati is one of the country''s largest organised logistics players, with a pan-India presence" - Kavita Vempalli, research analyst, Nirmal Bang Securities</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Industry-wide, the changing shopping habits of Indians, led by the convenience of shopping from home as well as increased internet penetration are driving e-commerce growth. The big opportunity, though, really lies in the opening up of B2C e-commerce to FDI (100% FDI in B2B e-commerce is already allowed). If that goes through &mdash; the expectation is that the nod may come through as early as March 2014 &mdash; there is every possibility that big international players will seek JVs with domestic logistics players to ensure a seamless supply chain. And given that 90% of the logistics business in India is in the unorganised sector, it is the few established players, including Gati, that stand to gain tremendously. Kavita Vempalli, research analyst at Nirmal Bang Securities, is gung-ho about the company&rsquo;s prospects. &ldquo;Gati is one of India&rsquo;s largest organised logistics player with a pan-India presence. So it would be a preferred partner of choice for any international player.&rdquo; But will its e-commerce drive be enough to offset Gati&rsquo;s underperformance in other businesses?</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Slowing things down</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">For the past several years, the Gati group&rsquo;s Achilles&rsquo; heel has been its shipping division. Hived off as a separate subsidiary &mdash; Gati Ship &mdash; in FY12, the business has been making losses due to the slowdown in the exim trade, an inability to procure cargo orders and the fact that two of its vessels were dry docked for a significant period of time. For FY13, Gati Ship registered a revenue of Rs&nbsp;25.4 crore, a negative Ebitda of <span class="s1">#</span>10.8 crore and a loss of Rs&nbsp;31.4 crore, compared with negative Ebitda of Rs&nbsp;7.3 crore and a loss of Rs&nbsp;10.4 crore in FY12. In May 2013, the group divested 40% of its stake in Gati Ship to Hyderabad&rsquo;s Riba Constructions for Rs&nbsp;20 crore. &ldquo;If the company&rsquo;s losses aren&rsquo;t contained in the next two quarters, there will be a further divesture where Gati becomes a minority shareholder. We could also look to exit the business completely,&rdquo; Jain says. Analysts second that less-than optimistic view. &ldquo;Unless there is some sign of revival in exim trade, the shipping business will continue to be in the doldrums,&rdquo; says Vempalli. &ldquo;At a loss of Rs&nbsp;3 crore per quarter, it definitely affects the group&rsquo;s consolidated <span class="s2">PAT</span>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"If Gati Ship''s losses aren''t contained in the next two quarters, there will be a further divesture" - Sanjeev Jain, CFO, Gati</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Shipping isn&rsquo;t the only division that&rsquo;s ailing. In 2007, Gati acquired a cold chain business, Kausar, catering to clients in the healthcare, meat and poultry, biopharma and quick service restaurant sectors. While it has plans to open its first cold chain warehouse in Gurgaon in association with a private equity firm, the numbers for Gati Kausar aren&rsquo;t encouraging. The division generated a revenue of Rs 45.8 crore, an Ebitda of Rs 4.9 crore and a loss of Rs 2.4 crore in FY13, compared with a revenue of Rs 40.2 crore, an Ebitda of Rs 5.9 crore and a PAT of Rs 2.1 crore in FY12. The loss in FY13 was on account of higher depreciation from investments made while acquiring a 65-vehicle fleet in FY13. Analysts aren&rsquo;t too worried because Gati Kausar is already making cash profits, although break even at the PAT level is not expected before mid-FY15.</p>\n<p class="p3">The silver lining for the group is that the core business is actually doing pretty well. Now known as Gati Kintetsu Express, this is the express distribution and supply chain subsidiary and contributed 82% to group turnover in FY13 (<em>see: Adding it up</em>). The overall economic downturn, the slowdown in GDP and IIP, especially in the automotive sector (a key contributor to revenue), has taken a toll on this business as well. Nonetheless, says Vempalli, &ldquo;Owing in part to the restructuring of the business with Kintetsu, debt and interest costs reduction, a renewed focus on the SME sector, acquisition of Japanese clients and gradual recovery in the economy, Gati Kintetsu has managed to outperform its peers.&rdquo; In fact, it registered an Ebitda of Rs 87.8 crore and a PAT of Rs 33.6 crore in FY13 versus an Ebitda of Rs 15.3 crore and PAT of Rs 1.1 crore in FY12. Gati Kintetsu gets 70% of its business from the road transport segment, with the rest split evenly between air and rail. Here, Gati is the No.2 player, after Blue Dart, with a 20% share of the organised logistics business in India. It has a pan-India reach, serving 653 of the country&rsquo;s 657 districts with 4,000 leased trucks, seven rail bogies and a network of 16 major warehouses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Adding it up- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Still, FY13 was a difficult year for most logistics players and Gati is no exception. The weakening in exim trade, increasing fuel costs, a slowdown in the air freight business and tight liquidity affected the firm adversely. How did it cope? &ldquo;We tried to increase our topline. We optimised our surface transport network by sending vehicles on different routes and cut down on intermediary hubs for transporting parcels. We also passed on cost hikes to our customers.&rdquo; Tech initiatives and enhanced service offerings have also helped growth &mdash; from real-time tracking of consignments and vehicles and 24/7 CCTV coverage of transport hubs to minimise losses, to offering COD services and giving sales staff tablets to enhance the pick-up process. &ldquo;COD and real-time tracking of shipments through SMS and email have helped customers and sharply aided our growth, both in the surface, express and e-commerce segments,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">Can Gati maintain its speed if the slowdown persists? Certainly. Given the inefficiencies in the unorganised logistics industry, there&rsquo;s plenty of room for growth. The explosive growth in e-commerce, too, will help. Also, the introduction of the goods and services tax (GST) will prove to be a big driver. Fewer warehouses with more packages and fully-utilised trucks will mean more business efficiency for Gati in its surface distribution and supply chain divisions. But key risks remain, including weak global growth, aggressive pricing by competitors and infrastructural and bureaucratic hurdles. Also, as J Dhananjayan, founder, Artha Capital, points out, &ldquo;The business has a very low margin of safety. The fact that the promoter has pledged much of his stakeholding also marks a red flag in my opinion.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">By Jain&rsquo;s own admission, Gati&rsquo;s cash position for the next two years will be &ldquo;a bit stretched&rdquo;. But after that, he expects the group to post free cash flows. Capex spending is also minimal, since Gati prefers to lease its vehicles. But even with excellent growth in the surface transport, e-commerce and cold chain divisions, the fact remains that Gati is overleveraged. That can only be taken care of if Gati can sustain strong cash generation. Damani possibly believes that can happen, which is why he might have bought in with such conviction. Gati as well as TCI have been on fire since the purchase became public. From a price of Rs 27 on December 13, the stock now trades at Rs 65. This run has more than doubled Gati&rsquo;s market cap. At the current price of Rs 65, it is trading at a steep price-earnings ratio of 22X. The stock has potential, but one can wait for it to cool off after the euphoric rise before buying. &nbsp;</p>', 'Will Gati''s e-commerce push make the overleveraged logistics player bankable?', '11', '', 0, '', 'home-delivery-199', 194, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Home delivery ', 'Will Gati''s e-commerce push make the overleveraged logistics player bankable?', '', '', '', 'Gati,Radhakishan Damani,E-commerce logistics,E-retail,Blue Dart,Aramex', 0, NULL, '2015-01-22 12:43:02', '2015-01-22 13:05:07', '2014-02-01', 0),

(201, 24, '', 'Unlocking the habit', '<p class="p1">Security is the last thing on V Raghunathan&rsquo;s mind when he buys a lock. So much so, that he once bought a lock that is itself kept under lock and key in a living room cupboard at his home in a posh Hyderabad locality. This particular cupboard is home to about 650 old and antique locks that have been collected over a period of 30 years by Raghunathan, the 69-year-old CEO of GMR Varalakshmi Foundation, the CSR arm of GMR.</p>\n<p class="p3">What began as a fascination with just one rare lock 39 years ago has now become a serious hobby for Raghunathan, who is counted among the best lock collectors in the country. &ldquo;I was on vacation with my wife and the cottage we were staying at had a unique-looking lock. I was fascinated by it and offered to buy the guard a new lock in exchange for that one. Little did he know what he was giving up on,&rdquo; laughs Raghunathan, who scored his second from his grandfather&rsquo;s house in Lalgudi village, Tamil Nadu. Every holiday or work trip since then has included a trek to local flea markets, junk stores and antique stores. &ldquo;I love travelling to Gujarat and Rajasthan because these states have the best collections,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">The former professor of finance at IIM Ahmedabad and president of ING Vysya calls his locks mechanical puzzles, and they truly seem so. Apart from varying in size and shape, some of the locks also have trick settings. The biggest lock measures over 3.5 feet, the smallest is about half a centimetre long, the heaviest weighs 30 kg and the lightest of all is just a few grams. There are even locks in the shape of keys themselves.</p>\n<p class="p3">One of Raghunathan&rsquo;s favourites &mdash; as difficult as it is for him to choose &mdash; is a lock with five keys but only one visible keyhole. Unlocking four successive keyholes reveals the final one. &ldquo;There are times when I spend 10 days doing nothing but trying to crack a trick lock. For some, there are no keys, so I get my key-maker to design new ones,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While flea markets are his primary sources for adding to his collection, Raghunathan also deals with exclusive antique sellers. &ldquo;If they get a lock they think I might be interested in buying, they get in touch,&rdquo; he explains. He maintains a hand-drawn catalogue of all his locks, complete with details about its shape, the trick to open it and the date of purchase.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Raghunathan&rsquo;s fascination&nbsp;with locks has made its way into his latest book, which was launched early last year. In the book &mdash; <em>Locks, Mahabharata and Mathematics &mdash; </em>he connects the titular subjects together and draws a parallel between the trickery involved in locks and mathematics, relating it to<br /> stories from the epic poem.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">One day will come, Raghunathan says, when he might just sell his collection to someone who will appreciate and preserve it. But he doesn&rsquo;t want them to be donated to a museum, where he says no one will bother to check them out. &ldquo;Though I have spent a lot of money collecting these locks, their value is more emotional than monetary to me.

Goldsmith, a disciple of legendary management guru Peter Drucker, talks about how business leaders need to realise that the success achieved by them is not final and there is a higher but simpler road ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Goldsmith identifies several key habits that are formed at the workplace and the ways to overcome them. He says that the fact that successful people tend to be delusional isn&rsquo;t that bad. Our belief in our own wonderfulness fills us with a needed sense of self-confidence. But, Goldsmith points out, while our self-confident delusions can help us achieve great things, they can also make us resistant to change. The corporate world is full of talented individuals who have worked extremely hard to reach coveted management positions. To them, Goldsmith asks: where are you headed and do you have it in you to reach the sky?</p>\n<p class="p3">The part I liked most about the book was Goldsmith&rsquo;s advice on the importance of apologising, listening and thanking. The author hits the nail on the head when he says that &ldquo;If you realise that you have done something wrong, either very recently or in the past, apologise&rdquo;. It is a simple and lucid formula to clear your conscience and your relationship with your co-worker, even if it requires swallowing a bit of pride. Listening, Goldsmith says, is the first cardinal rule of management, which most of our leaders seem to have forgotten. I agree with Goldsmith when he says that when someone speaks to you, listen to him or her. Do not interrupt and always try to understand before responding. And lastly, giving your colleagues handwritten thank you notes will make their day. Go ahead, try it; it&rsquo;s really worth the effort.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Goldsmith&rsquo;s effervescent and matter of fact narration captures the reader&rsquo;s thought process and forces him or her to look for better outcomes in life and at work. Even the smallest positive change can bring about a real impact in the organisation, so why shy away from making one? Goldsmith exhorts leaders to be open to co-workers and encourage open dialogue. He says an effective organisation is one that recognises problems and nips them in the bud with utmost honesty and sensitivity. I would recommend this book to all my fellow leaders as a great start on the road to self-improvement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Insights</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Is innovation driven by investment</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p1">Does the ownership model of a company decide how creative or original it will be with its ideas and, hence, patents?

(205, 15, '', 'Eastern delight', '<p class="p1">On a cold Friday morning in 2003, as 63-year old KD Paul, founder-chairman of the Rs 700-crore biscuit brand Bisk Farm, fidgeted around his Siliguri hotel room overlooking the hills, he got a call from the managing director of one India&rsquo;s prime national biscuit company for a takeover offer. Struck by this bolt from the blue, Paul mulled over the proposed partnership, discussing the issue with his son-in-law Vijay Singh. It was Singh who convinced Paul to turn down the tempting offer. &ldquo;He explained why it was a bad idea to dilute our brand identity by joining hands with a bigger player. It didn&rsquo;t matter how big the potential partner was; it was more important for us to maintain our individuality,&rdquo; says Paul. A decade later, this resolve was severely tested as retail czar Kishore Biyani came calling. Over a cup of tea at Paul&rsquo;s office on Sarat Bose Road, Biyani offered to truck the 4,500-employee-strong Bisk Farm&rsquo;s products across the country to all its retail distribution outlets, adding that he respected the company&rsquo;s strong brand ethic and equity, popularity across east India and the variety on offer. Much like the earlier offer, Paul turned this one down too, this time because of challenges posed by transportation costs, then hovering at around Rs 40,000-Rs 50,000 for 800 cartons in a single truck.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Today, this Kolkata-based regional player is among one of India&rsquo;s premier biscuits and snacks brands, covering 17 states and accounting for around 5% of the branded biscuit market of Rs 12,000 crore. Though the brand has a presence across India, its major markets are West Bengal and the northeast; the company is also present in Bihar, Rajasthan, eastern UP and Maharashtra and plans to expand into north India soon. According to Singh, the brand currently enjoys market shares of 27% in the east and 50% in the northeast, registering sales of Rs 60 crore per month, compared with Rs 33 lakh a month in 2003. Under the umbrella of Saj Food Products, Bisk Farm&rsquo;s top-selling brands are The Top, Googly, Spicy and Cream Cracker, which together contribute around 35-40% to its total revenue. Its range isn&rsquo;t limited to biscuits, though: with cakes, rusks and cookies on the list as well, Saj Food Products shows all indications of becoming a complete food company. And with Bisk Farm raking in #540 crore in total income and Rs 4.5 crore in profits in FY13, it is very close to achieving its dream. &ldquo;As a brand, Bisk Farm, has evolved to become synonymous with farm-fresh quality and purity. It has a European look and feel, which enhances its global appeal,&rdquo; adds the 44-year-old Singh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Saj Food Products, on the other hand, manufactures biscuits under the Bisk Farm brand. Bisk Farm benefits from Saj Food&rsquo;s strong market position in the Indian biscuits industry, backed by an established portfolio, regular introduction of new products and distribution heft across geographies. The company offers around 75 varieties of biscuits and other bakery products in around 130 stock-keeping units (SKUs), and maintains its profitability through a mix of price increases and new product/SKU introductions. Bisk Farm is also a contract manufacturer for Nestle&rsquo;s noodle brand Maggi in eastern India, which contributes 1% to the company&rsquo;s revenue.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>Rising to the top</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">&ldquo;It seems like just yesterday when, over dinner, I broached the idea of starting a biscuit company of our own with my family. Vijay was really enthusiastic about it, and we have never looked back since then,&rdquo; says Paul. Saj Food Products, part of the Kolkata-based Aparna Food Products empire, started life with Paul and Singh as its promoters and a seed capital of Rs 10 crore, which was raised partly (Rs 7 crore) by selling Paul&rsquo;s 28% stake in Calcutta Chemicals to Henkel in 1999 and partly (Rs 3 crore) via bank loans. The Aparna Group is a leading distribution house in east India, engaged in delivering consumer and pharmaceutical products to reputed companies in the region for over 35 years. At that point Paul felt that if he could leverage his distribution network for the benefit of other brands, why not create a brand of his own.</p>\n<p class="p2">But the initial years were far from rosy and in 2003 the company hit a lean patch. Weighed down by a lack of manufacturing expertise, marketing understanding and distribution capacity, coupled with a failure to create brand awareness, the company&rsquo;s promoters were all but ready to give up. Hit with losses of over #15 crore and sagging sales, Bisk Farm was teetering on the brink of closure. Though biggies such as Parle, Britannia and ITC lined up with takeover offers, no one was willing to pay a good price for the brand. That&rsquo;s when the promoters decided to rope in ad filmmakers Anik Dutta and Soumik Mishra and Manoj Lunia of local advertising agency LookAd India. The trio came up with a three-pronged creative strategy &mdash; think different, think local and break the clutter &mdash; to turn around the fortunes of the company. To aid this change in marketing, Singh toured Bisk Farm&rsquo;s operation and manufacturing facilities in India with new recruit Arpan Paul, sprucing up the company rolls, bringing young blood on board and strengthening the distribution team.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Bisk Farm Factory - Image</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">This was an especially tough transformation, given the industry Bisk Farm operates in. The Rs 12,000-crore domestic branded biscuit industry is dominated by organised players such as Britannia, Parle Products and ITC, which account for 70% of the market. While there are local players such as Kwality and Priya, the unorganised sector &mdash; comprised small bakery units, cottage industries and household-type manufacturing &mdash; dominates the other 30% of the market.</p>\n<p class="p2">A significant landmark for Bisk Farm, then, was the year 2004, when the company was able to push sales to Rs 25 crore, from Rs 9 crore the previous year. This came on the back of improved distribution, manufacturing and a smart media strategy. &ldquo;We spent around Rs 2 crore on advertising and promotion that year; we got into the television advertising space with a vengeance. We occupied prime-time space on well-known channels, broadcasting creative and interesting commercials with the help of the ad gurus of the time,&rdquo; explains Singh. The carpet-bombing continued in the print space as well. Backed by a strong distribution network now, the company reaped the benefits of a revamped brand strategy. &ldquo;What helped was the fact that we were known for constant innovation across the spectrum, with brands such as Top and Googly being the most popular among customers,&rdquo; says Singh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>Inflection point</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">But a big change post-2007 was the introduction of new categories such as rusks and cakes. &ldquo;There was a clear shift in consciousness. We were evolving from a regional player to a player with an eye on the national space,&rdquo; says Singh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Parle Products&rsquo; general manager for marketing Pravin Kulkarni believes that Bisk Farm has made its mark in the biscuit industry because of the attention it pays to minute details. &ldquo;The determining factors for success in this field are out-and-out innovation or being the first in each category. Bisk Farm has an advantage over its bigger rivals, thanks to its understanding of local nuances and innovations,&rdquo; says Kulkarni.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Innovation and being the first in a category are the determinants of success in the biscuits business" - Pravin Kulkarni, general manager, marketing, Parle Products</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Another factor that drives Bisk Farm&rsquo;s mass appeal is its popularity with urban housewives. &ldquo;Urban middle class families are developing a taste for products that have aspirational value and this segment has grown to become a big driver of volumes for us. For now, we are focusing our attention on this segment,&rdquo; says Singh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Growing at a 15-20% annual CAGR, the Indian packaged food industry &mdash; which includes snacks, ready-to-eat food, health food and functional food &mdash; is likely to touch $30 billion by 2015 from the current level of $15 billion, according to a study by Assocham. Some of the factors that are fueling this growth are the arrival of food-related MNCs in India, the rising popularity of quick-service restaurants, modern retail trade and changing urban lifestyles, adds the report. The snack and beverages segment includes several big domestic and MNC brands right from Hindustan Unilever to home-grown Halidrams.</p>\n<p class="p2">But in Bisk Farm&rsquo;s case, the chief rival, Britannia, holds an estimated 38% share of the market and boasts of a reach of over 3.8 million retail outlets and is present in over 40% of Indian homes. That&rsquo;s not surprising considering Britannia&rsquo;s first-mover advantage and well-fortified, strong distribution network. &ldquo;Also, unlike Britannia, Bisk Farm is not a national brand yet,&rdquo; explains Singh. However, Singh believes the real game-changer for Bisk Farm will be the introduction of the proposed goods and services tax, which he believes to be more reasonable as compared with the current regional tax regime, across the country. Biscuits are taxed at a rate of 14.5-16% the value of goods across India, a figure that is at par with that of luxury goods. &ldquo;We can bring down prices only if taxes are reduced,&rdquo; he points out. Singh adds that manufacturers should also be allowed to reduce grammage of product packets, and logistics players should improve efficiencies to bring down distribution costs. &ldquo;Fixing taxation issues could also give FMCG and retail players a big boost. It would definitely bring down fixed costs,&rdquo; says a Mumbai-based analyst who tracks the sector.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Bisk Farm Factory- Image 2</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">But Bisk Farm isn&rsquo;t banking on such unpredictable factors alone; in future, it plans to drive growth through product innovations and improved quality, Singh adds. The company plans to open three more outlets of Just Baked, its confectionery retail store, across Kolkata by the end of this year, and 20 more by next year-end. The idea behind the model was to add the company&rsquo;s own range of bakery products. &ldquo;We will invest Rs 12 lakh-15 lakh in each store,&rdquo; says Singh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Analysts, however, don&rsquo;t predict a smooth journey for the company, as the fate of the snack food industry is tied to the state of the economy. The weak, inflationary environment has hit all snack food makers equally, with a dip in demand due to lower volumes and a rise in fuel costs leading to a decline in operating margins. But Singh points out that the pain is common: be it for Bisk Farm or for the biggies. &ldquo;The cost of our main ingredients such as flour, milk and sugar went through the roof. Plus, fuel costs shot up, leading to an increase in operating and logistics costs as fuel constitutes 10% of our overall costs. Hence, if this situation persists, we and everyone else will suffer,&rdquo; says Singh. The management though is banking on sales volumes to offset the pressure on margins. &ldquo;We have shifted our focus to tier 2 and tier 3 cities,&rdquo; Singh adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Bisk Farm is also looking to expand its footprint to nineteen states in the next year-and-a-half. &ldquo;By 2015, we should be done with our plans for building a national footprint, at a cost of around Rs 250 crore,&rdquo; Singh concludes. For a regional brand that came back from the brink, Bisk Farm does have the right ingredients to make itself count.&nbsp;</p>', 'Kolkata’s Bisk Farm spurned offers from industry biggies to create a powerful regional biscuits brand.

(206, 12, '', 'Gold''s own country', '<p class="p1">Going by the number of puns, proverbs, metaphors and fables that abound in praise &mdash; or criticism &mdash; of the yellow metal across the world, it would be safe to assume that it is not just Indian companies or the general population alone that is obsessed with gold. Why, if even a renowned fund like Warburg Pincus can bet Rs 1,200 crore on Thrissur-based jewellery brand Kalyan Jewellers after suffering a 90% loss on an earlier jewellery investment, who can blame lesser mortals? In what was perhaps the biggest PE investment in the Indian jewellery sector so far, Warburg Pincus in October 2014 inked a deal with Kalyan Jewellers, one of India&rsquo;s largest jewellery retailers, whose reach has even spread to the UAE. &ldquo;While there was a lot of interest from other PE players, we decided to go with Warburg Pincus because we were on the same wavelength and had the exact same vision on how to grow the business,&rdquo; says Ramesh Kalyanaraman, executive director, Kalyan Jewellers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We decided to go with Warburg Pincus because we had the same vision on how to grow the business" - Ramesh Kalyanaraman, executive director, Kalyan Jewellers</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">For Warburg Pincus, this was its second investment in the jewellery sector. In 2011, the company had exited the aforementioned five-year-old arrangement with gems and jewellery exporter Vaibhav Gems at a 90% loss. But, more importantly, its deal with Kalyan Jewellers is the second-biggest bet that Warburg Pincus has taken on an Indian company since its investment in Bharti Tele-Ventures ($290 million), which is the biggest winner in the fund&rsquo;s Indian portfolio.&nbsp;So, what is it that makes Warburg Pincus bullish on the Indian jewellery market in general, and on Kalyan Jewellers in particular? One reason could be the fact that the ornaments major represents the change that has transformed the Indian jewellery market in the past decade, with consumers moving from buying only from their trusted family jeweller to demanding good quality and a wider range of products. &ldquo;Customers have now become more discerning and they are no longer just price-sensitive. They want to be assured of good quality and do not mind paying a premium price for exclusive designs,&rdquo; says Rajiv Popley, director, Popley Group.</p>\n<p class="p3">While it is true that India&rsquo;s demand for gold and other precious jewellery has always been insatiable, over the years, there has been a distinct change in the way Indians are buying gold, giving these jewellers the confidence to step out of their traditional strongholds and enter new markets. In the past, families would frequent the same jeweller over generations, convinced that the establishment would not cheat them in terms of pricing and the quality of the gold. The first disruption in the market came when the Tata Group launched its jewellery brand Tanishq in 1995 with the intention of selling jewellery uniform in design, quality and price, a move that changed the landscape of the jewellery market. This meant that you could purchase ornaments in one city and get them repaired or exchanged for a new set in another city, no longer tied down to one establishment or city. With more people moving out of their hometowns for work and income levels rising across board, consumers preferred switching to a retailer with a national presence; the Tata brand name was an added advantage as they would no longer have to worry about the quality of the gold.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Branded and loving it</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">This paradigm shift from a clutch of unorganised players to a standardised and branded retail jewellery chain opened up new markets for regional jewellers. Larger players such as Kalyan Jewellers sensed that customising its offerings to suit local tastes and standardising the quality of gold it worked with would open up new opportunities for the company outside its traditional market. And that&rsquo;s exactly what it did: from a single store in Thrissur in 1993, Kalyan Jewellers now boasts of 72 stores across the country and nine in the UAE. Today, Kalyanaraman is a man in a hurry, opening 13 stores in the past two to three months, with five of them springing up in a single day in Kerala; his target is to open an additional 28 stores by March 2015. While the cash raised by the stake sale to Warburg Pincus will be used to fund these outlets, the company will also invest Rs 300 crore - 400 crore to increase their manufacturing capacity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Kalyan Jewellers is not alone in its singular zeal to expand &mdash; retailers such as Joyalukkas, PC Jewellers (PCJ) and Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri (TBZ) have also jumped onto this bandwagon. Mumbai-based jeweller TBZ has been around for nearly 150 years now, a family business that has evolved over the years to its current network of 28 stores across 22 cities. It now plans to increase its footprint to 55-60 retail stores over the next two years. &ldquo;The company is looking at future retail expansion from&nbsp; 91,000 sq ft to 150,000 sq ft in the next few years through a mix of co-owned and franchise stores, which is an asset light model,&rdquo; says Prem Hinduja, CEO, TBZ. If research estimates are to be believed, there is enough space for this expansion &mdash; the Indian jewellery market is estimated to be worth around Rs 3 lakh crore today and is likely to grow to Rs 5 lakh crore by 2018, according to a study by Ficci-AT Kearney. About 80% of all jewellery purchases are still wedding-related, while the rest are discretionary purchases.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Coming of age- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">While analysts peg the organised players&rsquo; share of the industry at 20%, only 5% of the players have a pan-India presence. Brands such as Kalyan Jewellers, Joyalukkas, TBZ and PCJ, which have plans to expand across the country, are hoping to take away market share from unorganised players and are betting on rising income levels in tier 2 and tier 3 towns to fuel demand for branded jewellery. For instance, Delhi-based PC Jewellers, which currently has 47 stores across 38 cities, aims to open 20 showrooms over the next five years. About 80% of this expansion is expected to be in tier 2 and tier 3 cities; the brand recently opened showrooms in Patna, Jammu, Guwahati, Ranchi, Mathura and Kolkata. &ldquo;We see a lot more opportunities in tier 1 and tier 2 towns, where some of the larger players are not yet present, giving us a first-mover advantage,&rdquo; says Balram Garg, managing director, PC Jewellers. The brand is also exploring the franchisee route for expansion in tier 3 towns. &ldquo;Small towns don&rsquo;t require much investment and provide us better access to local talent,&rdquo; adds Garg. According to him, the capex required to open a new store is around #45 crore, the figure dipping to Rs 27 crore in tier 1 towns and to #20 crore in tier 2 and tier 3 towns, with 90% of the costs going towards inventory; these stores break even within 8-12 months as well. PCJ expects expansion to drive revenue growth by 25% in FY15 and aims to triple its revenue by 2019, with the funds coming from its 2012 IPO bounty of Rs 600 crore.</p>\n<p class="p3">This expansion is important for growth as &mdash; like any other retail business &mdash; getting the right location is critical in the jewellery segment. But there is one thing that is even more crucial than location &mdash; the product. While customers prefer <em>kundan</em> and diamond jewellery in the north, in south India, traditional designs in plain gold rule the roost. &ldquo;Customer preferences vary from region to region. We have a thorough understanding of every region and the local preferences in jewellery and, with the help of our designers and craftsmen, create collections keeping basic preferences in mind,&rdquo; says Joy Alukkas, chairman of the eponymous brand. Often, design preferences may vary based on different localities within the same city. &ldquo;Our design mix depends on the location and the consumers there. For instance, our product offering is altered to cater to a more cosmopolitan crowd in an upmarket location like Bandra.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We have an understanding of every region''s preferences and create collections accordingly" - Joy Alukkas, chairman and MD, Joyalukkas</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Moving to the suburbs, we retail more traditional offerings catering to a predominantly Gujarati population in Borivali and Ghatkopar and Maharashtrian audiences further ahead in Thane and Vashi,&rdquo; says Popley. The Popley group, which operates in India and Dubai at the moment, is looking to expand further to four&nbsp; stores in Mumbai suburbs by the end of the current fiscal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We capture the interest of young working women so that they buy their wedding jewellery from us" - Balram Garg, managing director, PC Jewellers</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Demographic variations are not limited to just regional preferences, however. Thanks to the increasing tribe of working women, lightweight everyday jewellery is also enjoying its moment in the sun, and jewellers are hard at work to capture this audience. While Tanishq led the way with its work-wear collection Mia, Most brands now have a line targeting the working woman. &ldquo;We want to capture the interest of young working women early in life so that we become their preferred choice when the time comes for them to buy their wedding jewellery,&rdquo; says Garg.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Chasing changing tastes</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Given the changing preferences of consumers and the varied preferences across regions, jewellers do their homework thoroughly before entering new markets. Almost all brands have dedicated teams that not just track suitable locations, measure the purchasing power of potential customers and the share of unorganised players in the market, but also speak extensively to customers about design preferences. All this groundwork is laid out months ahead of a planned launch and the brands take a decision on whether to go ahead with the launch based on these findings. &ldquo;We have a core team that has been with us for 20 years. It has a good understanding of the business and thoroughly surveys locations that we plan to enter. Unless we are confident about the market potential, we don&rsquo;t go ahead with the launch,&rdquo; says Kalyanaraman. One of the trusted methods jewellers use to gauge the potential of a location is to hold exhibitions to ascertain the audience&rsquo;s propensity to consume, and not all test locations make the cut. &ldquo;We hold three to four exhibitions a year at all test locations. We had surveyed nearly 100 locations before zeroing in on the current 55-60,&rdquo; says Hinduja.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">After understanding the profile and needs of the buyers, jewellers come up with the best possible mix of designs. &ldquo;We generally don&rsquo;t go wrong in the assessing local preferences since this is researched thoroughly. But we might commit errors in judgment in the additional stocks and designs that we offer,&rdquo; says Alukkas. According to him, since Indian consumers are strongly rooted in their local customs and traditions, it takes them a long time to open up to unconventional designs when it comes to jewellery. But he believes that things are definitely changing. &ldquo;We are seeing a shift in this regard because consumers are buying jewellery on more occasions than they conventionally used to,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">Kerala-based jewellery retailer Joyalukkas, which has 51 stores across India and 44 overseas, has chalked up Rs 1,200 crore for its expansion plan, of which Rs 600 crore will be for overseas expansion. &ldquo;We have charted out an aggressive growth plan for the next two years, which will see 20 new Joyalukkas showrooms opening across India and 10 new showrooms in other parts of the world, taking our overall count to 125,&rdquo; says Alukkas. The company&rsquo;s plan also includes entering two new markets &mdash; the US and Sri Lanka. Of course, moving out of its comfort zone and taking on competitors such as Tata Group&rsquo;s Titan and local incumbents is quite a challenge. Titan is the largest player in the branded space, with a network of 170 Tanishq stores and 33 GoldPlus outlets across the country; jewellery accounts for around 80% of the overall company sales. The plan is now to add 30 new Tanishq stores in FY15 in smaller towns through the franchisee route.</p>\n<p class="p3">While increasing competition is not something that Titan can wish away, analysts believe that there is enough room for all brands to grow as the sector transitions and takes on a more organised form. &ldquo;Given the Indian consumer&rsquo;s appetite for gold and the size of the sector, there is an opportunity for each player to create its own niche, which is what most of them are doing,&rdquo; says Gautam Duggad, vice-president, Motilal Oswal Securities. Since in newer locations the brands don&rsquo;t have the benefit of the goodwill they enjoy in their home markets, they must work on innovative promotions to make that local connect. Which is why Kalyan Jewellers chose to make regional superstars its brand ambassadors at different locations &mdash; in Tamil Nadu, it has signed on Prabhu Ganesan, son of yesteryears superstar Sivaji Ganesan and a popular actor himself; in Seemandhra, it has Nagarjuna, a leading Tollywood actor and son of late Tollywood veteran Nageswar Rao.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;We came up with the sons-of-legends campaign as a regional superstar&rsquo;s endorsement of our products reassures customers about the quality of our gold,&rdquo; says Kalyanaraman. Under the campaign, the stars act as advisors to the customers, educating them about what to watch out for when buying jewellery. For its national campaigns, the brand has signed on none other than Amitabh Bachchan and his daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai Bachchan to endorse its products. Kalyan Jewellers spends around 2% of its revenue on marketing campaigns and is looking out for alternate channels to reach out to customers as well, much like other brands. It has converted its My Kalyan service centres &mdash; initially set up to educate consumers in smaller towns and rural areas on the purity, transparency and utility of buying gold &mdash; into retail outlets that sell affordable diamonds in the #5,000 to #50,000 range. &ldquo;Consumers in rural areas have no access to diamond jewellery because jewellers there predominantly sell gold; they have to come to the city if they want to buy diamonds. So, we came up with the idea of making diamonds more accessible for them through our network of My Kalyan centres,&rdquo; says Kalyanaraman.</p>\n<p class="p3">With this move, the brand is also hoping to increase the contribution of diamonds to its overall revenue from the current 10%. Since south Indians traditionally prefer to buy plain gold jewellery, brands such as Kalyan Jewellers and Joyalukkas derive almost 90% of revenue from gold jewellery, where the margins are as low as 10-12%. TBZ, PCJ and Tanishq, which have a large presence in the north and west parts of the country, have a higher contribution of around 25-30% from diamond jewellery, where the gross margins are around 30%. Kalyan Jewellers also hopes to reach out to consumers through its online platform by 2015.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"A online presence will help us reach out to consumers at locations where we are not present" - Prem Hinduja, CEO, Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Along similar lines, PCJ has also tied up with Flipkart to sell its offerings online, apart from hosting a dedicated portal of its own. The company will introduce specialised collections in the Rs 5,000 to Rs 25,000 range, offering a 10-12% margin on diamond jewellery and 1-2% on gold jewellery to its online partner. Customers will have the option of buying jewellery online and getting it exchanged or repaired offline, ensuring a seamless buying experience for them. Garg is hopeful that the Indian online jewellery market will follow in the footsteps of China, where the online market has grown from 0.3% in 2006 to 5-6% in 2014. TBZ is also looking at having an online presence which will help the company have a national impact, says Hinduja. TBZ is also working with an e-commerce player to offer its product lines on the latter&rsquo;s platform. But while jewellers may fervently explore new channels, much of the growth over the past few years has been through new store expansion, and most expect the trend to continue. Both Alukkas and Garg expect their companies&rsquo; revenue to grow by 25% over the next two years, while Kalyanaraman is more optimistic about revenue growth, given Kalyan Jewellers&rsquo; more aggressive expansion plans; he expects revenue to grow by 50% in FY16.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Not all that glitters</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The past two years have been challenging for the jewellery industry, with consumer discretionary demand taking a hit and regulatory changes impacting growth. In May 2013, in a bid to contain the current account deficit, RBI withdrew its lease provision for gold. In the past, a jeweller could lease gold from a bullion banker for 90 days at a fixed price by paying 3-4% interest, which meant that even if the jeweller only sold half the quantity he leased in a month&rsquo;s time, he would only have to pay for the quantity sold and at the price sold. The removal of this lease meant that jewellers now had to pay up for the gold upfront, leading to a hike in working capital. &ldquo;While we always had to contend with volatility in gold prices as per demand and supply trends, the regulatory change pushed up the premium on gold prices rather significantly. So, customers started to defer purchases, and the uncertainty before the elections didn&rsquo;t help our cause either,&rdquo; says Hinduja. At its peak in December 2013, the premium on gold zoomed up to $160 per ounce, before settling down to the more acceptable $3-4 per ounce currently, once regulations were relaxed first in May and then December 2014.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In a bid to put a lid on the rising current account deficit, the central bank also introduced the 80:20 rule in August 2013, which deemed that 20% of all imported gold has to be re-exported after value addition. Not only did this lead to supply constraints and a spurt in premiums, but also gave birth to a renewed bout of smuggling. The rule was finally junked in early December this year, much to the relief of the industry, bringing down these premiums from $10-15 per ounce to $3-4 per ounce.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In addition, the new Companies Act of 2013 construed the advances collected under gold schemes as public deposits and capped returns at 12% and the total amount of deposits to 25% of net worth. Traditionally, customer deposits have been one of the major sources of funding for jewellers, rising from 8% in FY08 to 26% in FY14. Almost all jewellers not only stopped accepting fresh deposits, but also had to offer the option of redemption through jewellery purchases or switch over to new schemes. All this had an impact on their working capital and debt position &mdash; in the absence of gold-on-lease plans, Titan went from having net cash of Rs 83 crore on its balance sheet as of March 2014 to having a net debt position of Rs 730 crore as of September 2014. With regulations slowly easing up, jewellers are now hopeful that discretionary demand will improve on the back of positive sentiments, benign gold prices and the expectations that the new government will usher in a period of economic growth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>The sheen is showing- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">With an annual consumption of 850-900 tonne, India remains the second-largest consumer of gold in the world, next only to China <em>(see: The sheen is showing)</em>. According to a report by the World Gold Council, Indians spend 8% of their daily consumption on gold, after accounting for medical and educational expenses. Much of the demand is investment-led, thanks to the lack of alternate financial investment options, the freedom to invest small amounts and the returns the metal has generated over the past decade, and this is not likely to change anytime soon. Jewellers are betting on this notion and the improving economic sentiment in the country to drive demand and are looking to take market share away from unorganised players as they expand their footprint, starting from regions they already have a strong presence in.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But given that gold is not only an integral part of any big, fat Indian wedding and festivals but also one of the main avenues for savings and investment, jewellers are quite confident of sustaining their growth momentum. &ldquo;Indians love jewellery. Ever since Sita dropped her bangles on the way to Lanka in order to guide Rama in his search for her, the metal has been an integral part of every Indian household. While there may be short-term blips in demand or regulatory constraints, we are confident that in the long term, gold will continue to be the preferred asset class,&rdquo; says a confident Kalyanaraman.&nbsp;</p>', 'Regional Jewellers are venturing outside their traditional strongholds to make the most of the gold rush', '6', '', 0, '', 'golds-own-country-206', 201, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Gold''s own country', 'Regional Jewellers are venturing outside their traditional strongholds to make the most of the gold rush', '', '', '', 'Kalyan Jewellers,Warburg Pincus,Joyalukkas,TBZ,PCJ', 0, NULL, '2015-01-22 15:02:59', '2015-01-22 16:09:40', '2015-01-23', 0);

(207, 16, '', 'Down the country road', '<p class="p1">In the summer of 2010, out on a stroll in the grassy meadows of a village on the outskirts of Kolkata, all that 36-year-old Mohan Goenka, director of leading FMCG brand Emami limited, could see around him were narrow roads branching off in different directions, snaking past paddy fields to connect village homes with the bustling main road. Trucks stuffed with poultry and carbonated drinks alike trundled down this road, with tempos, buses and other city vehicles for company. The dimly-lit retail stores offering an eclectic mix of products with equally enthusiastic shopkeepers. Goenka realised that this far-from-pastoral scene perhaps had more space and sales opportunities to offer his company than most big cities and convinced Emami&rsquo;s senior management about venturing deep into the hinterland. Thus was born Project Swadesh, an initiative with the express intention of improving the company&rsquo;s existing coverage of rural markets. &ldquo;We catered to the masses anyway, so we thought that this would be a good strategic decision. In 2010, at the time of the launch of the programme, the contribution of rural markets to overall sales volumes was approximately 17%. This figure has now risen to almost 45-50%,&rdquo; says Goenka.</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>"Today rural markets contribute 45% to sales, upfrom 17% in 2010 when Project Swadesh was launched" - Mohan Goenka, director, Emami</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">A rise in sales volumes was just one of the outcomes Emami was betting on while undertaking its risky rural sojourn &mdash; with this outreach programme of sorts, the company was also hoping to grab the untapped potential of rural markets. Using tried and tested methods such as extending rural distribution through the super-stockist and sub-stockist models, increasing coverage using van operations and reducing dependence on wholesale or indirect distribution of its products, Emami slowly built its presence in rural markets. In its first year, the project was rolled out in Uttar Pradesh, erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and West Bengal, which together account for 55% of the total population of India. Later, the project was extended to Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Haryana, Punjab and Gujarat. Independent field forces were also deployed in phases for the execution and close monitoring of the programme. This is probably why the reported direct outlet coverage of the brand went from around 4 lakh in 2010 to 6.34 lakh in FY14, with an indirect reach of 3.4 million retailers. &ldquo;We used Emami&rsquo;s vast mass products basket, which includes low-priced cooling oils, creams, talcum powder, balm and lotions, to aid our rural strategy,&rdquo; Goenka adds. Its vibrant product basket is also what sets apart the Kolkata-headquartered company from its well-entrenched competitors. Set up in the 1970s by RS Agarwal and RS Goenka with a seed capital of Rs 20,000, Emami today operates out of the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass in Kolkata. Thanks to its inventive rural strategy, the company has been able to directly connect to hundreds of 10,000-people-strong villages. On a sunny October afternoon, as Emami&rsquo;s HQ is abuzz with the lunch-hour rush, Harsha Vardhan Agarwal, the 37-year-old director of the company and the younger son of founder and executive chairman RS Agarwal, seems more than eager to share insights into the rural blitzkrieg. &ldquo;Our strategy is simple &mdash; sustainable sales success combined with a wide footprint. We are now delivering new products to stores quickly.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>A fair share - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The company is also backing up its rural reach with an equally aggressive product pricing strategy. Agarwal picks up a sachet from the dizzying array of cosmetics around the room and carefully places it on a table. &ldquo;This packet of our well-known brand Navratna Cool oil is priced at just Re 1. Pricing is proving to be key for us, as it has helped us capture unaddressed markets. Thanks to the efforts of our distribution network, sachet sales now account for 29% of Navratna&rsquo;s overall revenue,&rdquo; he quips. Maker of brands such as Boroplus, Fair and Handsome and Zandu Balm, Emami has withstood the test of time, altering its offerings in step with the rapidly changing demographics of its hometown. The company is now redefining its identity, refurbishing operations and restructuring its workforce to give itself a much-needed upgrade and make itself more relevant to a price- and variety-conscious population.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Hinterland hopes</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">With India&rsquo;s FMCG sector expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.7% to $110 billion by 2020, Emami has been on the lookout for segments to power future growth, before finally zeroing in on a plan to enhance penetration in rural and urban India. While it hopes to capitalise on urban growth to make its products more accessible to customers, the company is keen on a strong rural distribution network that gives it direct access to retailers in villages. Emami plans to launch several profitable product extensions to build on this growth, with brands such as Zandu Vigorex, Emami 7 Oils in One, Boroplus Face Wash and Fair and Handsome Face Wash for men being launched in the last year alone. But at the heart of all these plans is one simple, compelling success story &mdash; a strong distribution network, both direct and indirect.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Sitting pretty- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">And Project Swadesh perhaps deserves credit as Emami&rsquo;s biggest distribution success in recent years, with the company coming up with novel ways to push its products in the rural sphere. &ldquo;Events such as village fairs and <em>yatras</em>, where people gather in huge numbers for a common cause, offer us a great opportunity to connect with our target audience,&rdquo; says Agarwal. Which is why an integral part of Emami&rsquo;s rural marketing strategy was brand-related activities at popular <em>melas</em> and fairs, such as the Sonepur <em>mela</em>, Sawan <em>mela</em>, Kanlinga <em>yatra</em> and the Kumbh <em>mela</em>. &ldquo;The below-the-line activities undertaken at these <em>melas</em> and <em>haats</em> helped us create a strong brand presence, in turn helping us improve rural penetration and awareness,&rdquo; he adds. The company&rsquo;s enhanced presence in modern trade also helped it consolidate its urban and rural reach and ensured direct access to consumers. &ldquo;We conducted various trade meets to enhance engagements with trade partners and implemented IT initiatives at the dealer level, improving secondary sales visibility,&rdquo; says Naresh Bhansali, CEO, finance, strategy and business development, Emami.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Village fairs and <em>yatras</em> offer us a great opportunity to connect with our target audience" - Harsha Vardhan Agarwal, promoter director, Emami</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Emami also increased the implementation of its distributor billing software to around 1,000 distributors. &ldquo;While the basic structure of our FMCG distribution system is similar to our peers, the difference lies in the execution, in which Emami excels,&rdquo; says Agarwal. He explains that Emami&rsquo;s sales team is building capability to drive sales efficiency, improve in-store and in-market impact and build information systems. According to its management, the company has invested considerably in manpower &mdash; both direct and indirect &mdash; over the past two years to spearhead the distribution mechanism. In the consumer care division alone, direct manpower deployment has increased by more than 10% over the past two years and the increase in indirect manpower is projected to grow by more than 25% by 2014-15. An exclusive rural sales team featuring everyone from managers to front-liners has also been deployed to ensure exclusive focus on rural distribution. Besides these measures, there has also been an increased emphasis on improving visibility and ensuring focused execution, resulting in increased direct outlet coverage by 64,000 outlets in FY14. Sales growth during this period was nearly 17% on a five-year CAGR basis.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We implememted IT initiatives at the dealer level, thus, improving secondary sales visibility" - Naresh Bhansali, CEO, CFO, finance, strategy and business development, Emami&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The company also plans to create a strong network of viable distributors and a highly motivated sales team with a hunger to achieve bigger targets, using modern trade as a growth engine to project its product range and information systems and technology to drive efficiency. Plans are afoot to extend Project Swadesh to Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana, Tamil Nadu and Odisha in the second phase and improve distribution and range further in existing rural markets. According to Agarwal, the company plans to increase direct sales by 15-20% every year and invest significantly in IT systems for the overall distribution system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Small is beautiful</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Emami&rsquo;s key to increased penetration in the rural markets lies in its low-priced packs in the mass category. &ldquo;Emami is leveraging its low-unit pack portfolio to drive penetration of its products in rural and semi-urban areas. Nearly 30% of its turnover currently comes from stock-keeping units (SKUs) priced below Rs 5,&rdquo; says a Mumbai-based analyst on condition of anonymity. The company currently offers Rs 2 SKUs of Zandu Balm and Mentho Plus, Re 1 sachets of Navratna oil (which accounts for 40% of brand sales), Rs 10 SKUs of Fair and Handsome and Rs 5 SKUs of Vasocare petroleum jelly and Boroplus in order to drive penetration and usage in rural markets. Going forward, Emami aspires to improve the outlet coverage by adding new outlets in urban markets as well. Newer launches such as HE deodorant and She Comfort &mdash; sanitary pads &mdash; have given the brand access to new stores as well. It&rsquo;s not just reaching out to retailers in the hinterland that Emami is banking on for growth, consumer feedback is a big takeaway. &ldquo;Insights gathered from our visits to rural market led to our foray into cooling talcum powder. For villagers only fragrance was not enough of an attribute. Increasingly, they were in need of something which kept their body cool in extreme summer. That&rsquo;s how our development team created the Navratna Cool Talc. For us, Project Swadesh is also an important feedback mechanism,&rdquo; points out Goenka.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Up, close and personal - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Today, Emami&rsquo;s distribution pipeline comprises of more than 3,000 distributors and 6,450 sub-distributors, and the company covers the entire country through its 28 depots. &ldquo;This pipeline makes it possible for Emami to distribute its products wider, quicker and at an efficient cost to retail shelves,&rdquo; says Agarwal. While Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Seemandhra, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh are among the most prominent rural markets for Emami, Navratna oil and Boroplus are the products that are most popular. &ldquo;Zandu Balm and Mentho Plus also see high rural sales in states such as Seemandhra and Maharashtra,&rdquo; says Goenka. Apart from popular brands such as Navratna, Boroplus, Zandu Balm and Mentho Plus, the company has also seen traction in other products such as Fair and Handsome and Vasocare in rural markets over the past few years, he adds. Large distributors, too, are upbeat about the change in strategy. &ldquo;The coverage of Emami products has improved significantly &mdash; contribution of all SKUs increased; contribution of retail sales increased to 70% from 50% earlier, while wholesale has come down to 30% from 40%,&rdquo; says Umang Jain of Delhi-based Arihant Enterprises, which supplies to 41 wholesalers and 1170 retailers around east Delhi.</p>\n<p class="p3">While propping up its distribution strategy, the company has also ensured that its advertising and promotion (A&amp;P) strategy remains as aggressive as ever. &ldquo;Though the advertising and promotion (A&amp;P) to sales ratio has declined over the past four years, at over 16%, it is still one of the highest among its FMCG peers, which have largely maintained sub-15% A&amp;P-to-sales ratios. The company&rsquo;s advertisement campaigns are in keeping with its mass market focus,&rdquo; says a Motilal Oswal research report. Industry experts believe that Emami also has a long roster of celebrities endorsing its brands and that makes a big difference, especially in rural households. HK Press, an independent consumer consultant and former vice-chairman of Godrej Consumer Products, says, &ldquo;Emami has an interesting assortment of products and the company keeps innovating on the same, roping in celebrities to appeal to the vast section of the population it is targeting.&rdquo; Celebrities from diverse fields &mdash; from Amitabh Bachchan, Madhuri Dixit and Hrithik Roshan to Milkha Singh and Gautam Gambhir to name a few &mdash; endorse the brand&rsquo;s products on-air. &ldquo;The celebrity appeal creates aspirational values and widens the intended target audience group for our niche products,&rdquo; feels Agarwal.

(209, 20, '', 'Can India Inc raise Rs 7 lakh cr to save itself?', '<p class="p1">At a time when the global economy is iffy and the market precarious enough to make debt, restructuring, interest rates and rate cuts a part of popular lexicon, stressed assets account for the biggest damage to the Indian banking system; currently, they comprise close to 10% of total lending.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Stressed assets refer to loans that have already been tagged as non-performing-assets (NPAs) or have been restructured by banks. With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)&rsquo;s push for greater transparency and early identification of such problem loans, the amount of loans that may be formally tagged as stressed could increase by a couple of percentage points in the near future. Of course, certain banks fare far worse than others, given that stressed assets as a percentage of their total lending book have already reached mid-teen levels. Such double-digit stressed asset rates were last seen in the 1990s; for the most part, between 2000 and 2010, the systemic NPA rate remained well below 2%. While the economy has been performing well during the past decade, banks have also earned appreciation for improving their credit underwriting standards and risk-management practises. In fact, there was a prevalent belief that double-digit systemic stress rates were a thing of the previous century. However, those expectations went down the drain when the economy tanked. Given that the true test of a risk-management system is how well it manages a downturn, the current systemic NPA raises some ugly questions about the same.</p>\n<p class="p2">As we stand today, corporate leverage in India is at a decade high. Banks, which are already reeling under credit pressure, may not be willing to provide additional debt to companies that make up the core economy sectors, thereby hindering the revival of the overall economy. For any broad-based revival of the economy, it is critical that major corporates in sectors such as infrastructure, construction, metals and mining have sufficient balance sheet strength to fund the next round of growth (<em>see: In dire straits</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>In dire straits- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Unfortunately, most corporates in these sectors do not have the strength required to tap growth opportunities; an immediate solution would then be to reduce, at least moderately, the leverage levels of these companies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">As per a recent India Ratings &amp; Research study, 262 of the country&rsquo;s 500 largest corporate borrowers would require an equity infusion of a whopping Rs 7 lakh crore ($114 billion) for this purpose. One could always wait for the economy to turn around and the operating performance of these corporates to improve, but according to the study, it would take five to six years for leverage to lessen through such an organic route. If there are any domestic or external shocks during this timeframe, these corporates could then slip into the stressed category; in addition, these corporates would then have limited access to debt funding during this period and would likely exhibit below-par growth. So, how did this issue careen to such monstrous proportions and what is the way out for both corporates and banks?</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>Road to perdition</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">Credit problems of this stature do not occur overnight. A significant number of players in this credit bust ascribe reasons such as policy paralysis for their problems. While policy paralysis and global uncertainty may have had definite roles to play in this mess, fixing the entire blame only on these factors externalises the problem. The implication of these excuses is that the entire credit infrastructure &mdash; an all-encompassing term used to describe borrowers, lenders, independent third parties as well as the legal and regulatory framework &mdash; had no significant shortcomings. However, as RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has himself taken great pains to point out in the past, more than one constituent of the domestic credit infrastructure requires rethinking. It may be argued that the seeds of the current credit bust were sown in FY10-FY11, when, ironically, Indian growth was recovering post the global financial crisis. But before one gets there, it may be worthwhile to study corporate growth and debt growth dynamics for the past decade.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Living with debt- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">During the 2004-2008 period, leading up to September 2008, the infamous Lehman moment, debt on the balance sheets of the 500 largest corporate borrowers grew in tandem with their Ebitda growth, while the median leverage remained within a healthy range of 2.3 to 2.5. [Here, leverage is measured as net debt of the corporate, divided by the Ebitda.] The systemic NPA rates at this time were at historic lows of around 1%. However, even during this boom phase, the cracks in risk management of both Indian banks as well as corporates were amply visible to all &mdash; some Indian corporates had paid heavily for their ill-considered dalliances with foreign currency derivatives, while other prominent names in the Indian corporate fraternity were close to defaulting or had already defaulted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">In addition, the real estate market had already been tagged off as overheated, with a flurry of defaults by well-established companies. During each of these domestic mini-crises, corporates and their lenders pinned the blame on each other, though the jury is still out on who was the culprit.</p>\n<p class="p2">From September 2008 to the climax of the sub-prime crisis in October 2009, banks severely curtailed credit availability. Thus, balance sheet debt of corporates, which was then growing at 25% to 40% on a year-on-year basis, met a roadblock. Given the uncertain environment back then, Ebitda growth nosedived to around 10% from the 25-40% growth seen in the previous four years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">There was a flurry of defaults, mostly from corporates with huge unhedged foreign currency exposure or those whose businesses were linked to global trade channels. Though corporate leverage continued to deteriorate, the situation was still not as worrisome. To the credit of the government and RBI governor back then, significant steps were taken to shield the Indian economy, with the former cutting loose fiscal strings to push up the GDP component of community, social and personal services (CSPS). This component shot up by 36% (y-o-y, current prices) for Q3FY09. In the following four out of five quarters, this component grew at 20%+ rates.</p>\n<p class="p2">But FY10 and FY11 were the real inflection points in the economy in more ways than one. India returned to an 8%+ GDP growth trajectory, with a minor hiccup in FY08. Market observers and laymen all focused on these two years to draw the grand conclusion that India was a purely domestic growth story far removed from what happened in the rest of the world. Few, if any, focused on the fact that the FY04-FY08 period was unique in the global economic scenario. As such, global GDP growth of close to 4% for four to five years in a row &mdash; as in the case between 2004 and 2007 &mdash; empirically occurs only once every two decades; the last such high-plateau global GDP growth rate occurred between 1984 and 1989. What was unique about the 2004-07 global growth was that apart from the US and the BRIC nations, over 40 countries had exhibited peak growth rates during this period. However, this correlation of Indian growth with the global scenario was generally overlooked by a significant number of financial decision-makers.</p>\n<p class="p2">The surge in corporate profitability between FY10 and FY11 was largely attributed to the leadership brilliance of India Inc. While this may be true, limited references were made to the Kalecki Profit Equation, as per which the drivers of an economy-wide increase in corporate profitability are creations of investment assets in the economy, dis-saving by households and incremental fiscal deficits by the government. Given that the government had to tackle a surging fiscal deficit since FY10, putting a stop to its spending, households also stopped splurging and corporate profitability started to nosedive post FY11.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>From boom to bust- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Nonetheless, bolstered by the self-belief that the banking system&rsquo;s credit started flowing back from November 2009, corporate Ebitda growth rate did crawl back to above 20% in FY10 and FY11 from the lows of FY09, while leverage remained at elevated levels of 3 and above. With the benefit of hindsight, one may say that the misconceptions and excesses during this period were among the possible contributors to the current credit bust. By March 2012, however, the intensity of negative news flows and on-ground developments had vitiated the business environment. Scams, policy logjams and rupee depreciation followed Murphy&rsquo;s Law with precision, the cumulative outcome being that the median leverage levels of top Indian borrowers have touched 5. Currently, nearly one in three corporates barely earn enough to service even their interest obligations (<em>see: From boom to bust</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong><em>Achche din</em> ahead?</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">The positive developments of the last six months, then, have brought about a revival of hope, the key driver of which is a majority government at the Centre, led by an eloquent leader who has a track record of successful governance in his previous roles. While the central government can provide a stable business environment and policy framework, at the end of the day, corporates are required to conduct the actual on-ground activities, and these activities require funding; that&rsquo;s precisely the biggest challenge for reviving growth in India. A lot of currently overleveraged corporates have banked on debt for growth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Playing it safe- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">This had been relatively easy back in FY10-FY11, with bankers buying into the theory that Indian growth was decoupled from the rest of the world. However, they possibly forgot that economic downturns still exist and thus, ended up underwriting long-terms loans with an assumption of an 8% year-on-year GDP growth rate till judgement day. Consequently, then, bankers&rsquo; appetite for fresh loans to overleveraged corporates is currently low (<em>see: Playing it safe</em>). This is classic pro-cyclical behaviour by the banking system, where excess credit deployment in boom time is followed by excessive risk-aversion accompanied by loan sanctions during downturns. Thus, what corporates truly need today is to bolster their balance sheets by infusing good old-fashioned common equity.</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>About time now&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">The urgency of equity capital requirement is the highest for 63 corporates that have either been tagged as NPAs or are undergoing distressed debt restructuring processes (s<em>ee: The downtrodden</em>). These corporates require #2.4 trillion as equity over the next six to 12 months so that they can remain actively functional as corporates. However, the equity required by most of these corporates is on an average five times their market capitalisation. To raise even a portion of this required equity, the current promoters would, in all likelihood, have to cede control of the company or sell it off altogether. There is a high likelihood that many of these corporates will not be able to raise the required amount of equity, continuing to languish on the balance sheets<br /> of the Indian financial system for five to 10 years before being<br /> finally liquidated.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>The downtrodden- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Among the 262 corporates on the waiting list for an equity infusion, 128 boast of leverage higher than their historical average, but with their business profile and reputation intact. These corporates need equity capital to fund their next round of growth, but, not surprisingly, the equity required to be raised is well below a lot of their market capitalisations. Of course, in at least some of these cases, the promoter holding post issuance of equity may fall below 26%. In these cases, more than anything else, the reluctance of some of the promoters to cede control may be the biggest roadblock in raising equity. The next round of the investment-asset creation cycle, which is widely expected to bring the economy back on track, is clearly contingent on these 262 behemoths of corporate India being able to infuse equity into their balance sheets. Any reduction in the interest rate will give some breathing space to these overleveraged corporates; however, in the absence of significant equity infusion, a revival of future investment cycle is somewhat overoptimistic.</p>\n<p class="p2">However, all is not lost. During the period of credit excess, close to 180 large corporates zealously guarded their balance sheets against debt excesses and currently do not have any urgent need of equity capital; their leverage continues to remain healthy. These corporates should be able to access the capital of their choice without too many constraints. In fact, the financial flexibility that they enjoy gives them a competitive advantage over their highly leveraged industry peers. It is some of these companies, then, who will be the flagbearers of the next round of growth. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7"><strong>The author is senior director, India Ratings &amp; Research (Fitch Group).&nbsp;Views expressed by him are personal</strong></p>', 'Over 260 of the country''s 500 largest corporate borrowers need a massive round of equity infusion to deleverage.

(210, 20, '', 'All set for the big leap', '<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whil</span>e tyres may feature quite low down the totem pole of interesting and engaging manufacturing businesses, Balkrishna Industries has done enough to make Dalal Street sit up and take notice. Founded in 1961, Balkrishna ventured into the off-highway tyre (OHT) market in 1995 and today boasts of a product range featuring more than 2,000 tyre varieties, with a presence in over 130 countries. Accounting for around 10% of the overall tyre industry, the global OHT market is valued at around $9 billion and Balkrishna gets 90% of its revenue from exports (<em>see: Continent hopper</em>). That investors are solidly sold on Balkrishna&rsquo;s growth story can be seen from its skyrocketing share price, which has increased at a 77% CAGR over FY09-FY14, compared with an 18% growth in the Sensex over the same period. Over the past year, the stock price nearly tripled to Rs 840 from Rs 285 before correcting recently to Rs 600 on the back of Q2FY15 results, which fell short of analyst expectations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Continent hopper- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">With the expected commissioning of Balkrishna&rsquo;s new facility in Bhuj by the end of FY16, the company will continue to hold on to its status of India&rsquo;s premier player in the niche OHT segment, that is, tyres for off-road usage in agricultural, construction and forestry equipment, etc. However, it is important to remember that the company&rsquo;s growth will be tempered by the vagaries of the global economy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>Early bird</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">Balkrishna undoubtedly has the first-mover advantage in the domestic OHT space. The company also has a sturdy competitive moat against encroachment by other leading Indian tyre manufacturers such as Apollo Tyres, MRF and Ceat, as its business model is primarily based on low volume and high variety. The task of maintaining Balkrishna&rsquo;s capex-intensive range of 2,000 varieties of tyres acts as a natural entry barrier for domestic competition, helped along by the fact that it is quite difficult for other companies to convert idle radial tyre capacity for OHT use. &ldquo;This is particularly difficult for domestic conventional tyre makers, who are accustomed to high volumes of standardised passenger car and commercial vehicle tyres,&rdquo; says an Ambit Capital report authored by Ashvin Shetty and Ritu Modi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">The only major competition Balkrishna faces in India is from the Alliance Tire Group (ATG), founded by the Mahansaria family, which also co-founded Balkrishna and is related by marriage to Balkrishna&rsquo;s promoters, the Poddar family. ATG has witnessed meteoric growth so far and draws revenue comparable with Balkrishna&rsquo;s Rs 3,500 crore. In one of the largest PE deals in India, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) Equity acquired a controlling stake in ATG in April 2013 for a reported figure of $450 million. With such influential backers, there can hardly be any doubt about ATG&rsquo;s growth trajectory, enough to etch furrows in the foreheads of Balkrishna&rsquo;s promoters. But analysts are of the opinion that there is enough space to grow, considering Indian players hold less than 10% of the global market in spite of a strong cost advantage.</p>\n<p class="p2">Balkrishna also enjoys other advantages because of its business model. Surjit Arora, analyst with Prabhudas Lilladher, says, &ldquo;Balkrishna enjoys zero import duties on rubber because of the export orientation of its business. Hence, compared with other domestic tyre companies, which mostly manufacture for domestic use, its margins are much higher. Also, Indian manufacturers are split between passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles and OHT, of which OHT makes up just 6-7% of their revenue. So, given that the commercial vehicle segment is expected to grow at a heady pace there is no reason for other manufacturers to shift to OHT, reducing competitive threat for Balkrishna.&rdquo; In addition, the company pays zero excise duty on its exports, further boosting its margins.</p>\n<p class="p2">Given all these factors, there is the possibility of Balkrishna gaining from an expansion in the domestic OHT industry. While the OHT segment in India is miniscule today at around 10% of the entire tyre market, an AT Kearney report says the earthmoving and construction equipment industry is estimated to more than double from $3 billion in 2012 to $7-8 billion in 2016, following the widely expected uptick in capital expenditure in India. And thanks to rising rural wages and the need to enhance productivity, agriculture might also slowly shift to mechanised farming to feed a growing population. As Balkrishna derives almost two-thirds of its revenue from agriculture equipment, catering to the highly mechanised farms in Europe and America, the management expects agricultural demand to boost the company&rsquo;s revenues in the coming quarters once the American winter is over. It helps that the need for variety inherent in the OHT business discourages competition from Chinese manufacturers. &ldquo;The Chinese advantage comes from mass production of standardised products. The high variety, low volume nature of OHT has prevented Chinese companies from becoming dominant players in the business,&rdquo; notes the earlier mentioned Ambit report.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Another major advantage Balkrishna has over global competitors such as Bridgestone, Michelin and Titan International is the availability of low-cost manufacturing facilities in India compared with the geographies &mdash; Europe and America &mdash; the multinational giants operate in. Balkrishna&rsquo;s employee costs work out to a meagre 5-6% of its sales, significantly lower than Michelin, which spends around a quarter of its sales revenue on employee costs (<em>see: Cost warrior</em>). &ldquo;Despite selling at a 30% discount to the industry leader, Balkrishna enjoys strong margins as its products are competitive due to lower labour costs in India, compared with significantly higher wage and benefits/entitlement structures present at European facilities,&rdquo; says an ICICI Securities report authored by Nishant Vass.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Cost warrior- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Balkrishna holds only 4.5% of the global market share, which means it has plenty of room to expand. Balkrishna presently has plants at Aurangabad in Maharashtra and at Bhiwadi and Chopanki in Rajasthan. Once the fourth plant at Bhuj is fully commissioned, it is expected to double Balkrishna&rsquo;s capacity to 300,000 metric tonne from 156,000 metric tonne in FY12. The proximity of the plant to various ports on the Gujarat coast will also bring down transportation costs. The Bhuj plant is also expected to expand capacity in the non-agricultural off-the-road (OTR) tyre segment, that is, the construction and mining tyre space, which constitutes two-thirds of the global OHT market. Restricted by capacity constraints, Balkrishna holds less than 2% market share in this segment and derived only 33% of its revenue from it in FY14. The Bhuj plant, which will focus on manufacturing large-diametre tyres catering to the OTR segment, should help rectify this.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>Sweet spot</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">This expansion comes at an appropriate time for Balkrishna, given that an uptick in demand in the OHT segment is foreseen in India, and the company&rsquo;s global peers are turning away from this segment. &ldquo;While global giants such as Michelin, Bridgestone, Pirelli and Trelleborg dominate the OHT industry, the contribution from OHT to their overall revenue is just about 10-12%. While margins are high in the OHT space, the segment faces its own set of challenges in the form of high degree of customisation, relatively high labour costs (particularly in developed economies) and relatively higher capital requirements,&rdquo; notes the Ambit report. Between FY09 and FY14, Balkrishna&rsquo;s revenue has grown at a CAGR of 24%, compared with the 6% growth in Michelin&rsquo;s OHT revenue and the 2% increase in Trelleborg&rsquo;s OHT sales, indicating a rise in market share. Balkrishna is also set to gain from expansion into newer geographies such as Russia, CIS countries and Latin America, aided by capacity addition in the OTR segment from the Bhuj plant. As of FY14, Balkrishna derives 53% of its sales volume from Europe, 19% from America, 11% from India, 6% from the rest of Asia and 12% from New Zealand, Australia, West Asia and Africa combined.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Latent potential- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">According to Modern Tire Dealer, in the US market, Balkrishna holds nearly 20% market share in the radial rear farm tyre replacement segment and 40% in the bias rear farm replacement tyre segment, which indicates growing customer acceptance of the brand. A report by Dolat Capital also corroborates this observation: &ldquo;We expect the replacement market to continue to be the growth driver as it is a relatively higher margin business, compared to the OEMs. Our assumption is supported by the fact that globally, the OEM business is witnessing some turbulent times, thereby giving a fillip to replacement demand. With its focus on replacement markets, and with new capacity coming on stream, Balkrishna is well placed to cater to this demand with faster execution, thereby gaining market share.&rdquo; According to industry sources, margins in the replacement tyre business are typically twice that for OEMs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Incidentally, the share of OEMs in Balkrishna&rsquo;s business has increased in FY14, supplying 19% of the company&rsquo;s volumes as compared with 14% in FY13. The company highlighted this fact and identified known brands such as JCB, Greaves and Ferrari as customers in its 2014 investor presentation. &ldquo;It is important for the company to make inroads into the OEM market even if it happens to be a low-margin business. If they have a good product, this market will help get replacement orders; that&rsquo;s how a company builds its profile. Also, if a company&rsquo;s tyre is visible on a reputed OEM&rsquo;s equipment, it helps build its brand internationally,&rdquo; explains Arora. As the company management expects the share of OEMs revenue to increase to 30% in the next three to four years, there could be some visible margin compression.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>Mark to market</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">Given that rubber constituted 48% of Balkrishna&rsquo;s raw material costs in FY14, the global fall in rubber prices, which have declined from an average price of Rs 208 per kg in FY12 to an average of Rs 166 per kg in 2014, has helped the company achieve tremendous margin expansion. Operating margin has increased from 16% in Q4FY12 to 18% in Q2FY15 in sync with global rubber prices. Hence, one of the key threats the company faces is a possible upswing in rubber prices, which could severely affect its operating margin. &ldquo;The main reason behind the rise in Balkrishna&rsquo;s stock price during the last year is that rubber prices have fallen sharply. To understand the trend, you need to look at all the tyre companies &ndash; Apollo, CEAT, JK and MRF &ndash; in tandem; all of them have gone up strongly. Of the rise in Balkrishna&rsquo;s share price, 70-80% was contributed by the fall in rubber prices,&rdquo; says Arora. However, this fall in price has not been passed on to consumers yet, which has enabled most tyre companies, including Balkrishna, to command hefty margins. Hence, a surge in rubber prices could mean a correction for Balkrishna, whose fortunes have so far moved with rubber prices. (<em>see: Moving in sync</em>) There is a ray of hope, though, as rubber prices are expected to remain benign for the next couple of quarters. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see rubber prices rising for the next six months or so. Global supply from Indonesia and Malaysia is improving, while demand hasn&rsquo;t picked up because of slow growth in India and China. At the same time, the leather industry is not doing well,&rdquo; says Arora. Another potential threat is rupee depreciation as most of its long-term debt is dollar denominated, in the form of external commercial borrowings used to fund the Bhuj plant. As of September 2014, the company had long-term borrowings of #1,338 crore. However, Balkrishna&rsquo;s forex exposure is naturally hedged as it imports most of its raw material. Other risks include an increase in labour costs, which would take away Balkrishna&rsquo;s key advantage of a low-cost manufacturing centre, and the slim possibility of duties imposed in the European Union.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Moving in sync- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">However, muted global demand has taken its toll on Balkrishna&rsquo;s top line in Q2FY15, which fell short of analyst expectations, leading to a sharp 26% re-rating of the stock from Rs 838 to Rs 618. In addition, competitors have started taking price cuts, an indicator that demand will remain sluggish in the next couple of quarters. Balkrishna reported a growth of 5% in its top line at Rs 880 crore despite a higher than expected 12.5% volume growth. This was mainly led by a 6.7% year-on-year decline in net realisation. Also, the management has lowered its volume guidance from 160,000 metric tonne to 155,000 metric tonne due to discouraging demand and price cuts by competitors. &ldquo;The outlook in the mining sector isn&rsquo;t very good. China and Europe are slowing down and the mining industry can&rsquo;t pick up unless the overall economy picks up, given the extensive capital expenditure required. Hence, there are no new orders. Also, the replacement cycle is getting elongated since usage has come down. In my opinion, this situation will continue for the next six months or so if we look at mining and construction equipment as a lead indicator,&rdquo; says Arora.</p>\n<p class="p2">The six months estimated by Arora could also be the time the stock takes to stabilise from the current pounding. In spite of intermittent setbacks due to its exposure to the global economy, Balkrishna remains a good play with a competent management focused on a niche segment, unlike its global peers who are spreading themselves too thin. It is positioned to take advantage of the impending revival of the Indian industry and increase its share in the global market due to its huge cost advantage and understanding of OHT demand.&nbsp;</p>', 'How Balkrishna Industries is revving up to take the global off-highway tyre market by storm and why it makes for a good bet', '14', '', 0, '', 'all-set-for-the-big-leap-210', 205, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'All set for the big leap', 'How Balkrishna Industries is revving up to take the global off-highway tyre market by storm and why it makes for a good bet', '', '', '', 'Balkrishna Industries,Off-highway tyres,Apollo Tyres,MRF,Ceat', 0, NULL, '2015-01-22 17:37:38', '2015-01-22 17:53:06', '2015-01-23', 0),

As he strikes a pose for the camera, Vishwarupe Narain, country head, TPG Growth, can&rsquo;t help but play a <em>raag</em> that complements the serenity of the view from his Nepean Sea Road flat in south Mumbai. &ldquo;I was initiated into classical music at the age of eight by my father, who played the sitar as well. After training for six years at the Doon School, I trained for seven years in Delhi under the tutelage of Shujaat Khan, son of the great sitar maestro Ustad Vilayat Khan,&rdquo; says Narain, who joined TPG in 2007 from Bessemer Venture Partners, New York.</p>\n<p class="p3">Forty-year-old Narain has been fortunate to accompany and learn from some of the stalwarts of Indian classical music. As a teenager, he won a Gurukul scholarship under which he spent a month with Pandit Balaram Pathak in Delhi. As the national coordinator for the Society For The Promotion of Indian Classical Music and Culture Amongst Youth (Spicmacay), he organised concerts across educational institutes in Delhi, where he interacted with Ustad Bismillah Khan, Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, Pandit Shivkumar Sharma and Ustad Zakir Hussain. While Narain no longer organises events at Spicmacay, he contributes to funds and attends a few concerts held in the city.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The PE veteran has presided over nearly seven deals at TPG, with the most recent one being the #150-crore investment in Bengaluru-based Sutures India last September.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While evaluating the potential of an investment, Narain finds that sometimes the answers lie not in the excel sheets but in the melody of the sitar. &ldquo;At times, the solution comes to me while playing the sitar, even though I&rsquo;m not thinking about it,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Making time for his hobby is not that simple, though, Narain admits. &ldquo;I make it a point to practise twice during the week for a couple of hours in the morning. When I retreat into my classical music pursuits, I realise that there is life beyond climbing the corporate ladder.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Talking about his routine, he says, &ldquo;I always start by playing <em>raag</em> Yaman, a foundational <em>raag</em> that has all the seven notes and can be quite complex.

(213, 24, '', 'So, what do you see?', '<p class="p1">There is always another side to every story and author Malcolm Gladwell seems to have a penchant for taking long-standing notions and turning them upside down to infuse a new perception into the same story. In his latest book <em>David and Goliath</em>, Gladwell has established that underdogs often win by playing to the weakness of their opponents as much as they win by playing to their own strengths. We all know the biblical story of David versus Goliath where David, a shepherd, defeated Goliath, a giant warrior, using a sling. Gladwell infuses a sense of pragmatism by highlighting how Goliath&rsquo;s size impaired his movement and his sight and made him a sitting duck when it came to competing with slingers. When David challenged Goliath for a single combat without a sword, Goliath became vulnerable. Like Gladwell explains, Goliath had as much a chance against David as a man with a sword would have had against someone with a .45 automatic colt pistol.</p>\n<p class="p3">The book is a refreshing take on how we decipher situations based on past experiences. It impresses upon us the lesson that even the strongest among us can be vulnerable from a different perspective. Very often, something that appears to be unmountable can easily tumble down if the rules are in favour of flexibility and efficiency. Having witnessed companies create their own space despite competition from behemoths, one can&rsquo;t help but admire the logic the book puts forward.</p>\n<p class="p3">Gladwell also draws parallels from various timelines. The book is full of anecdotes, which makes it a good read. An example that caught my attention was billionaire Vivek Randive&rsquo;s full-court press strategy, which he used to coach his daughter&rsquo;s basketball team, and the sections pointing out how low students-teacher ratios lead to an unimaginative environment in classrooms. In addition, it contains anecdotes of TE Lawrence (of Lawrence of Arabia fame) leading his ragtag army against the mighty Turks in Medina by attacking them from a different side and the innovative spirit of IKEA, whose founder, Ingvar Kemprad, established a cost-efficient business model when faced with a boycott. Snippets like these make it interesting to breeze through the book.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;Although some of us may not agree with Gladwell&rsquo;s pop psychology, his arguments about how dyslexic people are more successful because of their condition and his logic regarding Le Chambon, a French village that supposedly defied the Nazis, seem farfetched and lack relevance to the central premise of the book. However, the one thing that I admire about the book is the perception that every underdog is actually not one and that the same holds true for those we perceive as giants. The trick is, therefore, to look at everything from a holistic perspective. Now, if only Gladwell had stuck to this basic premise. Nonetheless, his latest is a recommended read.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Insights</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Big boss</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1">Does a firm&rsquo;s management affect its borrowing costs? If research by <strong>Yihui Pan, Tracy Yue Wang and Michael S Weisbach </strong>is to be believed, the effects are quite substantiated. It has been noted that the greater the uncertainty surrounding the top executives at a firm, the higher the interest rates get. This pattern persists even when there is a change in the management, when the successor is not an heir to the business or when the lender and top management of the firm have no prior relationship. However, although management risk increases the likelihood of default and therefore the promised interest rates on debt, it should not affect expected returns on debt (or equity) or firms&rsquo; capital budgeting decisions if investors are well-diversified.

Zipping towards Apollo Bunder in the back of a classic <em>kaali-peeli</em> like jewel thieves from one of those &rsquo;70s Bollywood thrillers, we rush into the Taj&rsquo;s warmly-lit belly just as Tyeb Mehta&rsquo;s Untitled (Falling Bull) abstract piece goes under the hammer for a whopping Rs 17.5 crore (including buyer&rsquo;s premium). Senior Taj staffers apologetically steer us towards the secondary room, where a dour-faced Christie&rsquo;s employee stares down a rapidly thinning audience that sits with eyes peeled towards the screen there. On it is displayed lot number 15 of the collection that Christie&rsquo;s put on the block on December 11, 2014, and the spare mathematical figures accompanying it instantly make us think about 2BHK apartment prices in Borivli.</p>\n<p class="p3">For auction virgins whose best frames of reference for such events are weepy Hindi movies (with their archetypal business-<em>thapp</em>-family-kicked-out-<em>nilami </em>scenes), this was perhaps our best possible introduction to the world of art sales and auctions. This is new ground for London-based Christie&rsquo;s as well, which only opened its first India office in Mumbai in 2013 and held its inaugural auction last December. It has since opened another office in the national capital and, after last year&rsquo;s debut at the India Art Fair, is currently participating in the Kochi-Muziris Biennale. Buoyed by the high-nineties percentage of lots cleared in its last auction, with an abstract work by VS Gaitonde going for world-record levels of Rs 23.7 crore, Christie&rsquo;s embarked on an equally successful second round this year, with the auction worth a combined Rs 75 crore. Clearly, the piddly lakh-odd-rupees sales that made our heads lighten and stomachs turn were the tamer ones of the day.</p>\n<p class="p3">The process behind the pricing and sale of the 70-odd lots was thoroughly entertaining as well. Many of the pieces received heightened bids just by virtue of the names associated with them &mdash; the Husains, Souzas and Razas of the Indian Modernist art movement. Nevertheless, the lots all benefited from a measure of gentle hectoring by the mild-mannered auctioneer, who egged on the assembled moneybags with his trademark Brit humour. Once we were ushered into the Crystal Room &mdash; lined on both sides with some of the pieces to be auctioned and packed to the brim with rows upon rows of bidders &mdash; however, we realised what a role atmospherics play at such events. The gavel that came smashing down at the closing bid of a piece was now revealed as a small, compact device, though we still marveled at just how the auctioneer could hear the bids so clearly in the cavernous room.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">More so, because the backbencher trope seemed to extend to this setting as well &mdash; at the back of the room, there were a lot of high heels air-kissing and surreptitiously turning around to see if they had been recognised. Unfortunately, press photogs had eyes only for the rare canvases on display, showing ramp photographer-levels of frenzy when a luminescent work by VS Gaitonde went on the block. As we waited for some action, mulling over some basic questions &mdash; what happens if bidders default on payments, how does the auction house ensure that the paintings marked &lsquo;national treasure, not for export&rsquo; are not shipped out of the country, what kind of returns do people get on art investments &mdash; a set of paintings by Bengali artists that we had marveled at at another exhibition went up, one by one.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Just as we dream about being able to afford a tiny piece of the art world someday, Nobel laureate and national icon Rabindranath Tagore&rsquo;s pocket notebook sells for a whopping Rs 2.06 crore (including buyer&rsquo;s premium), four times its pre-sale estimate.

That&rsquo;s how large it is,&rdquo; he says, with a mix of dismay and optimism. Biba Apparels, the Rs 310-crore company that was started by his mother, Meena, in 1988, is today one of the biggest names in the ethnic wear (read: <em>salwar kameez</em> and <em>kurtis</em>) segment and it&rsquo;s not only customers who are flocking to it. Recently, private equity firms Warburg Pincus and Faering Capital, a fund promoted by Aditya Parekh and Sameer Shroff, put in Rs 300 crore for a 30% stake in the company, the largest ever in the space.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There&rsquo;s growing interest in the Indian ethnic and designer wear segments, and with good reason. According to Technopak, the overall market for women&rsquo;s wear is Rs 78,500 crore, of which ethnic wear alone brings in 75%. &ldquo;Barely 15% is organised and that is the big story. If the overall category is growing by 8-10%, the organised segment is growing by at least twice that number,&rdquo; says Bindra, whose brand is now available in 132 outlets and 200 large department stores.</p>\n<p class="p3">It is this growth that Kishore Biyani spotted in 2007, prompting him to take a 25.8% stake in Biba and acquire 22.86% the following year in ethnic and designer wear company AND Designs, which owns brands like AND, Global Desi and Anita Dongre. &ldquo;The maturity cycle in this industry is at least 7-8 years. If you want to make healthy returns, you must be patient,&rdquo; says Biyani. That virtue seems to have paid off, since he has pocketed a cool Rs 450 crore by exiting these two investments, with General Atlantic said to have picked up Future Group&rsquo;s holding in AND. While the exact breakup is not available, in an investor update, group company Future Lifestyle says that the profit from the sale of the Biba stake was Rs 190 crore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In 2011, Franklin Templeton private equity invested Rs 60 crore for a 20% stake in designer wear brand Kimaya Fashions, which today has a topline of Rs 75 crore.

(218, 12, '', 'A finger on India''s pulse', '<p class="p1">The year 1997 is etched in Kanchan Naikawadi&rsquo;s mind. Going through her first pregnancy at the time, she remembers being elated, excited and a little confused. The confusion stemmed from watching her father look drained and ill, though she couldn&rsquo;t put her finger on what could be wrong with him. What he and the family hadn&rsquo;t told her was that he had been diagnosed with advanced stage cancer. So while the then-25-year-old Kanchan focused on the new arrival, her father received regular chemotherapy sessions and kept his distance from her, for fear of radiation affecting the unborn child. A month after her baby&rsquo;s birth, he passed away.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">What made it worse were glib comments by visitors at condolence meets. &ldquo;Many would say, &lsquo;How did you not know it was cancer, how did you not catch it early?&rsquo; First-stage cancer is not always symptomatic, and by the time the first signs showed up, the cancer had already advanced. After reading more about the topic, we understood there were ways to figure out and anticipate these things; there were diagnostics available,&rdquo; says Kanchan. That&rsquo;s when she and her husband, Amol, decided to come up with a way to make early disease detection commonly available.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;We have a finance, not medical, background. But the concept of preventive healthcare struck us as an interesting business idea. It makes better sense to detect a disease early on rather than waste time and money on tests and treatment. So, we started looking into how we could get people interested in preventive screening.&rdquo; The couple went on to start Indus Health Plus where Kanchan is now designated as managing director.</p>\n<p class="p3">The couple studied WHO statistics and global trends to zero in on the diseases they wanted to target. Doctors in their network guided them on the diagnostic tests they would need. In 2000, the Naikawadis convinced the same group of doctors to partner with them for their maiden run. The doctors set up and started running a diagnostic centre at Model Colony, Pune, while the duo helped with back-end support. &ldquo;We set up Indus Health Plus in the office right above that centre, pooling in Rs 50 lakh from personal savings, family and friends. And that split between their diagnostics process and our back-end services became the model we based our business on,&rdquo; says Amol, joint managing director of the firm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Healing touch</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">That business idea has now grown into nearly 82 outlets across major Indian cities and towns. So, what does Indus Health do? In a nutshell, it acts as a single point of consultation when you need to know how healthy you are but don&rsquo;t know where to start. Through its partners, the firm puts together a range of diagnostic procedures at close to half the market price, without itself investing anything more than back-end support and clerical assistance. While this delivers a constant flow of business to bigger hospitals and market recognition for smaller centres, customers reap the benefit of a high-quality, customised diagnostic experience at rock-bottom prices.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Indus Health Plus- element</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Though most hospital and medical chains have in-house laboratories, they often outsource the diagnostic function or struggle to monetise this component of their services. This is where Indus Health comes in. It negotiates with hospitals to understand their costs and agrees upon a mark-up for the partner hospital. Once the deal is finalised, Indus Health adds its own mark-up (around 10%) before selling the package to clients at a price lower than market rates. Hospitals agree because of assured volumes. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t lose money or have to invest in this relationship. Instead, they have customers delivered to them on a platter,&rdquo; says Amol. Since 2000, Indus has reached out to nearly 420,000 customers and had a turnover of #96 crore in FY13. The company has tie-ups in 38 cities &mdash; a major chunk of which are tier 2 and 3 towns &mdash; where its centres run close to 250 check-ups a day.</p>\n<p class="p3">And how exactly does Indus Health work? On signing up, customers can choose from a range of diagnostic test packages based on their age, pre-existing conditions and requirements. One of the big draws of the firm is that people can gift packages to their friends and family as well. Once all the details are submitted, Indus Health&rsquo;s 400-strong workforce, 40% of whom are women, takes over. First, representatives from the firm&rsquo;s call centre in Pune contact the customer and guide them to the closest Indus Health partner clinic or hospital, where the firm&rsquo;s employees aid them through the diagnostic process. Irrespective of the package, all the tests are conducted and results delivered on the same day. Before they leave, customers are also counselled by partner doctors about disease management and other precautions. The call centre follows up with clients, who get significant discounts on both future tests (up to a year) as well as on related treatments at the partner centres.</p>\n<p class="p3">In towns where medical infrastructure is a problem, Indus Health provides its clients a list of packages at the nearest medical centre. For instance, if the firm&rsquo;s sales team signs up customers in, say, Jalgaon, they travel to Aurangabad for the tests at an Indus Health centre. Having covered nine states so far, the company has set its sights on enlarging its India presence and aims to expand operations to the subcontinent, West Asia and Africa in the near future.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>In good health</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Is Indus Health then an aggregator of services such as Makemytrip for travel? No, because based on disease trends, it groups together different tests as comprehensive packages &mdash; ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 17,000. The company currently counts Apollo, Sterling, NM, Wockhardt, SRL and Sahyadri hospitals among its partners. While its partner centres could be anything from trust hospitals to a standalone unit, preference is given to hospital chains that are present at multiple locations within the same city, provided they have the requisite infrastructure at these locations. Prince Surana, director of the Surana Sethia Hospital &amp; Research Centre in Mumbai, recalls Indus Health approaching him in 2007-2008. &ldquo;We were a bit sceptical initially. However, we are now very happy with the partnership as the Indus Health association has increased credibility of our diagnostics centre,&rdquo; he says. The hospital has &ldquo;an understanding&rdquo; with Indus Health based on the number of check-ups and footfalls. &ldquo;But more than the sharing ratio, we gain through branding and exposure. Moreover, there is scope for growth in the industry, as only 5-8% of the preventive healthcare segment has been tapped so far,&rdquo; Surana adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">This is evident in Indus Health&rsquo;s financial success. A majority of its profits come from its core market of tier 2 and 3 towns. &ldquo;At first, we thought that this was an urban product. Thankfully, we were proved wrong; the service is very popular in smaller towns, with youngsters living in the cities gifting diagnostic packages to their parents back home,&rdquo; Amol says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Forward march</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Though the company is growing at a fast clip, it faces significant competition from the in-house diagnostic arms of most major hospital chains and the countless small medical centres that have mushroomed across the metros and offer aggressive rates. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">And, unlike hospitals that can get captive customers for their preventive check-ups through corporate tie-ups etc, Indus Health needs to dig deeper into the country to get its clientele, investing more time and effort per customer. About half of its business comes from retail clients acquired by its agents, 30% from existing clients and their referrals while the rest is from corporate clients. The last includes FMCG companies providing check-ups for their retailers and credit card companies offering special packages to cardholders. &ldquo;Apart from a significant amount of advertising, we carry out community outreach programmes at housing societies, corporate firms, etc. At least 20% of revenue is devoted to customer acquisition,&rdquo; says Amol.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There&rsquo;s also competition from chains such as Thyrocare, which have disrupted the space with rock-bottom prices for test packages. Amol, though, doesn&rsquo;t consider Thyrocare (incidentally, an erstwhile partner) direct competition, since he says it provides only lab tests compared with Indus Health, which includes lab, diagnostics, radiology, counselling etc. &ldquo;We may not be able to stop competing laboratories from dropping their prices drastically, but we definitely can maintain our stream of customers,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Most other labs depend on referrals from general practitioners for business, whereas we aggressively target only the preventive healthcare market.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Industry analysts are also bullish on growth prospects. Amit Mookim, healthcare industry head at KPMG, points out that the global wellness and preventive care market is much more evolved due to a competent insurance model, where corporates and insurance companies incentivise preventive health checkups through rewards and discounts. In India, however, the insurance sector is nascent and there are several regulatory concerns. So, there is very low awareness about preventive healthcare and not much scope or infrastructure for such services. &ldquo;Despite these challenges, Indus Health has succeeded and is very popular among corporate clients. Now is the right time for such services to take off in India,&rdquo; says Mookim.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Insurance firms in India, too, are moving towards preventive screening. Abhijeet Ghosh, head, health analytics and networking, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, says of every 100 policies sold, the frequency of claims is sometimes as low as 10-15%, which means nearly 85-90% health policyholders don&rsquo;t file for a claim. &ldquo;So, we now offer customers preventive screenings as value-added services. We give them health and wellness cards that they can use at diagnostic centres, hospital chains, opticians, etc. that we have tied up with and get discounts on diagnostics and medication,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It is this potential for growth that has investors reaching out to the Naikawadis, although the couple hasn&rsquo;t opted for external funding yet. &ldquo;Ours is an asset-light model, so we do get a lot of investor attention,&rdquo; says Amol. A big hurdle, though, is that Indus Health still struggles to find the right partners and maintain the same quality across centres. Thanks to a fragmented provider network and low awareness about preventive healthcare, it will be challenging for the company to sustain its growth rate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"As long as it makes the diagnostic process for customers easier, the firm will grow" - Amit Mookim, healthcare industry head, KPMG</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">But, as KPMG&rsquo;s Mookim points out, globally, the drop-off rate for preventive healthcare packages is quite high, with only 40-50% of customers renewing their contracts; in India, this number is a measly 10-20%. Adds Mookim, &ldquo;As long as the firm drives a good bargain on packages and makes the diagnostic process easier for the customer, it should stay on the growth path.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>', 'Preventive screening service company Indus Health Plus has a a solution for the country''s growing health woes', '12', '', 0, '', 'a-finger-on-indias-pulse-218', 213, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'A finger on india''s pulse', 'Preventive screening service company Indus Health Plus has a a solution for the country''s growing health woes', '', '', '', 'Indus Health Plus,Preventive screening,Diagnostics centres,Thyrocare', 0, NULL, '2015-01-23 11:48:22', '2015-01-23 12:02:20', '2014-01-18', 0);

(219, 12, '', 'Vada pav adventures', '<p class="p1">Mihir Shah loves his food and makes no bones about it. He&rsquo;s picky about what he eats: toast and eggs for breakfast, a vegetarian lunch, a 4 pm snack and then dinner. The late afternoon bite, says the 32-year-old marketing executive, is the meal he looks forward to the most. For two decades, Shah&rsquo;s choice has been the <em>vada pav</em>, a potato patty stuffed between a local bun variant, topped with chutney. It&rsquo;s hailed as the common man&rsquo;s food in Mumbai, where street vendors do brisk business in the snack all day. But Shah, who like most Mumbaiites is no stranger to eating <em>vada pav</em> on the roadside, no longer heads to the nearby hawker for his fix. From two <em>vada pav</em> at a sitting, he&rsquo;s down to two a week, but for the past few years, that order has been served at a regular shop, where gloved servers hand him his snack on a disposable plate and offer paper napkins as well. &ldquo;Hygiene makes a difference even if it is junk food,&rdquo; says Shah. &ldquo;This is still authentic street food, but in a cleaner environment.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">As a concept, though, <em>vada pav</em> in a formal, restaurant setting is yet to take off. There are only two chains across India that serve the snack as the main item on the menu and, between them, have 280 stores. Driven by their success so far, these two companies want to create a pan-India customer base for this very regional food item by expanding outside Maharashtra, and taking on the ubiquitous <em>idli</em> and <em>samosa</em> to become an all-India snack. Where multi-cuisine Indian fast-food chains such as Haldiram&rsquo;s, Bikanervala and Saravana Bhavan that have nationwide recognition, if not presence, are going rather slow on expansion, can Goli Vada Pav and JumboKing really succeed in their audacious plan?</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>The first bite</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">It&rsquo;s a humid afternoon in Mulund, a distant suburb in central Mumbai, and Venkatesh Iyer is looking for a cool place to sit inside his cramped Goli Vada Pav outlet. He peeps into the kitchen, where a potato <em>vada</em> is being fried to be served to customers waiting outside, to see if there&rsquo;s a suitable spot and quickly decides to take the conversation to the nearby McDonald&rsquo;s. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s much larger than our little stores,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">The lack of space isn&rsquo;t really an issue. When Iyer and his friend Shivadas Menon decided to set up Goli Vada Pav nearly a decade ago, the idea was mainly to serve authentic ethnic Indian snacks in a clean, hygienic environment &mdash; it wasn&rsquo;t about becoming a sit-down restaurant where people would linger over their meals. &ldquo;We wanted to make something that could be served quickly and in large numbers,&rdquo; says the 47-year-old Iyer who before setting up Goli was running a corporate finance business with Menon. After much debate on whether to open an <em>idli</em>-<em>dosa</em> type South Indian snack outlet, they decided to go with their taste buds&rsquo; preference and in early 2004 opened the first outlet at Kalyan, in Thane district, with Rs 1 crore from their savings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Today, Goli Vada Pav has 224 stores across 10 states, including Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, NCR and Gujarat. But Mumbai, the real home of the <em>vada pav</em>, has just nine stores, for a very good reason. &ldquo;Why would anyone come to us when the snack is so easily available in any part of Mumbai?&rdquo; Iyer asks. Last year, the company had a turnover of Rs 25 crore with a profit margin of close to 10% and is targeting revenue of Rs 40 crore in FY14. That growth will come from outside Maharashtra, says Iyer, where there is huge potential to charge a premium for the snack. &ldquo;We sell the most basic version at #12 in Maharashtra. In Delhi and Bengaluru, the minimum price is Rs 20,&rdquo; he says. So, even if volumes outside the state are lower, sales in value terms are comparable. &ldquo;In Mangalore, we clock Rs 40,000 per day, which is as much as we make at Ranjangaon in Maharashtra.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It was this growth that prompted venture capital fund VenturEast to invest $4.7 million (then Rs 21 crore) in Goli in August 2011. KA Srinivasan, CFO, VenturEast, says Goli&rsquo;s model has been proven in a large city such as Bengaluru (where the chain has over 65 stores) and also smaller towns such as Hubli, Tirupati and Agra. &ldquo;Geographically speaking, this only means that the potential for growth or setting up new stores is unlimited,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Even as Iyer decided against carrying coals to Newcastle and began expanding early outside Mumbai, the other <em>vada pav</em> chain chose to do exactly the opposite. JumboKing, which is older by three years, was setting up more outlets in Mumbai around the same time Goli was being launched. When Dheeraj Gupta completed his MBA, he was keen on getting into the food business, but not through his family&rsquo;s restaurant and hotel business. Inspired by the McDonald&rsquo;s success story, he wanted to try something similar. &ldquo;I wondered why there couldn&rsquo;t be an Indian burger,&rdquo; recalls Gupta.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In 2001, with Rs 2 lakh borrowed from his family, he opened the first JumboKing store, offering variants of the local snack. With outlets located strategically near railway stations, the chain positioned itself not only on the hygiene and cleanliness plank, but also as the perfect finger food for people on the go. Starting out with both franchisees and owned outlets, JumboKing moved to an all-owned outlet model in 2004.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It was a bad idea, Gupta attests, smiling wryly when you remind him of a mid-2008 interview where he spoke of JumboKing having 1,000 stores by the end of 2012, at a time when the chain had 45 stores. &ldquo;We have not got anywhere near that,&rdquo; he admits. Indeed, there are just 53 stores currently and a revenue of Rs 17 crore in FY13.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Goli and JumboKing element</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;We thought it was important to have control over processes and product quality. Today, we realise we do not need that level of control,&rdquo; says Gupta. By insisting on company outlets, JumboKing lost out on two counts &mdash; time in execution and a deeper understanding of local markets. But then, there were important learnings. For example, when the brand ventured into Ahmedabad in 2007, customers were disappointed to see a 2,000 sq ft outlet that essentially had only one item on its menu. &ldquo;Customers felt let down by such a limited range in a big store,&rdquo; says Gupta. The learning: stick to smaller stores where the limited range won&rsquo;t be an issue. Now, there&rsquo;s a master franchisee model in place, where Gupta charges 6% royalty (the global norm) on sales. JumboKing is looking at a turnover of Rs 25 crore this year, says Gupta, who holds a 65% stake in the company, with the rest held by high net worth individuals who have invested Rs 8 crore in two rounds of funding in 2006 and 2009.</p>\n<p class="p3">Prices at both chains are comparable. Rates start at Rs 12 for the plain vanilla version and go up to Rs 30, depending on the add-ons. While JumboKing has 12 types of <em>vada pav</em> on offer, Goli has eight, with options such as whole wheat <em>pav</em> instead of refined flour, and variants such as cheese, schezwan and <em>sabudana</em>. Sonia Mehrotra, associate professor at&nbsp;LN&nbsp;Welingkar&nbsp;Institute of Management, Development and Research and the co-author of a case study on Goli Vada Pav, says, &ldquo;Even a&nbsp;<em>samosa</em>&nbsp;tastes different across India and it is imperative that a&nbsp;<em>vada pav</em> goes with the local flavour.&rdquo; With Goli, that means introducing special variants for different markets, such as <em>palak-makai</em> in Bengaluru and masala<em> vada pav</em> in Indore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>McDonaldising vada pav</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">So far, so good. Both firms have plans to establish themselves as pan-Indian brands with a presence extending over several hundred outlets. Over the last two months, JumboKing opened its first outlet in Delhi, after forays into Mysore, Amravati and Raipur. The focus is to move outside Mumbai (which accounts for 29 stores) and close FY14 with 73 stores, heading to Lucknow, Gurgaon and Pune. &ldquo;We plan to increase store count by 50% each year,&rdquo; says Gupta.</p>\n<p class="p3">Iyer is aiming for 800 stores in the next five years, at Kochi, Chandigarh and Jaipur, with a turnover of at least Rs 200 crore. Goli&rsquo;s financiers believe in the numbers. Says VenturEast&rsquo;s Srinivasan, &ldquo;The Goli model is highly attractive to franchises because their capital investment is low, with the ability to break even quickly.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The Goli model is highly attractive to franchises because their capital investment is low" - KA Srinivasan, CFO, VenturEast</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">There is certainly room for growth. The market for chain restaurants, according to Technopak, is $2.5 billion in size, with quick service restaurants (QSRs) accounting for half at $1.1 billion. At a projected market size of $8 billion in 2020, QSRs are expected to be as large as $4.2 billion, a whopping four-fold increase from today&rsquo;s level. But what makes Iyer&rsquo;s plan seem audacious is that no established fast food chain in India has anywhere close to that number of stores yet. There are 650 Domino&rsquo;s Pizza stores, 250 McDonald&rsquo;s restaurants and 407 Subway outlets in the country &mdash; and these are well-accepted brands serving food consumed all over India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Of course, there&rsquo;s a world of difference between, say, a McDonald&rsquo;s outlet and a <em>vada pav</em> stall. The fast food tag notwithstanding, the golden arches chain insists on some basics in its restaurants &mdash; air-conditioning, seating for a given number of customers, more staff to attend to customers and a minimum store size. The <em>vada pav</em> outlets won&rsquo;t need any of these bells and whistles &mdash; the average store will be just 200 sq ft, staffed by three or four people, and will focus on takeaway or stand-eat-and-go customers. Which means it&rsquo;s easier and cheaper to open stores.</p>\n<p class="p3">What will also help the expansion of both brands is their supply chain, which is completely outsourced, with the companies owning nothing except the formula and the brand name, for which the franchisees pay a royalty. JumboKing sources 80% of its patties from Tasty Bites in Pune, while 20% comes from Vista Processed Foods, a subsidiary of OSI Inc, which also makes the McDonald&rsquo;s burgers across the world; the mayonnaise comes from Mrs Bector Foods. For Goli, the patties are made by Vista Foods, while the mayonnaise comes from Unilever. Perishables such as the <em>pav</em> and chutneys are sourced locally at both firms. In addition, JumboKing has four cold rooms, in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Indore and Delhi, while Goli has outsourced this function and has 15 cold rooms across locations such as Bengaluru, Nashik and Delhi.</p>\n<p class="p3">But, it&rsquo;s significant that no regional food has made it big as a national brand yet. Indians are notoriously parochial when it comes to food and while <em>dosas</em> and <em>idlis</em> may have made it to the menu nationwide, there&rsquo;s no pan-India chain dedicated to them. &ldquo;Indian foods have significant regional variations that make it harder to standardise them,&rdquo; says GV Ravi Shankar, MD, Sequoia Capital, an investor in Faaso&rsquo;s. &ldquo;But if someone can take the positives (variety and taste), standardise the product and solve the supply chain problem (Western brands are based on deep frozen cold-chain driven backends), the model becomes scalable.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Even Haldiram&rsquo;s and Bikanervala have multi-cuisine menus (from <em>chhole-bhature</em> to <em>bhel puri</em>, <em>idli dosa</em> and chowmein) and neither has anything close to a nationwide presence yet. Instead, as Gulpreet Gulri, country head, Subway India, says, it is global brands that have an aggregate 63% share of the domestic QSR market. That&rsquo;s because Indian eateries are hit by a double whammy, explains Deepta Gupta, executive VP of the Rs 1,000-crore Bikanervala Group. Global chains have one base dish &mdash; burger, pizza, etc &mdash; while a multi-cuisine chain has a large menu, reducing scope for standardisation. Also, consumers aren&rsquo;t willing to spend as much on Indian food. Barring a presence in Hyderabad, all of Bikanervala&rsquo;s 34 outlets are in North India. &ldquo;The recipe for success is to have about 90% of the standard menu but bring in a local touch. We have to ensure people come to our outlet for what we are best known: North Indian food.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The key to success lies in understanding consumers'' needs and finding a place for the brand in their life" - Harneet Singh Rajpal, vice-president, Domino''s Pizza India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s what makes Iyer and Gupta optimistic. &ldquo;The <em>vada pav</em> has found appeal outside Maharashtra since it is positioned as &lsquo;Mumbai&rsquo;s favourite food&rsquo;. People are curious since they may not have had it but are familiar with the name,&rdquo; says Gupta. Iyer&rsquo;s reasoning is along similar lines. &ldquo;Potato as a vegetable has very high levels of acceptability across India. It is used in <em>paranthas</em>, chips and <em>bondas</em> and we knew we could capitalise on this,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Outside Maharashtra, the vada pav has found appeal since it is positioned as ''Mumbai''s favourite food''" - Dheeraj Gupta, founder, JumboKing</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Even if taste buds are conquered, there are other challenges facing the QSR business. The huge potential notwithstanding, success doesn&rsquo;t come easily, whether you&rsquo;re an Indian or MNC chain. Harneet Singh Rajpal, vice-president, Domino&rsquo;s Pizza India, points to many challenges &mdash; shortage of skilled manpower, development of the cold chain infrastructure network, high rentals, high food inflation levels and licensing requirements. &ldquo;The key to success, though, lies in understanding consumers&rsquo; needs and finding a place for the brand in the consumer&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; he adds. The trick, then, for Goli and JumboKing: continue with the Chinese and cheese <em>vada pav</em>, but stick to the Mumbai roots. Oh, and continue to keep prices low.&nbsp;</p>', 'How two local chains have plans for the humble Mumbai snack to go national ', '7', '', 0, '', 'vada-pav-adventures-219', 214, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Vada pav adventures', 'How two local chains have plans for the humble Mumbai snack to go national ', '', '', '', 'Goli Vada Pav,JumboKing,VenturEast,Haldiram''s,Bikanervala,QSR', 0, NULL, '2015-01-23 12:04:23', '2015-01-23 12:27:37', '2014-01-18', 0),
(220, 16, '', 'Not your father''s beer', '<p class="p1">You know those bartenders who pour your beer oh-so-carefully to ensure there&rsquo;s barely a bubble on the surface? Serious beer-drinkers would insist the foam is essential to the drink &mdash; the bubbles release the aroma of the drink, adding to the flavour. SABMiller clearly doesn&rsquo;t agree. In July 2012, the liquor major launched (or rather, relaunched) Indus Pride, a beer that is certainly packed with flavour, but has no head. Indus Pride was introduced in four variants &mdash; citrusy coriander, citrusy cardamom, spicy fennel and fiery cinnamon &mdash; and is now, 18 months later, being promoted on the Indian specialty brew platform. &ldquo;Creating an Indian specialty beer sub-category was not easy. Unlike a standard lager, our range is very different and is brewed with authentic Indian spices,&rdquo; claims Jyotishman Deka, vice-president (marketing), SABMiller India.</p>\n<p class="p3">The current marketing overdrive is yet another attempt by SABMiller to boost the brand. The company, which also owns other well-known beer brands such as Haywards, Knock Out, Foster&rsquo;s and Royal Challenge, first introduced Indus Pride as a mild beer in 2008 and phased it out a couple of years later. It was relaunched with <em>desi</em> flavours when, says Deka, research showed that urban consumers were looking for a beer with a strong <br /> Indian connection.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Trouble is, the Indian specialty brew platform on which Indus Pride has been relaunched doesn&rsquo;t really exist and most industry observers believe that flavoured beer will be an acquired taste at best. Certainly, at #85 for a 330-ml bottle (compared with #60 for a 330-ml can of Kingfisher), even SABMiller concedes Indus Pride is a premium offering. The drink is available only in Mumbai, NCR, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Pune, Goa and Chandigarh and sales figures could not be sourced. Distributers and resellers, however, haven&rsquo;t been too enthused, even though the company offers the last mile retailer a 6% margin. This is higher than Kingfisher&rsquo;s 4-5%, but lower than Carlsberg&rsquo;s 8-9%. Randip Singh Munjral, owner of Shah &amp; Co, one of Mumbai&rsquo;s largest liquor outlets, says, &ldquo;In more developed markets, people experiment with new beer tastes. That is not the case in India.&rdquo; Moreover, he says, it&rsquo;s the taste that matters, not the price. &ldquo;If consumers like the drink, it won&rsquo;t matter if it is expensive.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">For SABMiller, there is more than a little riding on the success of Indus Pride, since its overall market share has been under some serious pressure. According to Euromonitor, between 2008 and 2012, the company&rsquo;s share across its brands has dropped sharply from 35% to 27%, of which Haywards brings in 15.9%. For the same period, the UB Group has just about held on to its 52% market share. Even a relatively new entrant Carlsberg has seen its share moving from 0.8% to 6.4% in the 23 million hectolitre beer industry, which has grown by 77% in volume terms during 2007-12.</p>\n<p class="p3">Pradeep Gidwani, who headed Foster&rsquo;s India for six years before it was acquired globally by SABMiller, agrees that spiced beer has very little awareness compared with lager beer. But, he points out, half the volumes at his Pint Room beer caf&eacute; come from ale. &ldquo;There is opportunity beyond lager, but it is a long process,&rdquo; he adds. Which means it may be a while before India&rsquo;s big head drinkers develop a taste for SABMiller&rsquo;s spicy brew.&nbsp;</p>', 'SABMiller is banking on its spiced local brew to bolster sales', '7', '', 0, '', 'not-your-fathers-beer-220', 215, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Not your father''s beer ', 'SABMiller is banking on its spiced local brew to bolster sales', '', '', '', 'SABMiller,Indus Pride,Flavoured beer,Kingfisher''s,Carlsberg''s', 0, NULL, '2015-01-23 12:34:48', NULL, '2014-01-18', 0),
(221, 16, '', 'It''s Showtime', '<p class="p1">It was 2009. The real estate market had tanked. Mall developers were stuck with unsold stock. Pramod Arora had just returned to PVR from a year-long stint with Kingston Properties (now Oberoi Realty). He had previously spent 12 years at PVR but the brief switchover to real estate did him a world of good, he says: &ldquo;It had opened my eyes to thinking big.&rdquo; The slowdown was a now-or-never opportunity, and Arora knew instinctively what to do. He told his team and a few broking agents that he was giving a flight ticket a day to them to travel across the country and check out which malls were affected the most and, therefore, ripe for the picking.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Over the next three-and-a-half months, they notched up a staggering number of air miles. &ldquo;At any point in time, we had eight people travelling.&rdquo; What they found was equally staggering: 392 suitable properties across 27 Indian cities were available. &ldquo;We signed them up at Rs 18-20 per sq ft &mdash; prices that were unbelievable then,&rdquo; Arora recalls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It was a perfect time to seal those deals. Developers, under pressure, were only too willing to sign up contracts on terms that were tilted in PVR&rsquo;s favour. But there was one hitch to the seemingly rash bet. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t have the board&rsquo;s approval yet, and there was a three-month window before we could go ahead with these agreements,&rdquo; says Arora, who is now PVR&rsquo;s group president. &ldquo;It was a tough call. We had taken a risk; we stood to forfeit Rs 3-3.5 crore if it didn&rsquo;t come through.&rdquo; Luckily, it did, and PVR picked up all of them. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Blockbuster hit - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Those 392 deals changed the face of PVR,&rdquo; says Arora. It was among the many bold moves that have marked the rise of India&rsquo;s first cinema multiplex company to the top. Last year, founder Ajay Bijli took a big gamble by buying out Mumbai&rsquo;s Cinemax chain for Rs 543 crore to emerge as the largest multiplex chain in the country by size <em>(see: Blockbuster hit</em>). PVR now has 402 operational screens, and another 300 under development. The company delivered Rs 674 crore in revenue in FY13, growing by 39%. It registered 32.6 million footfalls in FY13 against 24.7 million in FY12, a 32% spurt. What next?</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Hunger games</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">&ldquo;We plan to have 500 screens by next year,&rdquo; says Bijli. Cinema exhibition is a numbers game. The more screens and seats, the better the leverage with film producers and distributors, and pretty much everyone associated with the business. PVR is looking to add around 100 screens every year. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very important to create cinemas that are not just efficient but have a wow factor as well,&rdquo; points out Sanjeev Kumar, Bijli&rsquo;s younger brother and PVR&rsquo;s joint MD. Meanwhile, competition is growing: with its acquisition of Fame Cinemas in 2010, Inox is a serious contender for the top position with 288 screens, followed by Big Cinemas with 254 screens in India. Mexico&rsquo;s Cinepolis, the first FDI-led investment in the space, is another player to watch out for.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Edelweiss Securities&rsquo; associate director Abneesh Roy believes the multiplex industry in India will pan out just as it has in other markets &mdash; as an oligopoly, under the control of a few players. That means size and scale matter most, but the distinctive edge could come from enhancing the experiential aspects. &ldquo;The movie theatre business is a very detail-oriented industry, where you need passion. PVR&rsquo;s promoters have that passion,&rdquo; points out Roy. Multiplexes are a minority in the Indian cinema exhibition space by numbers, but they wield considerable leverage with Bollywood. And there is plenty of room to grow, says Bijli. &ldquo;India has less than 2,000 new built multiplex screens. The other 7,000 are still single screens; there is no incentive for their owners to invest further,&rdquo; he adds further. No wonder he is in a hurry to ramp up fast yet profitably.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The Cinemax acquisition has been PVR&rsquo;s high point in recent years, more so after a failed attempt at inorganic growth with DLF&rsquo;s DT Cinemas in 2009. This time, it was a tightly managed affair. &ldquo;This acquisition was special. It was almost the same size as our balance sheet and it was the fastest we could manage. From the time we shook hands to closure, it took us only 27 days,&rdquo; says Nitin Sood, CFO, PVR. The acquired properties are yet to shift to the PVR brand, and Bijli is as obsessed with the changeover as he is with his own properties. &ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t look like a fake PVR,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I keep saying at our brand change meetings. The last thing I want to put is the logo.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Kamal Gianchandani, who rejoined the group in 2010 after a four-year stint with Reliance Entertainment, is in charge of the Cinemax integration. With an additional role as CEO of Cinemax, apart from heading the film distribution arm as president of PVR Pictures, he is focused currently on making the acquisition work. &ldquo;About 75-80% of my time is spent on Cinemax, trying to ramp up revenue, integrating with PVR and ironing out differences in culture. That will be my focus for the next 10-12 months,&rdquo; he says. This has meant cross-transfer of best practices and processes between the two entities. &ldquo;Cinemax brought us&nbsp; a new level of understanding of the business. Their fiscal control was much higher and we were able to imbibe that into PVR,&rdquo; adds Arora.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Cinemax brought us a new level of understanding of the business. Their fiscal control was much higher" - Pramod Arora, group president, PVR</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">PVR initially stayed focused on the north India cluster, particularly Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR). Buying Cinemax nearly tripled its properties in the west, and added some screens in south India as well. It now has an edge over competition, though Inox and Big Cinemas have also been growing their properties across the country. &ldquo;South India accounts for 60% of the 9,000-odd screens in India, thus making it a lucrative market to tap. The management targets 25% revenue contribution from the south by FY15, which will drive growth,&rdquo; says Niket Shah of Motilal Oswal Securities in a report on PVR. Even as PVR works to seamlessly integrate Cinemax with its existing business, it is also working on ways to improve revenue from the multiplex business as a whole. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Beyond popcorn</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Given that the exhibition business has zero content differentiation, PVR is seeking to increase the average ticket price (ATP), which currently stands at Rs 163 (a blended price following the Cinemax takeover), by engaging with customers beyond the movie experience. PVR&rsquo;s ATP is already significantly higher than its peers (and expected to rise to Rs 180 in FY15), primarily due to its prime location strategy, premium interiors, design and consistent viewing experience, according to Shah. Bijli has also been working at other aspects and adding new lines that augment and help bring revenue. Among them are in-theatre advertising, which includes both on-screen and off-screen advertising, food and beverages (F&amp;B) and other forms of leisure and entertainment that complement PVR&rsquo;s business.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In the past three years, growth in F&amp;B has been driven by PVR&rsquo;s efforts to improve offerings and the fact that it has taken liquor licences at premium locations. Sood informs that average F&amp;B spends at PVR are Rs 47-55 per customer. While F&amp;B contribution to revenues for Inox grew from 18% to 22% in the past five years, for PVR this figure grew almost similarly from 19.5% to 23% in the same period. Post Cinemax, the F&amp;B growth doubled in FY13 by 70%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The F&amp;B growth initiatives come under PVR Leisure, a JV with L Capital, the private equity arm of the LVMH Group. Under this are Mistral and Mr Hong, both unique experiments in multiplex chains. European fine dining restaurant Mistral, at Ambience Mall in Gurgaon, has an open-sky beer bar, a vodka and whisky bar and an open kitchen with a sandwich counter and grill just outside PVR Director&rsquo;s Cut, its top-end theatre offering. Mr Hong, on the other hand, is an upcoming chain of Oriental &lsquo;all-day dining&rsquo;, the first of which will open shortly in Bengaluru.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Come one, come all- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;We are looking at several brands. The idea here is to build a full-fledged F&amp;B division within the group itself,&rdquo; says Renaud Palliere, CEO, international development, PVR, who is in charge of the F&amp;B business. &ldquo;There is a critical mass that warrants new initiatives. The PVR brand equity is built around an ecosystem where 75 million people are walking in through our doors on an annual basis.&rdquo; Getting them to spend more is the key.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">At the theatre itself, there are different brand formats to appeal to different customer groups, from PVR Director&rsquo;s Cut (ultra-premium and exclusive), PVR Imax, PVR Gold (premium), PVR (regular) and PVR Talkies (economy). Cinemax has also given PVR access to more 3D-enabled theatres &mdash; the company now has 94 such screens, which include two Imax theatres (three more are being developed) and 61 Cinemax screens.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The low-end theatre concept, PVR Talkies, is aimed at tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Against an ATP of Rs 180-200 in larger cities, tickets at PVR Talkies are priced at Rs 80-100. It works on a more tightly controlled model with the cost of setting up each screen at Rs 1-1.25 crore, compared with Rs 2-2.5 crore in large, urban centres. Three such properties are already operational in Vadodara, Latur and Aurangabad, which COO Gautam Dutta terms &lsquo;pilots&rsquo;.</p>\n<p class="p3">At the other end of the spectrum is Director&rsquo;s Cut, which has screens with various seating capacities down to a 25-seater for exclusive group bookings. Tickets are priced at Rs 1,000 each on weekdays and Rs 1,400 each on weekends, and come with electronically-controlled recliner seats, blankets and in-seat ordering of gourmet meals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Another concept PVR is building up is BluO. A bowling chain through a JV with Thailand&rsquo;s Major Cineplex, it has six centres operational across five cities, with the seventh coming up at Ludhiana. Half of its revenues come from bowling. Each centre is over 30,000 sq ft, with 22-25 bowling lanes each.&nbsp; With investments of Rs 75-80 lakh per lane, the typical fit-out period is six to seven months. &ldquo;We are growing 8-10% annually on same-store sales,&rdquo; says Vishal Sawhney, COO, PVR BluO Entertainment. But it&rsquo;s a challenging business. &ldquo;Bowling is not a common sport in India.&rdquo; concedes Sawhney. So, scaling up isn&rsquo;t easy: &ldquo;We cannot open more than two or three centres in a year.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s now working on stirring up interest through corporate and women-only bowling leagues. &ldquo;We have trainers at every centre educating people on how to bowl. Each centre has the potential to do business worth Rs 10-15 crore annually.&rdquo; PVR BluO has contributed around 4% to revenues, growing 30% last year.</p>\n<p class="p3">Another new concept is the Enhanced Cinema Experience (ECX), which has been launched first at the Phoenix Market City mall in Mumbai and the Orion Mall in Bengaluru. These screens offer 7.1 Dolby surround sound, 4K digital projection against 2K on regular screens and gourmet F&amp;B options.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>The bigger picture</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Certainly, PVR has a lot going for it. Its real estate tie-ups are strong, for one, and that makes a key difference. But multiplexes depend upon content and its success, and that&rsquo;s often an uncertain bet. It hasn&rsquo;t been a good season lately for the business as many big releases didn&rsquo;t fare too well, Sood admits. Still, he&rsquo;s banking on PVR&rsquo;s reputation to secure good mall locations and build on the ones that it already has. &ldquo;The industry will consolidate further in the next 24 months. We&rsquo;ve seen enough cycles to know that,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Competition is also nipping at its heels. With 84 screens across 13 Indian cities, Cinepolis has barely begun to scratch the surface in India&rsquo;s cinema exhibition landscape, even as it ranks fourth globally with 3,290 screens. A rift between its Indian founding members and the Mexican management has kept it in the news, but country head Ashish Shukla says he&rsquo;s on track to deliver 80-100 new screens in the coming year, and touch 500 screens by 2017. Its megaplex approach is setting the tone for the scale at which multiplexes will be built in major urban centres. &ldquo;This has proven successful for us across the globe. It&rsquo;s our core business,&rdquo; he says. The first one opened in Magarpatta City in Pune with 15 screens. &ldquo;We have eight screens per location on an average, while others have 3.5.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We are on track to deliver 80-100 nw screens in the coming year and touch 500 screens by 2017" - Ashish Shukla, country head, Cinepolis</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">While megaplexes are the way to go, these may not be enough to give Cinepolis an edge for now. Its limited track record in the country and lack of adequate scale are issues as well. &ldquo;This is a very domestic-driven business. Clearly, PVR&rsquo;s domain knowledge counts. Property owners need a strong tenant, and for that they would go to an Inox or PVR. Cinepolis doesn&rsquo;t have that kind of pull,&rdquo; says Roy.</p>\n<p class="p3">For his part, Bijli feels there&rsquo;s plenty of room for everyone and PVR will be adding screens both organically and through acquisitions. &ldquo;We believe there&rsquo;s huge potential for us to grow. We are targeting 1,000 screens in 48 months and we&rsquo;ll close at 450 this year. Inorganic growth could speed it up even faster,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;New mall development is going to be very slow in the next three to four years. But PVR has already tied up a lot of space,&rdquo; adds Roy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">And while occupancy rates have increased from 27% in FY11 to 35% in FY13, the company is working hard to ensure those numbers stay up. It&rsquo;s already increased the number of shows, from 4-4.3 per day per screen about five years ago to 5.7 currently; this will further rise and peak at 6, says the management. Promotions such as the one where ticket prices for all shows are reduced to Rs 75 every Thursday also help bring in theatre-goers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Also, PVR&rsquo;s advertising revenue per screen is expected to get a big fillip, given its clout. The company had consolidated advertising revenues of Rs 86 crore in FY13, with national advertisers contributing 70-80%. &ldquo;Given its bargaining power, the management plans to significantly increase consolidated ad revenue per screen over the next two years,&rdquo; states the Motilal Oswal Securities report. &ldquo;More importantly, given its high footfalls, 25% Bollywood box office market share and 35% Hollywood box office market share among multiplex theatres, PVR stands to gain significant bargaining power in terms of film hire charges,&rdquo; it further adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Currently, we are at the peak of our debt. In the coming years, the debt levels will start coming down" - Nitin Sood, CFO, PVR</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Analysts expect PVR revenues to grow at a CAGR of 47% over FY13-15, driven by consolidation of the Cinemax acquisition and aggressive opening of new screens. Its consolidated PAT, too, has registered healthy growth &mdash; from Rs 32 lakh in FY11 to Rs 44.3 crore in FY13, and is set to grow at a CAGR of 49% over FY13-15. All the expansion and acquisitions have resulted in a debt burden of over Rs 620 crore, but the management is not losing sleep over it. &ldquo;Currently we are at the peak of our debt. In the coming years, the debt levels will start coming down. The entire capex of Rs 120-130 crore for the next year is to be met through internal accruals,&rdquo; says Sood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Looks like Bijli has enough on his plate as PVR heads for its next milestone.

Given that in the past a majority of M&amp;As have failed to deliver on their promised synergies and, instead, impacted shareholder return, the market seems to be viewing the biggest-ever domestic pharma M&amp;A with scepticism. &ldquo;In the past, we have observed that large M&amp;As have taken longer than expected time to realise synergies (the Zydus Cadila-Biochem acquisition is a clear example),&rdquo; mentions Alok Dalal of Motilal Oswal.</p>\n<p class="p3">The biggest grouse seems to be over the seemingly expensive valuation that Torrent has paid and also that it will end with a levered balance sheet. As for Elder, the sale has effectively left it with practically nothing on its plate, except for reducing its leverage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Not surprisingly, then, since the deal was announced on December 13, the share price of Torrent sank from around Rs 500 level to Rs 480, and that of Elder has fallen from Rs 325 to Rs 268 within a week.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>A new formulation- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Elder Pharma sold its branded formulations business, which accounted for 95% of its revenues, to Torrent for Rs 2,004 crore. While the company doesn&rsquo;t disclose its branded formulations business revenue, analysts estimate that these brands bring in around Rs 500 crore, valuing the deal at four times its revenue. &ldquo;A valuation of 3.3X-4X FY13 sales in our opinion appears to be steep,&rdquo; adds Dalal of Motilal Oswal. The sale entails transfer of 30 brands across women&rsquo;s healthcare, pain management and dietary supplement categories. Post sell-off, the residual businesses of anti-infectives, exports and in-licensed products are not expected to fetch the lucrative margins the branded products did. Since no earnings estimates are available, the stock, which trades at 7X its FY13 consolidated earnings, is likely to see a further de-rating with the most profitable part of its business being sold.</p>\n<p class="p3">For Torrent, the deal will catapult its ranking to 12<sup>th</sup> place from the current 17<sup>th</sup> in a highly fragmented domestic drug market, according to IMS Health data. But the buyout will bloat its debt from the current Rs 913 crore to Rs 2,600 crore by FY15 as the company plans to raise over Rs 1,000-1,200 crore in fresh debt and fund the rest with internal accruals. As a result, debt-equity is expected to be around 1.30X from nil, while the acquisition is expected to be EPS-accretive only in the third year.

(224, 20, '', 'Hobson''s choice', '<p class="p1">If all goes according to plan, power customers of north Delhi will soon be able to choose their electricity supplier. And when that happens, after Mumbai, north Delhi will be the second region in the country that will have more than one supplier of electricity to residents of the region. In other words, there will be competition in the retail power supply business, which to date is a monopoly structure &mdash; there is only one distributor of electricity to retail customers even though the law allows for competition in this space.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">This paradigm regime change is on the anvil, thanks to a bold step being initiated by the power ministry to amend the Electricity Act and separate the business of wires and retail supply or what is called &ldquo;separation of carriage and content&rdquo;.</p>\n<p class="p4">Except for Mumbai, be it Delhi or any other state, currently the wires and supply business is under one operator/company. And if there has to be competition, the competing company will have to set up its own network in a distribution zone and gain customers.</p>\n<p class="p4">What the new amendments to the Act propose is to do away with this structure and have only one company operating the wires business and many companies involved in supply of electricity to consumers using the wires or the distribution network of that one company. In other words, the activity of distribution is being redefined and being limited to operating (distribution) wires alone while retail supply will be handled by other players.</p>\n<p class="p4">Simply put, there will be one distribution network being used by multiple players to supply electricity and offer choice to consumers. The amendments further allow the supplier to sublet this to other suppliers (such as franchisees).</p>\n<p class="p4">Confirming the initiative of the Centre, Ashok Lavasa, additional secretary in the ministry of power, says, &ldquo;Yes, this amendment [of separation of wires and supply] is one among the many amendments being considered by the government.&rdquo; These amendments have been initiated in consultation with the state regulators and have now been sent to states for their feedback. To many, this move taken by the Centre &mdash; which is under fire for policy paralysis &mdash; to amend the Act can be a game changer in the power sector, especially in the distribution space that has remained dormant for a long time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Praveer Sinha, chief executive officer and executive director,&nbsp;Tata&nbsp;Power Delhi Distribution, confidently declares that the company is ready for the regime change. &ldquo;Our distribution company [in north Delhi] is probably the best prepared to introduce the separation of wires and content. We can do it within one year of change in law.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Why the change?</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">On paper, the Electricity Act (section 14) allows for competition in power distribution. This doesn&rsquo;t require any state government initiative and can be done by the power regulator by issuing a licence to firms willing to take up power distribution in a specified area.</p>\n<p class="p4">Under the current regime, the only caveat is that the new distribution company will have to set up its own distribution network and can&rsquo;t piggyback on the existing distribution firm&rsquo;s network. But till end-2013, no company had come forward to set up a parallel distribution network and allow consumers to choose. The concept of competition remained only on paper.</p>\n<p class="p4">Based on the current provisions of law, almost 10 years after the Electricity Act was enacted, Essar Projects put in an application a few months back with the Haryana power regulator to supply electricity in the Gurgaon district. This is the first application to enter power distribution by setting up a parallel network and if the regulator nod is in place before the proposed amendment to the Act, then Gurgaon will be the second city to have dual suppliers of electricity.</p>\n<p class="p4">While executives from Essar refused to comment on the company&rsquo;s proposal, the company plans to set up its own distribution network for the entire city involving capex of Rs 1,500 crore spread over five years. Essar will procure power from its own stations at a rate of Rs 5.19/unit to Rs 5.8/unit and sell to consumers in Gurgaon.</p>\n<p class="p4">While Essar&rsquo;s proposal is pending, it is understood that GMR has also recently moved an application with the Andhra power regulator to supply electricity to areas near its international airport in Hyderabad. GMR executives didn&rsquo;t want to comment on their proposal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Pending the amendments to the Act being enacted, are these green shoots of competition in distribution? As Vinayak Chatterjee, chairman of Feedback Infra, says, &ldquo;This is a market waiting to happen.&rdquo; The power distribution business has been so badly neglected that &ldquo;anything being done where the consumer benefits is good,&rdquo; says Anil Sardana, managing director, Tata Power.</p>\n<p class="p4">Having said that, the jury is still out on whether Essar&rsquo;s proposal will see the light of day, especially since the present condition of having to put up a parallel network for competition is going to be done away with. After all, many experts see the provision of parallel network as an anomaly in the law in the first place.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>"It [setting up parallel networks] is capital intensive and a waste of resources" - Vinayak Chatterjee, chairman, Feedback Infra</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">Setting up parallel networks has its costs. &ldquo;It is capital intensive and a waste of resources&rdquo; says Chatterjee. In other words, a consumer, in order to avail his choice, has to pay for two networks. Apart from issues of getting permissions for right of way to lay down cables and transformers from the local government alongside an existing distribution network, Sinha says that there are also likely to be issues on land acquisition, making the proposition of setting up a parallel network a high-risk one.</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Still Life</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">What happened over the past decade in power distribution? For Delhi and Odisha, the process is in the hands of state governments. Under the corporatisation scheme of electricity boards, generation and transmission were spun off as distinct businesses and distribution was taken over by state-owned distribution companies (discoms).&nbsp; Discoms were formed for a certain geographical region, with each discom being responsible for power supply to consumers in that zone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Unbundling was the first step to the reform process, says VS Ailawadi, former chairman, Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission. Almost all states stopped at unbundling, which is why, according to area-wise operations, while 96% is in government control, 4% is in private hands (including Ahmedabad, Surat, Mumbai, Odisha and Delhi, all of which had private operators before the Act).</p>\n<p class="p4">After Delhi, even the concept of privatising distribution by handing over assets has been shelved as this was viewed as moving from state monopoly to a private monopoly &mdash; the latter being a more controversial move. In simpler terms, after unbundling, distribution reforms came to a standstill and this situation persists to date, despite the law allowing for competition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Even in Delhi, which was the last state to have privatised distribution, there is only one distributor for each of the zones. This status quo in distribution was politically suitable as the objective of distribution reforms at the state level had nothing to do with competition. Apart from technical and operational difficulties in having competition with parallel networks, one of the main benchmarks used to consider performance of discoms is their initiative to cut down aggregate technical and distribution losses. This was the reform objective. In some cities, these losses are over 60%. And the overall losses at the distribution end has already crossed Rs 2 lakh crore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">In other words, the cornerstone of distribution reforms was to improve billing and collection efficiency as well as ensure proper supply to consumers. For this objective, even in the Delhi model, privatisation was one of the options. But the Delhi model ended with Delhi. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">With privatisation being a no-go for political reasons, states started adopting the next best option of distribution reforms through the franchisee model in some circles of their discoms. In this model, cities or particular zones are bid out to companies to undertake distribution of electricity on behalf of the distribution company. While the ownership rests with the distribution company, the service of supply of electricity and collection of bills is that of the franchisee. The distribution company calls for bids from franchisee companies on the basis of revenues they offer to the discom. As for the franchisee company, anything above the guaranteed revenue to the discom is profit. Agra, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Jalgaon and Bhiwandi are just some of the examples where the incumbent discom has outsourced the activity of distribution of electricity to improve efficiency in a city.</p>\n<p class="p4">According to the Sunglu committee report, the experience of franchisees has been encouraging. In Bhiwandi, Maharashtra, since Torrent took over as the franchisee for the city in January 2007, the aggregate technical and commercial (AT&amp;C) losses came down from 58% to 18% and collection efficiency improved from 68% to 100%.</p>\n<p class="p4">But, then, what is true of Bhiwandi is yet to be replicated in a city like Agra, where again Torrent Power is the distribution franchisee. Sources familiar with the Agra example say that the loss figures reported during the bid turned out to be much higher after the franchisee company took over in 2010.</p>\n<p class="p4">More recently, the incumbent government of Uttar Pradesh planned to hand over the cities of Varanasi, Meerut, Ghaziabad and Kanpur to franchisees, but the idea was dropped as there was opposition from the trade unions. And then there are examples of the other extreme situations where companies themselves are not too keen to take up franchisees while the state is willing to sublet. In Patna, Bihar, for instance, despite repeated tenders called by the Nitish Kumar government, there have been no takers for franchisees for power distribution.</p>\n<p class="p4">As things stand, the franchisee model for distribution reforms is far from being declared as a success story as results are yet to come out. Moreover, this model has been adopted in only a few cities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p8">&nbsp;<strong>Winds of change</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">With financial losses of distribution companies crossing over Rs 2 lakh crore, there was no way the sector could move forward as the power sector financial bailout package of last year highlighted. Something radical had to be done to the distribution sector and the Mumbai experience offered a way out. The Maharashtra power regulator, in 2008, allowed Tata Power to supply to customers in RInfra&rsquo;s circle using the latter&rsquo;s distribution or wires network.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">The reason? Tata Power, prior to the Electricity Act, already had a licence from the state government to distribute power and the law required the regulator to promote competition as open access was one of the main features of the Act.</p>\n<p class="p4">While this was challenged by RInfra, the Supreme Court in 2008 upheld the regulator&rsquo;s decision (despite the law requiring a parallel network to be set up by Tata Power). According to the apex court, the very concept of &ldquo;wheeling&rdquo; of electricity in the law allows companies (that are yet to put up their own parallel lines) to use existing networks on the payment of wheeling charges and payment of surcharge to distribute electricity.</p>\n<p class="p4">As soon as Tata Power became the second supplier of electricity in Mumbai, customers had choice. And, soon enough, some of them (including large consumers such as the airport) moved to Tata Power to source their power as it was cheaper. There was competition as the law required.</p>\n<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Such an arrangement in Mumbai triggered thinking among all the regulators whether this could be replicated in other states as well. Legal opinion on the issue suggested that the Mumbai model was a one-off since Tata Power already had a pre-existing licence to distribute power in the island city. Hence, the law in its present form still required companies wanting to enter distribution to set up their own network. Moreover, it was suggested that amendments to the law were needed to have a separate wires operator and retail service provider.</span></p>\n<p class="p4">With the backing of power regulators, the Centre took up the initiative and proposed amendments to the Electricity Act to separate the wires and supply businesses. The experience of Mumbai had to be replicated and the way out was to have a common carrier or an independent wires company that would allow multiple players to access its network and reach out to consumers. This was the way to introduce competition. But an amendment is just the first baby step towards having full-fledged competition across the country. Experts feel that it would not only require bold decisions to be taken by the states, it would also take many years to move to this paradigm shift across the country.</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Baby steps before quantum leap</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">The separation of carriage and content leading to competition in the retail market is not going to be achieved overnight and according to the forum of regulators themselves, this initiative has to be carefully planned out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Consider this: once the amendment goes through, all future supply licensees or retailers will have to depend on the network of the incumbent discom &mdash; which are mostly state owned. Not only are our distribution networks under-invested but they are nowhere near any modern network that can handle multiple suppliers tapping into such a network. And, as Sardana asks, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point in having multiple suppliers when there are brownouts because of faulty distribution networks?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>"What''s the point in having multiple suppliers when there are brownouts due to faulty distribution networks?" - Anil Sardana, managing director, Tata Power</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">Further, one of the biggest issues of introducing competition through separation of the wires and supply businesses is that of cross-subsidy, says Kameshwar Rao, leader, power and mining, PricewaterhouseCoopers. In countries that have adopted this model (including in sectors other than power, such as the railways in the UK), the customers are charged full cost, he adds. In India, there is a major difference between cost of supply and realisation from segments such as agriculture.</p>\n<p class="p4">That said, the rules of the distribution business don&rsquo;t allow for cherry picking. Rao says that the new distribution licensee cannot choose any area of their choice or select customers. It cannot be an industrial belt or a lucrative housing society but has to be a revenue district or a municipal council/corporation of urban areas falling within a particular discom&rsquo;s area.</p>\n<p class="p4">Tata&nbsp;Power Delhi Distribution&rsquo;s Sinha, though, is confident that competition can happen in north Delhi in a year&rsquo;s time but is sceptical on whether the change will happen universally immediately. &ldquo;Without 100% metering, there is no way this new model will be successful,&rdquo; he says, and adds that competition will happen in pockets that move towards this endeavour.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Even if the amendment to law comes into effect, sources say that a two-stage initiative spread over years is being contemplated to bring in competition in the distribution business through segregation of the wires and supply businesses. Under the first phase that can last anywhere up to three years or more, the existing discom&rsquo;s wires and retail supply business will be spun off in two different companies through proper transfer schemes and separation of employees. There will be separate licences for both the businesses defining their roles.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>"Without 100% metering, there is no way this new model [of distribution business] will be sucessful" - Praveer Sinha, CEO and ED, Tata Power Delhi Distribution</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">The wires company will continue to remain a monopoly with the past financial liabilities of the discom being transferred to the wires company. In the second phase, which can spread over six years, also the most tricky phase, states will have to be on board to eliminate losses and remove cross subsidies. &ldquo;In order to have competition in retail, one has to start on a clean slate,&rdquo; says Ailawadi.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>"In order to have competition in retail, one has to start on a clean slate" - VS Ailawadi, ex-chairman, Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">Under the plans for competition in retail, the idea may well be kicked off with pilot schemes where retail competition is introduced in small pockets of a discom. The discom, on its part, while retaining the wires business, could sublet the operations and maintenance part of the wires business to ensure the network is being modernised and is kept running. Once amendments are through, even a company like Tata Power, which handles distribution in north Delhi, would have to split its wires and supply businesses. The wires business of Tata Power can be used by other companies to supply customers. Would Tata Power stand to lose, then? Not quite, says Sardana, adding that its retail business would be strong enough to retain customers.</p>\n<p class="p4">In other words, the incumbent Tata Power would have to go the extra mile to retain consumers and the new entrant would have to do better to attract consumers. This is a big change from the existing state of affairs of Hobson&rsquo;s choice. It has taken 10 years to act on the Electricity Act by which time the distribution business has slipped further into the abyss. But now change is on the anvil even though the road to reform is a long one.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">They say, why fix it if ain&rsquo;t broke. The converse analogy is, why fix it if it is already broken.

The ex-CEO of Adani Power first read that book as a student in 1981. &ldquo;Bachchan&rsquo;s first wife died after 10 years of marriage. He recited this line to Teji, who became his second wife, a while after they met. They hugged, cried and decided to get married,&rdquo; reveals Sharma. The poem had a deep impact on Sharma&rsquo;s life. &ldquo;It inspired me to write that &lsquo;sentiments without commitment are like words without meaning&rsquo;. This has since become the guiding principle of my life,&rdquo; he says. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Sharma has been writing poems, Urdu <em>ghazals</em> and <em>nazms</em> on subjects ranging from love, betrayal, nostalgia, longing and unemployment regularly for three decades now. The choice of topics is diverse, much in line with the happenings in his life. From going to primary school in a roofless building in Chakia village, Varanasi, to graduating from IIT Roorkee, and from corner offices at United Breweries, Alcatel, Videocon and Adani Power to giving it all up and adopting schools in Chakia, Sharma&rsquo;s life has come full circle.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Now, it is his Facebook page that buzzes with poetic activity. He reads some out loud &mdash; one verse views life from a negative perspective, another plays with brevity. Most of the poems revolve around hope and optimism, personality traits that Sharma himself possesses. His poetry transcends formats and flows from observation rather than experience. &ldquo;I wrote my first poem way back in 1978 on the issue of unemployment in the country. At Roorkee, I was the editor of the college magazine and actively pursued poetry. Today, I support the extra-curricular activities of IIT students, something not many stand up for,&rdquo; says Sharma.</p>\n<p class="p3">When he turned 50 in 2012, Sharma decided that he had had enough of his 13-14 years as CEO of different companies. He says he felt that something was missing in his life &mdash; a sense of wholeness. &ldquo;I quit my job and have since divided my life between my work on the boards of innovative firms, the four schools that I have adopted in Varanasi and the Prama Jyoti Foundation, my poetry and my spiritual learning with the Chinmaya Mission,&rdquo; says Sharma.</p>\n<p class="p3">How has his love for poetry influenced his work and professional life? Rather, has he observed any changes at all? Sharma doesn&rsquo;t see why the two should connect. &ldquo;Everything should stand on its own, be it poetry or work. I don&rsquo;t go looking for cross-subsidisation in the interests I pursue,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Sharma is now planning to get two volumes of his Hindi poems and <em>ghazals </em>published. While that is scheduled for later this year, he regularly reads ghazals for his YouTube audience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Sharma says writing poetry makes him feel refreshed and child-like; it has shaped a facet of his personality. &ldquo;I believe in taking people at face value. If you trust your fellow human beings and show confidence in their work, they feel empowered to do just about anything.&rdquo; He insists that a true pursuit of happiness is not possible. &ldquo;Happiness cannot be pursued.

Add vodka to the mix and you get a straight Cosmopolitan; substitute vodka with tequila and you get a classic Margarita. It works just as well with rum, whisky or even cognac. That&rsquo;s the message 27-year-old Alfred Cointreau from Angers, France, is spreading as he travels across the globe as heritage manager for the orange liqueur we are all familiar with but think nothing of substituting with a synthetic-tasting triple sec from the neighbourhood grocer.</p>\n<p class="p3">India&rsquo;s bar-hopping youth may be brand-conscious, but how particular are they about the ingredients in their cocktails or their prices? Hardly, I&rsquo;d say. And yet, let them compare the experience of using an ordinary triple sec and Cointreau as a mixer and they will definitely not mind paying extra for a &lsquo;premium&rsquo; cocktail, says Rajesh Grover, Remy Cointreau&rsquo;s India and Gulf marketing manager. He is confident about the youth&rsquo;s ability to signal the difference between an ordinary and premium cocktail.</p>\n<p class="p3">Though we&rsquo;re all familiar with Cointreau&rsquo;s square brown bottle, first created in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, we&rsquo;re not entirely sure what we like about it. But then we&rsquo;re suspicious of most liqueurs, preferring our drinks hard and masculine instead of mysterious and feminine.</p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s true that Cointreau was created keeping women in mind. Nearly 165 years ago, the Cointreau family had created a distillery where they experimented with fruits in alcohol. At that time, oranges were considered an exotic fruit and were exchanged as gifts over Christmas. So the peel of the precious fruit found itself being combined with 40% alcohol to create a clear liqueur &mdash; something of a sensation at the time &mdash; and a legend was born. Today, those bittersweet oranges (a combination of their peels is used in the making) are sourced from South America, Africa and Spain and the master distiller&rsquo;s job is made difficult by varying global climate changes as he prepares for the short and crisp distillation process using 96 proof alcohol and water.</p>\n<p class="p3">Fifteen million bottles of Cointreau are sold globally in a year, mostly as mixers, though it is possible to drink it neat (or almost neat &mdash; <em>see: Cointreau Classics</em>). And yet, none of the plagiarisers who have tried to copy the recipe and bottle have come close to decoding the drink. The answer does not lie in any secret ingredient, grins Alfred Cointreau, but in the selection of oranges, peels of which he has carried as samples from France.</p>\n<p class="p3">Why hasn&rsquo;t Cointreau experimented with other fruits? Because nothing else has worked as well. Cointreau Citrus &mdash; made using limes and lemons &mdash; was launched three years ago with disastrous results. The firm has since decided to stick with something the family has patented successfully. Sometimes, the secret of a good brand &mdash; like a good cocktail &mdash; lies in just one special ingredient. In Cointreau, they have found just that. <span class="s3"><br /></span></p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>&mdash;The author is a Delhi-based writer and curator</strong></p>', 'There''s a reason why cointreau has consistently topped the list of premium cocktail mixers', '17', '', 0, '', 'in-high-spirits-227', 222, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'In high spirits', 'There''s a reason why cointreau has consistently topped the list of premium cocktail mixers', '', '', '', 'Cointreau,Premium cocktail', 0, NULL, '2015-01-23 14:57:46', NULL, '2014-01-18', 0),

In early December, India-focused private equity firm Samara Capital bought out Network18&rsquo;s 72.5% stake in NewsWire18 for Rs 90 crore. The development wasn&rsquo;t a complete surprise since the Raghav Bahl-promoted Network18 has been exiting non-core businesses. Indeed, Bahl justified the deal saying, &ldquo;We are today a B2C group and that is the reason to exit a B2B business such as NewsWire18.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">But what prompted a PE fund to get into the #600-crore news terminals business, where NewsWire18&nbsp; (FY12 revenue: Rs 45 crore) is a low third in a market dominated by Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters? Paurush Roy, MD, Samara Capital, believes the information services market in India is at the cusp of significant growth. &ldquo;NewsWire18 is well positioned to capture this opportunity because of its understanding of the local market, customer centricity and a committed management team,&rdquo; he says. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">By now, the financial wire service must be used to being taken over by ambitious buyers. In its initial avatar, it was known as Bridge News until Crisil bought it over in 2001. It seemed a synergistic fit and Crisil announced plans of becoming an information services provider, selling financial news to clients. But it didn&rsquo;t work because, says an industry veteran, the necessary investments in terminals weren&rsquo;t made. &ldquo;There was very little idea about what to do with this business and Crisil MarketWire [or CMW, as it was called] was viewed as only an outsourced third-party news provider&rdquo;. After Crisil was taken over by S&amp;P, CMW was sold to Network18. Bahl, too, wanted to build on CMW&rsquo;s news and data platforms, with the objective of reaching out to its large institutional segment but as TV18 moved away from the B2B space, that didn&rsquo;t materialise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Can Samara succeed where others failed?

But the news terminals business is a cutthroat one &mdash; there&rsquo;s the overwhelming duopoly as well as the plethora of free (or nearly so) news sites on the web.

She scans listings online with an eye for things sold by itinerant travellers and on the move embassies, based on their location in Delhi and usernames. Misra, whose daughter is only three, is likely to have a few more years of spills and stains and does not want to splurge out on brand-new furniture. &ldquo;These deals online are the best. They are people with good taste who have used the furniture for a couple of years and you can buy it at a quarter of the price of a new one,&rdquo; she says. So far, in her quest for a sofa, she has ended up buying silk curtains, an oil-filled heater for winter and a nearly new set of learning toys. &ldquo;Even two years ago, if you had suggested that I buy used furniture, I would have thought you were insulting me,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Not anymore.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s true. Switch on the television and you are likely to run into an advertisement for Olx India or Quikr, two of the fastest growing online classified companies. &ldquo;More and more people now prefer online classifieds over the more traditional print classifieds. This is due to various factors. Online classifieds give you enhanced reach and faster responses. The ads are active and open for a long time and the cost of placing one is negligible, often free,&rdquo; says Amarjit Singh Batra, CEO, OLX India, the Argentina-based classifieds site that launched its operations in India in 2006. Since OLX unleashed its TV campaign in 2011, it has seen a 2.4 times rise in traffic.</p>\n<p class="p3">Quikr, the Indian startup that made its debut in 2008, has about 5 million listings on its platform and claims nearly 24 million individuals and small businesses across 83 cities access the site every month to sell, buy, rent or find products and services in a variety of categories. OLX has around 8 million unique visitors and enjoys 35% market share. &ldquo;There are two sides to every transaction. The buyer and the seller usually come from different walks of life. For example, a person buying a used car is from a different demographic than the person selling it. Online classifieds&rsquo; job is to help these two people meet when the chances of them meeting without a market such as this are quite low,&rdquo; says Pranay Chuhet, co-founder and CEO, Quikr. Apart from the usual suspects of automobiles and electronics, online classified sites are a treasure trove of products and services. You can buy anything from a pair of shoes that have been bought on an impulse to security gadgets for your home. The listings are especially strong for items that people are unlikely to use for a long period of time. This means things such as baby cots and toys, costumes for theme parties and exercise equipment can be yours at the click of a button and a couple of phone calls. Some are almost new, some are slightly used, but all are super cheap, when compared with a brand new piece.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In fact, some of the new things also have their genesis in these sites. Javed Alim runs a furniture store in Delhi&rsquo;s Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road. He starts his day, he says, by scanning the listings of furniture in these sites. Lots of people sell furniture in very decent condition; Alim buys them, spruces them up &mdash; changes upholstery or fixes some defects &mdash; and sells them in his showroom. &ldquo;Or we just use the basic frame. Quite often, our own furniture comes back to us, we fix it and sell it for new,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Globally, the classifieds market is pegged at $100 billion. The size of India&rsquo;s online classifieds industry is about Rs 1,100 crore, which is expected to grow to about Rs 3,100 crore by 2016, implying a CAGR of 22%, according to a report by Edelweiss. But unlike in the US where Craiglist is the biggest classifieds site, in India there are dedicated websites for each vertical. (<em>See: A rush of clicks</em>) India has a growing number of internet users but the number of people willing to transact online is low. People are worried about what they are buying; they would like to see it, touch it and, with vehicles, take it for a testdrive. Since the actual transaction listed on these online classifieds sites takes place offline, it gives users a sense of comfort and familiarity. Chennai-based Sulekha, for instance, enables 25 million transactions a year and receives over 23 million visits a month. &ldquo;We are evolving into a need-based site,&rdquo; says Satya Prabhakar, founder and CEO, who claims the company has consistently been operationally profitable and has grown in excess of 70% over the last two years.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>In plain sight</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Posting an ad is often free to the user. However, if you want your ad to stand out, it helps if you pay a little money. So, most online classifieds companies channelise a revenue stream from what are called premium listings &mdash; where the user has paid some money so that his ad is displayed prominently. Over and above this, since these sites generate large traffic, online advertisements are also a source of cash flow. Sulekha, which claims to have over 100,000 paid listings, maintains that free listings will be the way forward. Batra of OLX agrees and points out that the core site will always be free and that the site&rsquo;s current monetisation avenue is only the text ads provided by Google. Globally, OLX offers featured listings that allows users to get prominent placement. It however, has yet to introduce the feature in India. In contrast, Quikr charges money from advertisers and also earns through featured listings. Recently, it introduced premium listings in Mumbai, Gurgaon and Pune.</p>\n<p class="p3">While all sites spend money on developing technology that keeps the site clean and maintains the quality of listings, going forward, the key differentiator is on the mobile. Quikr has a missed call feature, where a user gives a missed call on a 1-800 number. A representative calls you back and takes down your requirement, then feeds you relevant listings. This captures the ease, convenience and reach of online classifieds, without you having to go online at all. So if a user has given a missed call and said he was looking to, say, buy a used Hyundai Santro car, the representative would scan the listing for the car in the region and feed these to him. If you have listed to sell your Santro and paid for a premium listing, yours will be one of the first responses he receives. He e-mails you, you meet and if you agree, shake over the deal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While some focus on more direct methods of sale, the likes of Sulekha prefer the traditional route. &ldquo;Our growth is led by advertising, coupons and a strong focus on e-commerce,&rdquo; says Prabhakar.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Next is what</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Now that online classifieds has helped us break our reluctance to buy used goods online, the next step is to make it easier. The real action is likely to shift to mobile phones. India is now what is called a mobile-first economy. This means that newcomers to the web are accessing it first on their smartphones. Mobile internet is growing at a much faster pace. &ldquo;This makes mobile apps a key lever for acquiring internet users,&rdquo; agrees Batra.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">He adds that mobile internet users account for over 50% of internet accessing population and mobile traffic has surpassed web traffic. With increased mobile penetration, it has become easy to reach out to new users who rely on their handsets to browse the internet. Currently, mobile users account for 5% of the traffic on OLX and the majority of this traffic is from its app, which also runs banner ads on the top and bottom of each page. In contrast, Quickr&rsquo;s Chuhet does not view the mobile as a monetisable avenue. &ldquo;In the long run, you create more value by getting more users to post content. In the short run, the mobile would be about engaging users as opposed to making money,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>Directing traffic</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">While OLX refused to reveal its revenue numbers, clearly there is a valid business proposition in its model. The faith shown by venture capitalists is testament to this. In fact, Nexus Capital Partners, which had invested $5 million in OLX in May 2009, exited the very next year when South African media giant, Naspers, bought the site for $100 million. Suvir Sujan, co-founder and managing director of Nexus, was quoted in <em>VCCircle</em> saying that the firm had made &ldquo;multiples on its investment&rdquo;. Similarly, last May, Quikr raised around $32 million (Rs 176 crore) in its fifth round of funding from investors such as Warburg Pincus, Matrix Partners India, Norwest Venture Partners and eBay Inc. While exit is still some time away, Chuhet is clear that his priority is to scale up the business. &ldquo;You can throttle a good thing, and just worry about getting revenue in too soon. We want to have that room for breathing. The opportunity for someone such as Quikr is humongous in India, especially because pure online commerce has not taken off the way it should have,&rdquo; Chuhet had said in a media interview.</p>\n<p class="p3">And that change is happening for sure. When Jagan Rao shifted out of his parents&rsquo; home in November, he found rare copies of comics that he used to collect as a child &mdash; Amar Chitra Kathas and others.

(232, 16, '', 'Secure plastic', '<p class="p1">When 30-year-old Nidhi Singh, a human resource recruiter with a leading telecom company in Mumbai, wanted a credit card to supplement her emergency travel funds for a trip abroad, she was surprised and dismayed to find that none of the banks would give her one &mdash; she had a low CIBIL (Credit Information Bureau) score, the rating of her creditworthiness based on her financial history. The culprits were a late payment on a personal loan and a one-time settlement on an earlier credit card. So it was that banks viewed Singh as a risky customer even though she had a secure job and steady earnings. Customers like Singh can now get &lsquo;secured cards&rsquo; linked to their fixed deposits from leading banks like State Bank of India (SBI), which launched them in tier 2 and tier 3 cities in September, ICICI Bank and DCB (rolled out a couple of months ago). Axis Bank and HDFC Bank, too, offer FD-linked cards.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;A secured card is a good way for customers to redeem past credit mistakes,&rdquo; points out Arun Thukral, chairman, CIBIL. All that&rsquo;s needed is a KYC form, a picture and an FD receipt. &ldquo;With this card, we can expand the credit card customer base to include those without a steady income stream such as stock brokers, SME and micro business owners and homemakers,&rdquo; explains Abhijit Bose, head of retail assets and strategic alliances, DCB Bank.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;It really is simple. A customer opens a fixed deposit (usually upwards of Rs 20,000) with a bank and gets a card, the credit limit for which is set at around 80-90% of the FD&rsquo;s value. The card is valid for the FD&rsquo;s duration and it functions like any other credit card. &ldquo;The bank only adjusts the outstanding amount owed against an FD if a customer turns delinquent [defaults payments permanently despite reminders and due processes],&rdquo; says Kadambi Narhari, CEO, SBI Cards. The SBI Cards portfolio has about 10% secured cardholders. Customers continue to earn FD rates of interest whereas banks typically charge lower monthly interest rates on them &mdash; SBI, for instance, charges 1.95% interest on FD-linked cards as opposed to 2.25% on its &lsquo;regular&rsquo; plastic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">After the credit crisis in 2008, banks hit the break on credit card issuances that hit a high of 27 million cardholders in 2007-2008 &mdash; defaults hit a high of 20-22% and banks like ICICI, one of the most aggressive issuer of cards in India, had to clean up their portfolio. By FY12, the same had come down to 17 million as per RBI data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The secured card is usually the first card that one takes in the US, a developed market for credit cards, to start building one&rsquo;s credit history. Indian banks are now pitching the same to clients with low CIBIL scores, over-the-counter, or on email. Various banks, like SBI and DCB, have trained scouts on market visits and ICICI began offering instant FD-linked cards to net banking customers only recently. Meanwhile, Nidhi Singh has availed a secured card and is set to have a worry-free trip.&nbsp;</p>', 'Credit cards linked to fixed deposits are good for customers and even better for banks', '29', '', 0, '', 'secure-plastic-232', 227, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Secure plastic', 'Credit cards linked to fixed deposits are good for customers and even better for banks', '', '', '', 'Secured credit card,Fixed deposit,CIBIL,SBI', 0, NULL, '2015-01-23 17:09:43', '2015-01-23 17:14:26', '2013-01-19', 0),
(233, 16, '', 'Solid high ground', '<p class="p1">American statesman Benjamin Franklin, in the best tradition of timeless aphorists, surely didn&rsquo;t have private equity (PE) funds or the Indian real estate market in mind when he sagely uttered, &ldquo;An investment in knowledge pays the best interest&rdquo;. But he could well have been talking about them as I found out while working on this story: domestic real estate PE funds that invested with knowledge of the local property market made money; the rest are still trying to figure out what went wrong. Look at the line-up: only domestic funds such as Kotak Realty Fund, Indiareit Fund Advisors, ASK Property Investment Advisors and HDFC Property Fund have made good money. Foreign PE funds such as Tishman Speyer, JP Morgan Chase and Lehman Brothers have made very little or no money. Why did some funds then, perform better than the others?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">We have to go back to the heydays of 2005 to understand this, for that&rsquo;s when the government first allowed 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in the real estate sector via the automatic route. International and domestic PE funds couldn&rsquo;t get into real estate fast enough back then. It was a mad rush characterised by investments in just about everything from townships to special economic zones (SEZs). FDI in India&rsquo;s superheated real estate market jumped 80 times from Rs 171 crore in 2005 to Rs 13,586 crore in 2010. Investments of foreign funds peaked in 2007, when they pumped in around $5.73 billion compared to $4.05 billion put in by domestic funds. The slowdown of 2008-09 was unexpected and ugly. Buyers backed off and projects that looked promising suddenly had no takers. The end result: many foreign funds got mired in delayed or unapproved projects, or into neck-deep arbitration with developers. For instance, the Indian arm of New York-based AIG Global Real Estate has sent a legal notice to Bengaluru-based real estate company RMZ Corp over an equal joint venture project in Hyderabad. The bone of contention is AIG wants RMZ to exit the project because it has failed in developing it. AIG had invested Rs 350 crore in the project, which got delayed because the joint venture partners could not agree over whether the project should be residential or mixed use. In the National Capital Region, Citi Property Investors (now owned by Apollo Global Management) and JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co have filed separate arbitration proceedings against BPTP, claiming that the developer has failed to provide an exit for their investments. JP Morgan has invested Rs 241 crore in the company in two tranches. Citi had invested Rs 322.5 crore in the company and Rs 399 crore in the company&rsquo;s projects.</p>\n<p class="p3">Analysts say foreign funds made huge mistakes because they underestimated the byzantine Indian real estate market. Very few foreign funds, such as Morgan Stanley Real Estate or Xander Group, which have local fund managers as heads, understood the risk of land aggregation, approvals and execution. They bought into any growth story that was sold to them by real estate developers. New York-based Vornado Realty Trust for instance, invested #315 crore in Delhi-based real estate developer, Uppal Group&rsquo;s 269-acre SEZ in Gurgaon. The fund is yet to exit its investment. It is the same problem with Citi Property Investors, the real estate unit of Citigroup, which bought a 40% stake in five SEZ companies of real estate firm BPTP for Rs 399 crore. There has been no exit so far. They learnt the hard way that they had to invest in people on the ground to succeed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">As things played out, foreign funds lost their nerve and took a backseat by the time the real estate market started recovering from the slowdown in 2009. Domestic funds were made of sterner and smarter stuff &mdash; that same year, they invested $665 million, for the first time far exceeding the $183 million sunk by American and other overseas funds.&nbsp; Sanjay Dutt, managing director of real estate consultancy Cushman &amp; Wakefield, has an explanation for this. He says that most funds that came to India were new. &ldquo;Many people who committed to India at that time were opportunistic funds with a short-term view, looking to make a quick return on their investments. As one looks back now, the winners have all been local fund managers,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Staying grounded&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Kotak Realty Fund (KRF), in particular, has been a trailblazer. The fund is one of few that have consistently managed to return money to investors. KRF, which was established in May 2005, is headed by S Sriniwasan, an ex-investment banker. Dutt says that experience has clearly helped. &ldquo;Srini does not have a real estate background but his more than a decade&rsquo;s experience in investment banking must have helped him identify the right opportunities.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Aiding Srini along this very profitable journey has been V Hari Krishna, director, KRF, who has 15 years of experience in real estate, having worked at consultancy firms Jones Lang La Salle and CB Richard Ellis. Krishna says, &ldquo;Our definition of a worthy investment is something that we can exit easily,&rdquo; And exit it has. In the last three years, KRF has exited 15 of its 33 investments, with an average return of 27%. The fund has returned a handsome $325 million to its investors. Krishna says prudent investing has saved the fund from losing money, and goes on to add, &ldquo;We never went by any fads like SEZs or townships, which ruled the market during its peak.&rdquo; The fund also stayed away from secondary cities, sticking instead to the top metros.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Deals at KRF are mostly structured as secured transactions with elements of debt and equity, and no deal is done if the internal rate of return (IRR) is below 22%. CEO Sriniwasan says this has helped the fund have a significant say in project execution. &ldquo;We structure our investments as part equity and part non-convertible debentures,&rdquo; he says of the process he has followed for four years now. &ldquo;Cash flows from residential sales repay interest on debentures and other things. We pioneered such deals in the market and a number of peers are now following a similar strategy. It gives me and my team tremendous pride and satisfaction that we have led others.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;KRF has $765 million funds under management and is now looking to raise another $200-300 million from domestic investors in what would be its fifth round of fund raising. It plans on parking the bulk of this money in residential projects, following a narrow investment strategy that offers easy exits. &ldquo;Exits in residential projects self-liquidate when sales happen,&rdquo; points out Krishna. &ldquo;Commercial property is more difficult to exit. It has to be first leased and then sold to either third-party investors or buyers. Moreover, there is no REIT market in India to list the property.&rdquo; A REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) is an entity that raises money from investors to own and manage property. Its shares are traded and the bulk of its revenue comes from property rent. It helps that a good chunk of Kotak&rsquo;s 28-member team has a real estate or construction sector background. &ldquo;We have had the same team of experienced people for the last five or six years,&rdquo; says Sriniwasan. &ldquo;In a business where you have to stay married to an investment for a couple of years, continuity of management matters.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Not that there haven&rsquo;t been mistakes but, &ldquo;We course corrected in a couple of investments when things went wrong,&rdquo; admits Sriniwasan. For instance, when a project was not meeting its deadline, Kotak restructured the deal and invited another realtor to develop the land. In another instance, the team expected to rent out a property in the Delhi-NCR region, completed just before the Lehman crisis hit the market, at #37 per sq ft per month. Then, the market hit rock bottom. &ldquo;We sat down with the developer and decided that, instead of keeping the property idle, we would lease it out at #30 per sq ft per month,&rdquo; Sriniwasan explains. &ldquo;By doing so, we were able to meet our interest and debt obligations.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">KRF&rsquo;s secret sauce, clearly, is its ability to rein in developers. &ldquo;The real estate sector is an undisciplined industry,&rdquo; Krishna says. &ldquo;It needs people like us to bring in discipline.&rdquo; Kotak has local people on the ground breathing down the necks of developers to make sure its projects are on schedule. &ldquo;We keep a close eye as the focus is on getting the developer to deliver.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>Same to same</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Being in sync with market realities has also helped Indiareit Fund Advisors and ASK Property Investment Advisors. Quiz the funds on the reasons for their success and their answers sound uncannily similar to KRF&rsquo;s, which maintains that &ldquo;it is all about finding the right partner in the right location at the right time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Amit Bhagat, managing director and CEO of ASK Property Investment Advisors, says finding a quality partner is half the job done. &ldquo;We always look for a quality partner because it is his intent and his capability that will decide the return on the investment.&rdquo; Bhagat says the quest is to find an impeccable partner who respects every stakeholder, be it his buyer, investor or lender. &ldquo;We look for qualities such as whether he has rewarded any private equity investor in the past,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;It was not possible to verify this five years back because there was no investment history, but now we can do that&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">ASK is a rare fund &mdash; in March 2012, the IRR on its investment in ATS Infrastructure&rsquo;s Noida project stood at an impressive 56%, and it gave a fantastic return of 2.45 times (Rs 121 crore on an investment of Rs 50 crore) in less than two-and-a-half years. This was one of the seven projects in which ASK invested from its initial fund of Rs 326 crore. It raised a second fund of Rs 1,000 crore, most of it domestically (and many of them repeat investors) in June 2012.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;&ldquo;You need local knowledge,&rdquo; agrees Indiareit CEO Khushru Jijina, who lays the blame for the failure of other funds to the lack of it. Indiareit has regional offices in Delhi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad to have local people on the ground. &ldquo;In India you have land issues, title issues&hellip;it is not easy getting money out of this country unless you understand the system well,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>More local gospel&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Shobit Agarwal, managing director, Jones Lang La Salle, agrees that a deeper understanding of the local market sets apart the winners from the losers. &ldquo;Domestic fund managers operating in India understand the challenges of doing business in India; they understand that chief ministers change, approvals take longer than expected and that, therefore, they need to budget for it,&rdquo; says Agarwal. &ldquo;Domestic funds have very robust underwriting models and the right acumen. Sriniwasan, for instance, is a very old hand. Jijina has been in business for 20 years. You can&rsquo;t sell a pipe-dream to these people.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Indiareit certainly didn&rsquo;t buy into any dream. The fund has exited eight projects since 2008 in addition to exiting three funds, with an average return of 27-28% on its investments. It has returned around Rs 1,340 crore to its investors and now manages Rs 3,700 crore of funds. Indiareit also did not touch long gestation projects such as hotels, office space or malls. The fund invested purely in residential projects with little or no debt. While there is no one favourite transaction, a formula that worked well for the fund is its investments in Mumbai. A large part of the fund&rsquo;s portfolio was in the city, despite it being considered an overpriced real estate market. The thinking was that in such a land-scarce city, there will always be scope for prices to move up. The strategy did work, considering that many of Indiareit&rsquo;s successful exits such as from two projects of Ariisto Group, a residential project at Santacruz and a mixed-use project at Goregaon, have been in Mumbai.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Indiareit, too, keeps a tight leash on its partner, to make sure the invested money is used well. Not only does the fund never give cash out to its partner, it makes sure its partners have invested some amount of &lsquo;hurt money&rsquo; in the project, so that the developer hurts, too, if something goes wrong. &ldquo;If I like a project, I would still like to have some ring fencing so that money doesn&rsquo;t get transferred to another project,&rdquo; says Jijina. &ldquo;We may even demand escrowing of cash flows from a project. We have clauses that say that if a developer doesn&rsquo;t perform in a particular manner, we can take over the project.&rdquo; While Indiareit has not taken over any project as of now, Jijina says the fund will not stop short of doing so if the need arises. &ldquo;You will see some action happening soon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We could take over some project.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Arun Natarajan, founder, Venture Intelligence, a firm that tracks private equity investment in India, says the real estate private equity landscape in India is now completely dominated by domestic funds. &ldquo;This has more to do with the FY09 global recession, when foreign funds went away and never came back. A few funds were asked to withdraw from private equity investment by the US regulatory authorities,&rdquo; says Natarajan. &ldquo;In their absence, domestic funds consolidated their position.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Domestic funds have a clear edge now because of their rapport with developers and lessons learnt from earlier investments. But Natarajan says this could change. &ldquo;Foreign funds such as Blackstone have become more aggressive, so we could see more foreign funds returning to the Indian market.&rdquo; And when this does happen, it will be interesting to see whether domestic funds hold their fort. Kotak&rsquo;s Sriniwasan believes his fund will continue its good run. &ldquo;At various points in time there will be new opportunities and challenges. Given our skill sets, we will always be able to provide customised financing solutions. The way we run our business and our speed of decision making will give us the edge.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>', 'Domestic funds have made money hand over fist, playing the Indian realty market much better than their foreign counterparts ', '30', '', 0, '', 'solid-high-ground-233', 228, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Solid high ground', 'Domestic funds have made money hand over fist, playing the Indian realty market much better than their foreign counterparts ', '', '', '', 'Indian realty PE funds,Kotak Realty Fund,Indiareit Fund Advisors,ASK Property Investment Advisors,HDFC Property Fund', 0, NULL, '2015-01-23 17:16:48', '2015-01-23 17:54:48', '2013-01-19', 0),

(235, 20, '', 'Running out of turn', '<p class="p1">Are you someone who believes private sector banks are always better than public sector ones &mdash; on every count? If yes, the reaction of the market in the past few weeks must have been baffling. Banking stocks have been rising for over a month now, encouraged by improving liquidity conditions and the introduction of the Banking Amendment Bill in Parliament. Since November 20, 2012, the Bank Nifty has moved up 9.7%. But here&rsquo;s the shocker: against the Bank Nifty in which public sector banks (PSU) comprise only 24.1% of the index, the CNX PSU Bank index has gained 15.51%. For once, it seems as if public sector banks are outperforming their private sector counterparts.</p>\n<p class="p3">But is this optimism for real? &ldquo;The market had been rallying on expectations of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India and the Banking Bill,&rdquo; says Nitin Kumar, an analyst with Quant. Perhaps the good news ends here. Now that the central bank has refrained from cutting rates, analysts believe it is premature to get excited about the sector, particularly because the non-performing assets pain is still lingering over PSU banks. &ldquo;The current non-performing loan cycle is different from earlier cycles in terms of the extent of asset quality destruction that has already taken place,&rdquo; points out Krishnan ASV, research analyst, Ambit Capital. The proportion of impaired loans, including restructured advances, is in excess of 7% of the total advances for the banking sector in June this year, the highest since the Lehman crisis of 2008. &ldquo;Three-fourths of these impaired loans belong to PSU banks and it is not showing any scenes of abating,&rdquo; says Krishnan. &ldquo;Such asset quality destruction entails a significantly higher loss, given default, especially in mid-sized corporate entities,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Despite the rally in PSU stocks, currently, several leading public sector banks such as SBI (1.6x), BOI (1.1x) and PNB (1.3x) are trading cheaper than HDFC (4.7x), ICICI (2.1x), Axis Bank (2.2x) and Yes Bank (2.9x), raising hopes that prices could rise further. But that may not be the case. &ldquo;In spite of potentially stronger balance sheets from migration towards Basel 3 [the latest global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy ratio], PSU banks&rsquo; lower return on equity implies a ceiling on the valuation multiples that investors should be willing to pay for these stocks,&rdquo; explains Krishnan.</p>\n<p class="p3">Indeed, this uptick may not be the real thing, warns Kumar. &ldquo;The clear picture will come out only after the third quarter of this fiscal year.&rdquo; Therefore, even if current price trends point to positives for PSU banks, it may be premature to switch loyalties.&nbsp;</p>', 'Public sector banks have rallied significantly in the past one month.

Even if the market was overreacting, considering that the 16% number was the management target not revenue guidance, the nervousness is not completely unfounded. Investors&rsquo; worry seems reasonable as, historically, Indian IT companies&rsquo; growth rates have been about 10-12 percentage points lower than that of Cognizant. The fear is that if Cognizant is targeting about 16% growth, then Indian IT firms will probably be in the mid-single digits.</p>\n<p class="p3">Certainly, the year ahead doesn&rsquo;t look too promising.

He has downgraded the estimated FY14 revenue growth for larger Indian IT vendors from 11% to 8%. This is largely due to poor growth prospects in BFSI (less than 5%) and lacklustre demand environment in other key verticals (telecom and manufacturing).</p>\n<p class="p3">The hit to the topline will, of course, get reflected in the net margin as well. Muthangi states that Infosys&rsquo; higher realisations may come under attack as traditional application development and management (ADM) services are under risk of commoditisation, especially in a low-growth environment. However, the outlook for TCS is not so dire if one goes by what Priya Sunder, analyst at Avendus Securities, writes in her report. &ldquo;Lower exposure to discretionary spending of clients makes TCS the most resilient to volatility in demand.&rdquo; Her target price of Rs 1,463 implies a 16% upside from the current price of #1,258.</p>\n<p class="p3">The only source of solace for Indian IT companies is the depreciating rupee. In spite of strong capital market flows, the rupee has remained weak against the dollar. Analysts, though, are worried that Indian IT companies could miss their guidance for FY13.

That growth is not just a possibility, but almost an inevitability?</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s the art of the IPO and that&rsquo;s when designers are usually called upon to switch on the charm, to ultimately convert investors into believers.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>The big guns</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Kors &mdash; with nine years as a judge on <em>Project Runway</em> and 71% brand recognition in the US &mdash; needed to do very little to get onto Wall Street&rsquo;s radar. The roadshow was left to chief executive officer John Idol. Behind the scenes were Lawrence Stroll and Silas Chou, who, along with Horowitz, engineered the enormous wealth creation at Hilfiger in the 1990s.</p>\n<p class="p3">On one Kors roadshow stop last year, Idol wooed 200 investors in The Pierre hotel&rsquo;s Cotillion Room, and repeated the designer&rsquo;s joke that &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the Hermes of Staten Island,&rdquo; while laying out the growth plan.</p>\n<p class="p3">The visible portion of the Kors IPO process was a lightning-fast two weeks in December 2011. Others carefully court investors over much longer time spans.</p>\n<p class="p3">Entrepreneur Brunello Cucinelli triggered a small revolution by demanding that the roadshow process begin a year before his IPO. Instead of going to market, Cucinelli brought the market to him. Analysts and investors from China, India and South America travelled to the company&rsquo;s headquarters in Solomeo &mdash; the Italian village the designer bought and restored. Investors participated in town celebrations, ate grilled meat and drank local wines at the main <em>osteria</em>, an informal restaurant. They also visited Cucinelli&rsquo;s house with its neo-classical statues, busts of philosophers and a library with books in Mongolian, Chinese, Japanese and other languages.</p>\n<p class="p3">One Chinese investor wanted 200 bottles of the olive oil Cucinelli produces in small quantities, while another group from China wanted to buy the village. Neither request could be accommodated, but Cucinelli made his point. The April IPO was 17 times oversubscribed.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Investors appreciated the time they had (with Cucinelli),&rdquo; said Federico Steiner, partner and general manager at Barabino &amp; Partners, which advised the designer during the IPO and still consults for the firm. &ldquo;This can be a key to success rather than the ordinary 30 minutes during the roadshow. It&rsquo;s important to get to know an entrepreneur and his actions.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Andrea Morante, CEO of Pomellato, recently said he was evaluating an IPO and was planning to speak with Cucinelli.</p>\n<p class="p3">Morante&rsquo;s own pitch is different from Cucinelli&rsquo;s, but he sees similarities between the two businesses &mdash; both play in the niche luxury space, are expanding globally and don&rsquo;t have many brand extensions. The CEO said Pomellato was among the first to offer &ldquo;ready-to-wear jewellery&rdquo; and the brand is seen as &ldquo;unconventional and on the side of women,&rdquo; with advertising that treats &ldquo;women as subjects and not as objects.&rdquo; Hollywood actress Tilda Swinton has fronted the brand for several campaigns.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;A brand must tell a coherent story so investors will know that it has a unique positioning, a point of view, a solid track record and an interesting future,&rdquo; said Tomaso Galli, luxury goods consultant and founder of JTG Consulting. &ldquo;During a roadshow, it&rsquo;s more difficult to tell a complex story.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">The designer companies pitching investors now are relying on the clarity of a single powerhouse brand instead of the safety of a portfolio, <em>&agrave; la</em> LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton or PPR.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;People and investors need to be excited by both the story and the individuals behind the story,&rdquo; says Laurent Feniou, managing director, Rothschild, London. &ldquo;Investors will want to meet and to have a one-on-one relationship with the founder and the CEO. The person behind the brand is critical for the success of the IPO. The passion that is behind the brand&rsquo;s past success and (that will be behind its performance in the) future has to be communicated.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Investors want to know that the driving force behind a label isn&rsquo;t going to take the money raised in the IPO and fade away.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to get a sense &mdash; nearly a physical sense &mdash; of the passion behind the founder and the CEO,&rdquo; Feniou says. &ldquo;One consequence of that is that the CEO, the person behind the brand, needs to demonstrate that he or she is interested in institutional investors.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">With a little bit of TLC for Wall Street &mdash; and the right numbers &mdash; it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard for a designer business to attract the attention of investors.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Retailers and brands are sexy. People can identify with them,&rdquo; says David Shiffman, who is the MD at Peter J Solomon &ldquo;When these big designers go to take their business public, the marquee name of the designer creates incredible buzz. You try to marry up the market cap expectations with the mind share recognition.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">When everything comes together right, there&rsquo;s big money to be made. Just ask Kors, whose personal fortune has ballooned to over the magical $1 billion mark since the IPO in December 2011. Now that Wall Street&rsquo;s reawoken to that fact, it&rsquo;s clear that the IPO is back in fashion.</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>&mdash;New York Times News Service</strong></p>', 'The market is becoming a go-to place for brands when they need to scale up', '31,32', '', 0, '', 'fashion-and-the-art-of-the-ipo-237', 232, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Fashion and the art of the IPO', 'The market is becoming a go-to place for brands when they need to scale up', '', '', '', 'Fashion,IPO', 0, NULL, '2015-01-23 18:10:15', '2015-01-23 18:17:58', '2013-01-19', 0),

The managing partner of ASK Pravi Capital, the Mumbai-based private equity firm, was a student of Class 10 at the time. He forgot all about it till, many years later, he started buying tickets to the annual benefit for cancer patients at St Andrews, Bandra, presented by Anandam, Mumbai&rsquo;s oldest Bengali theatre group. It was a good cause. Pritha, wife of Banerjee&rsquo;s old engineering college batchmate and currently MD of BNP Paribas, Manishi Raychaudhari, was part of the eclectic group of doctors, ex-pilots, businessmen and homemakers that made up Anandam&rsquo;s cast and crew. Banerjee casually wrote to her once, &ldquo;I would love to be a part of the group.&rdquo; She introduced him to Lucky Mukherjee, Anandam&rsquo;s businessman-director, who welcomed him warmly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Rehearsals and a hectic work schedule weren&rsquo;t the best of combinations but the post-2008 Lehman crisis forced business to go slow and Banerjee committed his weekends to Anandam&rsquo;s production. <em>Thakurer Aloey Noti Binodini</em> (&lsquo;Noti Binodini through Tagore&rsquo;s eyes&rsquo;), based on Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&rsquo;s teachings on the life of the actress Binodini, in which Banerjee played Ranga Babu, a <em>zamindar</em> who had a platonic relationship with the actress Binodini. The play debuted to packed houses in 2009. Originally conceived as a one-show one-city event, <em>Thakurer Aloey&hellip;</em> grew and travelled to Delhi, Pune and Kolkata, besides running to repeat shows in Bandra. It was an exhilarating experience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Anandam is amateur but serious. &ldquo;People were paying money to see us so we had to do a good job,&rdquo; laughs Banerjee. The life lessons came for free. &ldquo;I enjoyed the rehearsals,&rdquo; Banerjee recalls with affection. &ldquo;The build-up to the play was unbelievable. There is no competition and no one tries to outdo the other, quite unlike our work life.&rdquo; The stage and the limelight had quite another effect. &ldquo;No matter how well you have rehearsed, there are always some butterflies in your stomach,&rdquo; he admits ruefully, adding that adrenaline takes over on stage, &ldquo;So, not only are you very confident, you tend to remember all your lines and the moment of delivery is actually very exciting.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Banerjee has been a regular at all Anandam shows since then and his 2011 appearance as Rabindranath Tagore is the closest to his heart. This play, called <em>Thakur Barir Alo Andhare </em>(&lsquo;Light and shade of Tagore&rsquo;s mansion&rsquo;), saw him essaying the role of Tagore&rsquo;s brother till the finale, where he switched to play an older version of the great poet himself, fading into the twilight as the curtain dropped. Short and poignant, it never failed to move the crowd and that&rsquo;s why, Banerjee says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my favourite role so far.&rdquo; Acting is so interesting. &ldquo;Everybody is a winner.

(240, 24, '', 'Whisky class', '<p class="p1">What better way could there have been to bid 2012 goodbye than to toast it with India&rsquo;s favourite sundowner &mdash; a glass of scotch or malt &mdash; drowned not in soda but served to open up the whisky? At some point in our history, scotch-and-soda became <em>de rigueur</em> in a false nod to sophistication. While we snigger at the way the Chinese, the Koreans and the Taiwanese &ldquo;kill&rdquo; their whisky with anything from Sprite to fruit juice, have we considered what the Europeans think of our peculiar habit of similarly drowning out the taste of a good whisky in not just soda but too much soda?</p>\n<p class="p3">The recent years have seen us sip, gargle and swallow our wines, there have been appreciation sessions on food pairings, on vodka tastings &mdash; hell, we&rsquo;ve even done water tastings. But whisky? To be fair, we&rsquo;ve gone through our samples of everything from Jura to Balvenie to even Johnnie W, but with the recent trend that we&rsquo;re free to enjoy our whisky, vodka or cognac any which way we prefer it &mdash; and convention be dammed &mdash; no one bothers any more to advise on how whisky is best savoured.</p>\n<p class="p3">Look around you and chances are you&rsquo;ll find everyone opting for a tall glass for whisky. To begin with a whisky tumbler should be short and heavy. The heaviness or thickness of the glass is useful for maintaining temperature, but experts recommend clear glass over cut-crystal for you to enjoy your whisky better. The short tumbler comes in three variants &mdash; straight, narrow at the rim, or wide at the rim. The first is simply boring; my own preference is for the latter two and not just because they have more personality &mdash; drinking whisky is, after all, a macho thing, even for women who enjoy their single malts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">So, how do the glasses work? If the tumbler narrows at the top, it helps to trap the fumes, which is great for when it&rsquo;s cold, such as now. In the summers, when ice with your whisky is an imperative, the glass with the wider mouth is preferable. My rule of thumb: use the tumbler that narrows at the mouth if you like your whisky with a wee dram of water; the wider mouth is better if you&rsquo;re inclined to use ice. Soda? Philistines shouldn&rsquo;t be reading this &mdash; really.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There&rsquo;s no better way to drink your whisky but neat. But that view is contestable by most aficionados, most of them master blenders in the breweries of Scotland. Their suggested &mdash; though they won&rsquo;t say it out loud &mdash; way of having whisky is either with literally a thimbleful of water or with one cube of ice. The dribble of water in either choice quite literally opens up the whisky, so that all its flavours come tantalisingly alive to explode in the mouth. Given India&rsquo;s mostly warm weather, ice might be a better choice to water, but hey, develop your own taste-buds, especially since a whisky is best quaffed, not sipped (hah! all you namby-pamby <em>sodawallahs</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The only time it&rsquo;s okay to adulterate a whisky (bourbon, actually) is when it&rsquo;s a JD (Jack Daniels), which truly is best had with Coke, partly because it&rsquo;s convention, partly because a bourbon is horrible with soda, though I&rsquo;ve personally never minded it with just ice &mdash; lots of ice, actually, which is how I prefer most whiskies (the one-cube rule doesn&rsquo;t work for me).</p>\n<p class="p3">Plus, most of us &mdash; at parties, in any case &mdash; wind up having our drinks standing up, when knocking back a couple of unadulterated whiskies can knock you off your feet. Instead, ask the bartender for a whisky on the rocks and while you may get industrial strength ice in your glass, the bartender will also be more than generous with his measure &mdash; meaning you get more whisky for the asking. And as the ice melts and slowly teases the whisky, you&rsquo;ll end up enjoying the flavours far more, far longer. <span class="s2">&beta;</span></p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>&mdash;The author is a Delhi-based writer and curator&nbsp;</strong></p>', 'It''s not the whisky you drink as much as how you drink it that counts', '17', '', 0, '', 'whisky-class-240', 235, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Whisky class', 'It''s not the whisky you drink as much as how you drink it that counts', '', '', '', 'Jura,Balvenie,Johnnie Walker,Jack Daniels', 0, NULL, '2015-01-23 18:33:23', '2015-01-23 18:37:13', '2013-01-19', 0),

(243, 12, '', 'Vas-tly different', '<p class="p1">Rewind a bit to <em>Kaun Banega Crorepati</em>&rsquo;s second season, aired from mid-2005 to early-2006. It was Comviva&rsquo;s (formerly Bharti Telesoft) tele-voting app for Airtel subscribers that had millions of viewers flooding the show with SMSes for a chance to win a place on it. Airtel&rsquo;s peak load capacity was utilised only for 15 minutes after each episode but costly resources got blocked over the rest of the day when only 4-5% of the network was put to use. Not only that, critical user profile data was generated but not used. Brij Mohan Mahendru, 37 years old at the time, was watching the show keenly for reasons entirely other than the Big B&rsquo;s charms. <em>KBC2</em>&rsquo;s primitive data handling confirmed to Mahendru, then a VP at Bharti Telesoft, that a single platform was needed that would roll out multiple services (call manager, call/SMS filter) and cross-link user profiles for marketers. &ldquo;I began discussing it with friends,&rdquo; recalls Mahendru, co-founder and director, mCarbon, who also sounded his bosses at Comviva out on the idea. They loved it but it wasn&rsquo;t Telesoft&rsquo;s thing so Mahendru set out with Rajesh Razdan, a friend and erstwhile colleague heading Telesoft&rsquo;s biz development in the Saarc to start mCarbon. The mobile value-added service (VAS) company with a difference was born in March 2008, after some serious preparatory legwork.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;He was a techie and I was into sales,&rdquo; says Razdan, founder-director, mCarbon. Their idea was persuasive. Other erstwhile colleagues joined them. Funding was more finicky &mdash; VCs were too busy drooling over low hanging fruit like simple VAS such as hello tunes and wallpapers. But a friend pitched in with seed money and Mahendru and Razdan pooled in their savings. Then, &ldquo;We presented our plan to Canaan Partners in early 2008 and they confirmed their funding by July of that year,&rdquo; remembers Mahendru. Two things about mCarbon stood out for Alok Mittal, managing director of Canaan Partners&rsquo; India operations, &ldquo;One was the team: both Rajesh and Brij have been in the [telecom] sector for a long time. Two, their products were solving real problems for operators.&rdquo; Canaan, which was also convinced of the model&rsquo;s scalability, pitched in with $5 million. Four years later, mCarbon has also deployed call-me-backs, DNDs (do-not-disturb) and missed call alerts for a client list that includes Vodafone, Idea, MTNL, MTS, Uninor and Tata DoCoMo.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">mCarbon operates on an almost too-simple idea. Generally, VAS providers offer a point solutions approach, installing independent hardware and software systems for each service like caller ring back tone (CRBT) or voice messenger, and then integrating them with an operator&rsquo;s network via dedicated links. &ldquo;More resources are used so this increases the load on networks, consuming more space and power, and running up higher maintenance costs,&rdquo; Mahendru explains. Instead, mCarbon&rsquo;s Greenroom, its flagship product, sits on the operators&rsquo; networks (independent hosting is possible, if that&rsquo;s what you want), delivering multiple services (call manager, SMS analyser and Channel 99, a WAP magazine) for a fraction of the resources, interpreting client profiles along the way. Mahendru is convincing: &ldquo;The cost reduces to one-fourth when we do this. We have provided seven critical services to Airtel on this single platform, including Airtel&rsquo;s gifting services.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Greenroom&rsquo;s other attraction is its strong analytics base: telecom operators can know not only the location and demographics of their customers but also their usage patterns, most-dialled numbers, recharge duration and bill payment cycles. Operators can offer discounts, incentives and customised plans based on this data, improving retention of their subscriber base. &ldquo;We started with the call manager service for Airtel in July 2008 and by October, Idea had also become our client,&rdquo; says Razdan. mCarbon closed the first fiscal of its operations, FY09, with a revenue of #4.5 crore. &ldquo;We had revenues of Rs 20 crore in FY12 and the target is to scale up to Rs 60 crore by FY14. We will be making profits this fiscal.&rdquo; Mahendru hopes mCarbon&rsquo;s phase 2 will make it a Rs 100-crore company by 2017.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Good going, slow revenues&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">&ldquo;Their model is scalable,&rdquo; Canaan&rsquo;s Mittal observes. &ldquo;The first step in the business was to get access to operators, which they have done well.&rdquo; But it wasn&rsquo;t easy. By 2007-08, the networks of some operators had grown to over 100 million subscribers and the behemoths weren&rsquo;t interested in talking to a start-up that would &lsquo;sit on&rsquo; them. &ldquo;Convincing Airtel about Call Manager was the biggest challenge,&rdquo; recalls Mahendru. Now, operators outside India are also signing up. Sri Lanka&rsquo;s Dialog, part of Malaysia&rsquo;s Axiata Group, is already a client; mCarbon&rsquo;s 120-member team is serving Airtel in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Kenya; and Razdan adds that the company is in discussion with some operators in West Asia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Caution appears to drive mCarbon. &ldquo;We could have expanded much faster,&rdquo; Razdan admits. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t expose ourselves to mobile marketing services, which could bring quick money but could also be commoditised. Ours is a is long-term and networks driven model.&rdquo; Competitors are equally chary, but for different reasons. The only way a network can do away with mCarbon is to replace Greenroom and the services offered through it, which won&rsquo;t be easy. Mahendru explains, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a room with only one chair. Greenroom sits in the critical path of call and data and there is no scope for anyone else.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It was Trai&rsquo;s DND registry, launched in September 2011 to save telecom subscribers from pesky calls and SMS adverts, which came as a shot in the arm for mCarbon. &ldquo;Suddenly, all the calls and SMSes had to be filtered,&rdquo; says a smiling Mahendru. &ldquo;We got significant orders from telcos like Uninor and Airtel and we leapfrogged into the deployment of large systems in just six to seven weeks.&rdquo; In fact, mCarbon&rsquo;s Call Manager had been designed and adopted by Airtel and Idea almost two years before DND was announced. &ldquo;We were ready with it and so we got 60-70% of the market,&rdquo; notes Mahendru. Since DND was mandated, it was a network load operators had to bear, which they did by buying a licence and paying mCarbon a lump sum with a capacity cap. As the number of subscribers and the telemarketing efforts increase, the peak load will go up. The company also rolled out gifting services for Airtel in March 2012, so users could gift talk time or SMS packs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">mCarbon&rsquo;s revenue, like that of other VAS players, looks less laudable. Currently, telcos share upto only 20% of the monthly or per transaction subscription revenues with VAS firms. &ldquo;Operators need to understand that VAS players are partners and vendors providing innovation,&rdquo; wishes Mahendru, without going into the exact percentage mCarbon gets to keep. &ldquo;The industry needs to re-look the revenue share model as it stands today,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">The founders believe there&rsquo;s no end to the services that can be offered on Greenroom; they are currently working on adding personalised messages to the call manager. Mittal agrees: &ldquo;Now, they have to drive revenues.&rdquo; His optimism should make the next round of funding easier for mCarbon. <span class="s1"><br /></span></p>', 'mCarbon has changed the way telecom networks use their resources, offering a platform that can run multiple services', '33', '', 0, '', 'vas-tly-different-243', 238, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Vas-tly different', 'mCarbon has changed the way telecom networks use their resources, offering a platform that can run multiple services', '', '', '', 'mCarbon,Mobile value-added service,Canaan Partners'' India,Airtel,Idea Cellular,Uninor', 0, NULL, '2015-01-27 11:43:24', '2015-01-27 11:52:01', '2013-02-16', 0),

At the same time, corporates, which account for over 65% of the luxury hotels business, have cut back on their spending. &ldquo;The increase in demand has insulated the mid-market segment from severe price erosion,&rdquo; says Sanjay Sethi, MD, Berggruen Hotels, which runs the Keys brand. Average room realisations (ARR) of mid-market hotels have dropped by 25% compared with luxury hotels, which saw an erosion of about 40-50% from 2008 to 2011, claim industry experts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The increase in demand for mid-market rooms has insulated the segment from price erosion" - Sanjay Sethi, MD, Bergrruen Hotels</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">No wonder it&rsquo;s this segment of the hotel industry that&rsquo;s seeing maximum action (<em>See: More to come</em>). The line-up would tempt even armchair travellers, with both domestic and international companies laying out the red carpet to their mid-market properties, among them Indian Hotels&rsquo; Ginger and Gateway brands, Berggruen&rsquo;s Keys and Fleur Hotels&rsquo; Lemon Tree and Lemon Tree Premier. Hilton, Accor, Carlson Hyatt, Marriott and Starwood have also announced plans of expanding their mid-market portfolio. Hospitality industry consultancy HVS India says that 93,355 rooms will get added to the existing 84,000 by March 2017 across major cities, of which over 50% will be in the mid-market and budget segments.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>More to come- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Currently, only about 20% of the hotel rooms in India are in the mid-market space compared with about 65% globally,&rdquo; says Rahul Pandit, president, Lemon Tree and Red Fox Hotels. Others like Suresh Kumar, CEO of ITC Fortune Park, too, are gung-ho on the space, &ldquo;This segment of hotels has become popular as it appeals to both &mdash; the investors as well as the guests. While an investor gets a model suited to his capital deployment capability, the domestic traveller gets convenience and comfort at an affordable price,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Cheap and best</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">There are a few other big reasons why mid-market hotels have become hot properties. Building and running a mid-market hotel is much cheaper than a luxury hotel. This means that breakeven and profits come faster. It is not surprising when hoteliers such as Jean-Michel Cass&eacute;, senior VP, Accor India, say, &ldquo;Even as the company is planning to develop hotels under the luxury brands, our main focus will be the economy and middle scale segment.&rdquo; First off, the cost of running a mid-market hotel, which needs about 60 staffers per 100 rooms, is considerably lower than the 200-250 required for a 5-star hotel of a similar size. The development cost is also much less. HVS India says it takes between Rs 1 crore and Rs 2.75 crore to develop one room in a luxury property while the cost incurred for the same is between Rs 35 lakh and Rs 85 lakh for a mid-market hotel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"This segment of hotels has become popular as it appelas to both &mdash; the investors as well as the guests" - Suresh Kumar, CEO, Fortune Park Hotels</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">That said, hotel developers have to factor in the cost of land that is, on average, 20% of the final cost of the property in the US and 10% in China but 50% in India. Moreover, luxury hotel rooms are bigger (375-400 sq ft) compared with mid-market rooms (about 300 sq ft). &ldquo;Assuming the same plot area, you get more rooms and hence, higher revenue,&rdquo; says Om Goenka, owner, Citrus Hotels, which has eight properties in cities such as Goa, Pune, Bengaluru and Alleppey. On average a mid-market hotel breaks even in about four years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Our aim is to have an 18% return on capital across properties and that is why we go the extra mile at the construction stage,&rdquo; says Pandit. Citing the example of a basic 300 sq ft room, he explains, &ldquo;If market research shows that a third of the probable customers will be couples, a third singles, and the rest two-bed singles, then, a third of the hotel will have 285 sq ft rooms that can accommodate a single queen-sized bed. This 15 sq ft saved translates into an additional two rooms in a 100-room hotel.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Our aim at Lemon Tree and Red Fox is to have atleast an 18% return on capital across properties" - Rahul Pandit, president, Lemon Tree Hotels</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">With the lower cost model, the hotels are also able to tap the latent demand in non-metros. For instance, in the pilgrim town of Rameswaram, a one-night stay at Daiwik will set you back by Rs 2,800. &ldquo;Travelling for religious purposes does not mean you have to stay in a <em>dharamshala</em>,&rdquo; points out Debashish Ghoshal, managing director and CEO of Daiwik Hotels. &ldquo;I do not think we are ready for 5-star hotels at these locations yet but it made sense to open a mid-market hotel,&rdquo; he adds. Over a two-year period, the company plans to have 2,000 hotel rooms in 15 pilgrimage centres, including Madurai, Varanasi and Srisailam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Confused middle&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Despite this demand demarcation, segmentation is hazy. Internationally, the market is neatly segmented into budget ($50 to $75), mid-market ($75 to $150), upscale ($150 to $300) and luxury (upwards of $300), but in India it is not that clearly defined. This means that hotel brands can easily get their price-product proposition wrong and err on the side of too little or plenty. Service expectations, a key differentiator in the hospitality industry, differ as well. &ldquo;Foreign brands are accustomed to differentiating themselves on the basis of service though the product remains more or less the same,&rdquo; says Lemon Tree&rsquo;s Pandit. Premier Inn, for example, is positioned as a budget brand globally and does not offer services like in-room dining and service internationally. But, in India, it has positioned itself as a mid-market chain with an expanded in-room menu and service. Another example, a room at a five-star Ista sells for about Rs 6,500 in Bengaluru&rsquo;s MG road while a Lemon Tree Premier also commands the same tariff. Premier Inn India&rsquo;s country head Shwetank Singh says these fuzzy boundaries arise as the Indian market has had only luxury properties or poorly-run hotels in the past. &ldquo;Quality consciousness is just setting in and most notions of hospitality in India come from five-star or four-star properties. The consumer, hence, is not very clear what mid-market or budget stands for,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>The masterplan- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In any case, the concept of a &ldquo;budget hotel&rdquo; comprising a clean basic stay and minimum service does not seem to be taking off in India. Goenka narrates the example of his property at Pimpri, an industrial hub in Maharashtra where his hotel is next to a Ginger that charges about Rs 2,000 compared with a Citrus rate of around Rs 4,500. &ldquo;Almost everyday, you have guests switching over to us. Concepts like Ginger work if you have to stay for a night or two and just need a bed to crash, but anything more than that, you need basic services,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Others, too, are experimenting and learning. &ldquo;We had a lot of discussion around whether we should have room service in Red Fox or not,&rdquo; Pandit recalls. &ldquo;We tried to do without but there were sharp reactions.&rdquo; Lemon Tree, in fact, first decided not to provide newspapers but had to introduce them after adverse feedback. Consulting firms like HVS India expect the &ldquo;price-value&rdquo; expectation to get better defined as international brands arrive and the market matures.</p>\n<p class="p3">The mid-market proposition only gets more complex when it comes to the line dividing business and leisure tourism. Contrary to expectations, it is not just business travellers that are driving the mid-market segment. &ldquo;For us, it is a 60:40 mix,&rdquo; says Citrus Hotel&rsquo;s Goenka. Even for Keys Hotels, the focus is equally on the tourist as well as the business travellers. &ldquo;For a property like Lonavla, which is close to Mumbai, we see that for four days it is business meetings, conventions and seminars that drive traffic. But for the remaining three, we get the leisure traveller,&rdquo; says Sethi, adding that he expects domestic tourists and not business travellers to drive future growth. &ldquo;But then, if a person is spending money from his own pocket, his expectations do go up. So you will eventually end up adding a pool or a spa. This is not something that you will find in most mid-market hotels abroad,&rdquo; adds Goenka.</p>\n<p class="p3">Most hotels are beginning to balance customer expectations and their product to ensure that they earn their monies. Keys, for instance, creates a well-lit friendly common area that has pool tables and Xbox games, not to mention well-trained bartenders and staff. &ldquo;We found that our billings from the bar and F&amp;B have gone up,&rdquo; exults Sethi. &ldquo;Guests also invite friends over to catch up with them.&rdquo; Similarly, Lemon Tree is paying extra attention to women travellers, who make up 15% of its clientele. It tries to ensure that female guests feel safe and are given extra care and attention when visiting its properties.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Trouble in paradise</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">All that calculated optimism does not eliminate ground realities. Already, some hotel groups are struggling under high debt because of heavy expenditure incurred on acquiring land. Kamat Hotels, which owns the Orchid brand, is now trying to sell three land parcels in Coimbatore, Nagpur and Raipur to pay off debts of Rs 435 crore. It is also revamping its operations to focus on franchisees. The rest of the players, too, are proceeding with caution and an asset-light model where existing operators teaming up with landowners is in vogue. Sethi says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s prohibitive to buy land in places like Gurgaon. Initially, we followed an asset-heavy policy for Keys. But now, we intend to make selective acquisitions.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Declining ARRs, at least in the short term, will be another factor affecting profitability. There is no denying that mid-market hotels are coming up at a time when supply of rooms is already high, and occupancy rates and ARRs are falling. HVS India notes that while the supply of rooms was up by 18% over last fiscal, the average occupancy rate was down to 59.1% in FY12 as compared to 60.6% in FY11 and 68.8% in FY08. ARRs, too, declined from #7,989 in FY08 and Rs 6,513 in FY11 to Rs 6,257 in FY12. Rating agency Icra expects hotel industry demand to shrink by 5-6% in FY13 even as room supply is expected to increase about 13-15% across key markets. The end result could be a further erosion of 5% in ARRs.</p>\n<p class="p3">But HVS India counters that, saying recent reports are overplaying a doomsday scenario. It says that while the major cities witnessed a 15% increase in supply in FY12, demand too increased by 12%. &ldquo;Even when average occupancy declined in FY12, it is important to note that it was owing to supply increasing faster than demand, and not due to an absolute decline in demand,&rdquo; says Kaushik Vardharajan, MD, consulting and valuation practice, HVS India.</p>\n<p class="p3">Moreover, hotel developers are quite accustomed to the long gestation of the sector and are not worrying about over-supply. Patu Keswani, founder of Lemon Tree, is planning 35 more hotels in a partnership with Dutch group APG over the next five years. Others like Uttam Dave, president and CEO, InterGlobe Hotels, is currently developing 19 Ibis hotels with 3,600 rooms to be opened across India by 2015. He says, &ldquo;Our decision to ramp up development is based on the rapid economic growth that we are seeing across the country, combined with the acute shortage of quality hotel accommodation at value-for-money prices.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Much of the hotel industry&rsquo;s optimism is also based on the reversal of the hotel industry cycle, typically a seven-year one. &ldquo;I think 2013 will not be very good, but post 2014, I expect good years,&rdquo; says Citrus&rsquo; Goenka. His optimism is also based on markets like Whitefield outside Bengaluru, where demand is growing minus fresh supply. A market like Pune, on the other hand, will worsen before it improves, he adds. Compared with other major cities around the world, metros and mini-metro cities in India have a far lower supply of affordable quality rooms. &ldquo;Even with the estimated addition of around 60,000 rooms across India in the next five years, there will still be a shortfall, providing a huge opportunity to investors and operators across all segments,&rdquo; says ITC&rsquo;s Kumar. Like all things Indian, the potential might be immense, but only those operators with the right business model, a keen eye on costs and customer expectations will survive to reap <br /> the benefits. &nbsp;</p>', 'Mid-market hotels are finally offering guests better-than-budget properties for cheaper-than-luxury prices ', '29', '', 0, '', 'the-middle-ground-is-looking-up-244', 239, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'The middle ground is looking up', 'Mid-market hotels are finally offering guests better-than-budget properties for cheaper-than-luxury prices ', '', '', '', 'Mid-market hotels,Bergrruen Hotels,Fleur Hotels,ITC Fortune Park,Citrus Hotels,Daiwik Hotels', 0, NULL, '2015-01-27 11:53:46', '2015-01-27 12:15:08', '2013-02-16', 0),
(245, 12, '', 'Coming full circle', '<p class="p1">Are the testing times for microfinance institutions (MFIs) really over? This quarter, the posterboy-turned-villain of MFIs in India is back in the spotlight after a turnaround. SKS Microfinance recorded a net profit of Rs 1.2 crore in the December quarter compared with whopping losses of Rs 262 crore in the September 2012 quarter and Rs 428 crore in the year-ago quarter. Interestingly, its growth has been driven by states other than Andhra Pradesh, which was the most lucrative catchment area for MFIs before political conspiracy killed it. SKS&rsquo;s Andhra Pradesh portfolio has been reduced to zero from a high of Rs 1,491 crore in October 2010 when the microfinance crisis really hit the state. But loans disbursements rose by 14% to Rs 784 crore during the quarter while interest income in those states, too, grew by 16% to Rs 79 crore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Diminishing returns- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">This turnaround in SKS&rsquo;s fortune after its spectacular fall from grace, followed by seven consecutive quarters of losses, is bound to trigger hopes of several MFIs that were planning to tap the public markets in their bid for greater visibility as well as valuations.&nbsp;But it may be a while before that happens. According to a recent report on the state of the microfinance sector, most MFIs surveyed had return on assets (RoA) in the range of 0-1%, while in terms of return on equity (RoE), most were in the 0-10% range <em>(see: Diminishing returns)</em>. The yield on portfolio, too, has come down to 23.88% from 26.63% the previous year, even as operating cost has increased as a proportion of loan portfolio.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Down, but not out</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Clearly, profitability of MFIs in FY12 has come down, thanks to the aftermath of the AP crisis, the liquidity crunch that followed and reduced client outreach. The growth in client outreach dropped 15.7% in 2011-12, compared with an increase of 19.1% the previous year <em>(see: Down, but not out)</em>. Meanwhile, the gross loan portfolio remained almost stagnant, falling 3%, suggesting that MFIs are &ldquo;unable to service existing customers and perhaps not acquiring new customers&rdquo;, the report says. If MFIs are to return to their earlier prime position, they will have to bring in more efficiency in their operations so that their profitability is at a level the stock markets will get excited about.

(246, 16, '', 'Flying high on low fares', '<p class="p1">Sushil Kumar is triumphant. On January 11, the Delhi-based optician successfully booked seven tickets to Goa for just Rs 2,013 each under a promotional scheme by SpiceJet. He was one of 700,000 people who were able to buy tickets during the 72-hour offer that saw the airline&rsquo;s site as well as online travel websites repeatedly hang, unable to handle the traffic. &ldquo;Airfares were prohibitively expensive earlier and travelling by train would have meant shutting my store for three more days,&rdquo; says Kumar. &ldquo;This was a very welcome surprise.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Not for other players in the airlines business. Since the grounding of Kingfisher Airlines and the resultant shortage of airline seats, airfares have been going in only one direction, up. So, SpiceJet&rsquo;s decision to offer 1 million tickets at this low, all-inclusive price for travel in the lean season (between February and April) caught the industry unaware. Reportedly, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) stepped in to prevent a fare war by asking other airlines to avoid similar price cuts. They agreed at the time &mdash; terming SpiceJet&rsquo;s move &ldquo;suicidal&rdquo; and &ldquo;absurd&rdquo; &mdash; but are now in the market with their own versions of cheap tickets. While Jet Airways is offering 30-day advance bookings starting from Rs 2,320 to Rs 3,200 in some sectors under a LoFares scheme, Go Air launched a similar initiative with fares starting at Rs 2,320. Meanwhile, Indigo has low introductory fares to Dubai from Mumbai. Naturally, no airline accepts that its offers are a reaction to the SpiceJet move. &ldquo;We want to help people enlarge their business, to visit their families more frequently, to provide them opportunities to enjoy holidays,&rdquo; gushes Giorgio De Roni, CEO, Go Air.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But is it really a good idea for airlines to keep fares low? Almost all airlines are bleeding and SpiceJet returned to profitability only in Q3FY13.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will be sustainable only if you do it smartly on a year-round basis for revenue optimisation, not if you create artificial demand once a year for revenue maximisation,&rdquo; says Rajesh Magow, chief operating officer, MakeMyTrip.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Super schemes - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">There is a certain logic in dropping fares &mdash; air traffic has been falling since May 2012, for the first time since 2009, and a short-term offer could encourage new passengers to try out an airline. &ldquo;It helps in ensuring a certain capacity in advance and in winning marketshare,&rdquo; says Dheeraj Mathur, national aerospace and defence leader, PricewaterhouseCoopers. Certainly, offers like these offer some tangible benefits &mdash; rise in traffic, repeat customers, top of mind recall. &ldquo;But these may be shortlived in the case of bumper schemes. Price-offs have to be done route by route and flight by flight,&rdquo; says Magow.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">And not at the cost of the bottomline. &ldquo;If you are paying people to fly, it is unsustainable. It will hurt everyone,&rdquo; warns Mathur. Indeed, even the DGCA&rsquo;s argument against knee-jerk reactions by other airlines to SpiceJet&rsquo;s offer was that new passengers wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily avail of the offer &mdash; the regulator cautioned that it would be regular flyers who would jump at the opportunity and airlines would be depriving themselves of passengers who would otherwise have paid full fare.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">As it is, airlines in India have to deal with a challenging environment with high taxes on fuel, airport charges and so on, as well as the price sensitivity of the Indian traveller. De Roni doesn&rsquo;t believe Go&rsquo;s low fare schemes are unsustainable but agrees that there are issues. &ldquo;The challenge is that any increase in cost due to third parties [such as fuel, taxes, airports, etc.] must be transferred to the final customers who, at the end, suffer due to the inefficiencies of the system. The industry overall needs a revision of the framework within which airlines operate,&rdquo; he says. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">So, when can low-fare offers work? &nbsp;When there is true, real-time pricing. Give tickets cheap when a flight is leaving in four hours and occupancy is low, suggests Mathur. Meanwhile, SpiceJet CEO Neil Mills is unapologetic about setting the market on its ears. Speaking with a business daily recently, he said, &ldquo;We are selling capacity we had not expected to sell.

(247, 16, '', 'Changing partners', '<p class="p1">When the first Debenhams outlet opened in India in October 2007, the British retailer was more than optimistic about the road ahead. Never mind that the store &mdash; opened in partnership with Planet Retail at Gurgaon&rsquo;s Ambience Mall &mdash; was nearly 18 months behind schedule. Debenhams&rsquo; international director, Francis Mcauley, declared that he would be disappointed if the company did not have 30 stores in India over the next 10 years, by when the Indian operations could be the retailer&rsquo;s biggest outside the UK, he predicted. Now, six years later, those forecasts are nowhere close to realisation &mdash; the department store has just three stores across India, two in the national capital region and one in Mumbai. The brand also has a new partner in Arvind Lifestyle Brands, which bought out Planet Retail&rsquo;s interest in November 2012. Expectations are rising again, although they are considerably more muted than the last time. &ldquo;I am confident that within the next five years, we will have around eight Debenhams stores in the five biggest cities,&rdquo; says a company spokesperson.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">At the other end of the spectrum, several high-end brands, too, have switched partners or changed business models. In 2009, the Murjanis parted ways with Jimmy Choo and Bottega Veneta, both of which moved to Genesis Colors. Aigner, meanwhile, dumped Genesis Colors in 2010, while last year, Versace and Corneliani ended their franchise agreements with Delhi&rsquo;s Blues Clothing. Again last year, Giorgio Armani quit its joint venture (JV) with DLF Brands and moved to Genesis Colors. DLF terms the termination a &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; one. &ldquo;The luxury business cannot be scaled up in India as fast as we previously believed. So, for now, we will focus on the premium segment of the fashion and retail business,&rdquo; says DLF Brands CEO Dipak Agarwal, adding that Armani, too, has scaled down its expectations. &ldquo;The move to end a JV and enter a franchisee model shows that the brand has narrowed its business interests in India,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Ending a JV amd entering a franchisee model shows that the brand has narrowed its business interests in India" - Dipak Agarwal, CEO, DLF Brands</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Despite the promise of a big consumer market &mdash; a growing middle class with rising disposable incomes, growing awareness of international brands and trends and an increasing willingness to spend on them &mdash; many international fashion brands have been forced to rethink their India ambitions. Research by Delhi-based retail consultancy Third Eyesight shows that since 2006-07, some 50-odd brands, including Next, Guess, Gas, Etam, Rifle, Morgan, Saville Row, Lerros, Corneliani and S.Olivers, among many others, have either exited India or have restructured their operations in the country. And the trend continued in 2012, despite the government allowing 100% foreign ownership for single-brand retail outfits in January last year. Brands such as Versace and Alfred Dunhill are said to be eyeing the exit sign currently. How did so many brands get their India strategy so wrong?</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Misreading the market</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Since 2005, there has been a four-fold increase in the number of international fashion brands entering the Indian market, triggered by the government decision to allow 51% FDI in single-brand retail in January 2006. It didn&rsquo;t hurt, either, that import duties on apparel came down sharply from about 100% in the 1990s to 35% currently. The result: the organised fashion retail market more than doubled from about Rs 1,000 crore in 2005 to Rs 2,500 crore currently and is expected to touch Rs 6,000 crore by 2015, according to Technopak.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">At the same time, for many brands, finding the right business model and understanding the Indian consumer has been an uphill task. &ldquo;Some find India too complex a market. Besides, partners also tend to have differences when it comes to dealing with the marketplace, the waiting time and investments required to make things work,&rdquo; points out Devangshu Dutta, CEO, Third Eyesight.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Partners tend to have differences when it comes to dealing with marketplace and investments" - Devangshu Datta, CEO, Third Eyesight</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Ankur Bisen, VP, retail and consumer products, Technopak, offers another reason. &ldquo;The mistake many people make is they think of India as one big market, when it is actually many markets in one.&rdquo; For instance, Delhi starts buying winter clothing when it is still hot in Chennai. And people in the north have different colour and style preferences than those in South India. &ldquo;Add to that poor retail infrastructure &mdash; the lack of trained manpower, high rentals etc. &mdash; and you know why brands have been finding it tough.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Consider Marks &amp; Spencer (M&amp;S). The British retailer entered India in 2000 with a franchisee agreement with Planet Retail, positioning itself as a luxury brand although it was just a high-street label back in the UK. All merchandise was imported from the UK and, not surprisingly, was substantially overpriced. In 2009, M&amp;S switched to an equal JV with Reliance Brands and has started sourcing and manufacturing 60% of its merchandise in India and South Asia, which has brought down its prices by almost 20-30%. The store has also repositioned itself as a mid-market retailer and is making clothes more suited to Indian preferences &mdash; longer lengths, higher necklines and more colour options. &ldquo;We have a better understanding of local taste and style now and our range has been tailored to suit these,&rdquo; says Venu Nair, MD, Marks &amp; Spencer India.</p>\n<p class="p3">Similarly, in October 2012, Esprit broke its seven-year licensing and distribution deal with Madura Fashion &amp; Lifestyle after reportedly suffering losses of Rs 20-25 crore every year. German brand Lerros, which had a JV with House of Pearl, too, met a similar fate in 2008 and switched to Numero Uno instead.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Like M&amp;S, these brands also misread the market completely, charging way too much and trying to pass themselves off as premium offerings when their international positioning was more middle market. British brand Next, too, signed up with Arvind Lifestyle recently, breaking a seven-year relationship with Planet Retail.</p>\n<p class="p3">As it is, most exits or change of Indian partner have some common threads &mdash; increasing cost pressures with aggressive expansion of the brands at expensive locations; high pricing due to costly merchandise imports and little or no local sourcing; and the inability to position and price a brand correctly and communicate it to the target customer group.</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s what happened with Benetton. The iconic Italian fashion brand was one of the earliest entrants into India, with a 50:50 JV with the DCM group in 1991. In 2004, it split with DCM and began operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary. But by then, Benetton was already seen as a T-shirt company that was always on sale &mdash; the company advertised heavily during its two annual sales but did virtually nothing the rest of the year; it didn&rsquo;t help that the ads showed products that weren&rsquo;t available in India. The Italian parent brought in a new team, focused on increasing local sourcing and made the product offering more up to date. &ldquo;Earlier, there was a view in the company that the Indian consumer did not have the same sensibilities for fashion as international customers. That was a mistake,&rdquo; concedes Sanjeev Mohanty, Benetton&rsquo;s MD in India. Now, the Indian stores are on par with stores in London, Paris and Milan, with the same clothes and visual merchandise effects, although all manufacturing is done locally. There&rsquo;s also been a change in how Benetton sells in India: the company is now a pure wholesale player in India, catering to over 500 stores across 110 cities, with reported sales upwards of Rs 650 crore. &ldquo;We own no stores and have instead appointed master franchisees that distribute our products,&rdquo; says Mohanty. &ldquo;We do have a complete grip on design, marketing and guidelines for selling our products, though.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>The local edge</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Where Benetton and M&amp;S have realised the need to source locally, many brands falter by insisting on importing merchandise. &ldquo;This alone can push up costs by 30-35%,&rdquo; says Third Eyesight&rsquo;s Dutta. If the retailer can&rsquo;t pass on the increased cost to the customer, margins are immediately hit. Several international brands have faced this problem and are now increasing their local sourcing or giving licences to Indian partners to manufacture on their behalf. At Lacoste, for instance, long-time partner Sports &amp; Leisure Apparel has the licence to manufacture and retail the French company&rsquo;s apparel in India. &ldquo;Manufacturing in India has helped in cutting costs, allowing us to maintain a better bottomline. We are also able to get new designs and clothes to the market faster,&rdquo; says Rajesh Jain, CEO, Lacoste India.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The view was that Indian consumers differ in sensibilities for fashion from international customers" - Sanjeev Mohanty, MD, Benetton India</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>It&rsquo;s not only about cost; importing apparel also means limited scope to adapt sizes and styles. &ldquo;India has very local aesthetics and some brands don&rsquo;t allow for that. They try to plug and play and that&rsquo;s where the trouble starts,&rdquo; says Max India executive director Vasanth Kumar. The Dubai-based Landmark Group&rsquo;s value clothing brand has a design team of 20 people working in India to adapt Max&rsquo;s global lines to local sensibilities. That hasn&rsquo;t saved it from mistakes, though: over the past six years, the chain has grown to over 70 stores but has also closed outlets at places like Jalgaon and Nanded. &ldquo;It takes time to understand the different tastes and needs of consumers across the country,&rdquo; points out Kumar.</p>\n<p><strong>"It takes time to understand the different tastes and needs of consumers across the country" - Vasanth Kumar, ED, Max India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Trouble is, foreign brands can be rather impatient and their haste to expand can backfire. High-cost rentals were part of the reason Gas exited India the first time and it&rsquo;s also a key reason why S.Oliver is yet to make a profit here. The German brand entered India in 2007 through a joint venture with Orient Craft and opened large stores &mdash; 5,500 sq ft on average &mdash; in prime locations; the brand reportedly signed a long lease for a 7,000 sq ft store in Delhi&rsquo;s Select Citywalk mall for Rs 3 crore. In May 2012, Orient Craft sold its 49% holding in the JV to Design Pod India. The new strategy includes halving the size of outlets to 1,200-2,400 sq ft. While clothes will still be imported, they will be procured directly from hubs like China, Bangladesh and Hong Kong instead of being routed through Germany. Prices are also being slashed by almost 30-40% to bring the brand in line with rivals like Zara, Benetton and Mango.</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Equally dissatisfied</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">It&rsquo;s not only the foreign brands that are unhappy with how their Indian operations are being run. In May 2009, at a luxury conference in Delhi, Mohan Murjani, chairman, Murjani Group, took everyone by surprise when he declared the termination of the Murjani Group&rsquo;s JVs with brands such as Gucci and Jimmy Choo, citing unfavourable terms of trade. Most foreign brands did not partner the Indian owner for losses, but wanted all profits to accrue to them in the form of royalty and profit share. &ldquo;Sadly, brand owners have pursued one-sided and imbalanced agreements, which have now started to unravel,&rdquo; Murjani noted at the conference.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Manufacturing in India has helped in cutting costs, allowing us to maintain a better bottomline" - Rajesh Jain, CEO, Lacoste India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">But some of that problem also stems from the fact that Indian partners oversold the India potential to their own peril. That&rsquo;s the reason DLF Brands snapped its four-year-old ties with Ferragamo and Armani in 2012. &ldquo;We found that we could only open five or six stores for these brands and there isn&rsquo;t much potential for the luxury market over the next five or six years. So, we have decided to focus on mid-market and premium brands such as Mothercare, Alcott and Boggi,&rdquo; says Agarwal. Incidentally, Mothercare is another foreign brand that&rsquo;s switched partners in India &mdash; the British chain came into India through a franchisee agreement with Shoppers Stop but changed to a 30:70 JV with DLF in 2009, which has since been expanded to a 51:49 arrangement in favour of Mothercare.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There&rsquo;s also trouble when the Indian partner underestimates just how deep its pockets need to be to develop a fashion brand. Blues Clothing was started by Dinesh Sehgal in the mid-1990s to sell suiting material from premium international brands such as Cadini and Canali at the family&rsquo;s stores in Delhi&rsquo;s posh South Extension. Since 2005, the company signed on a number of brands such as Corneliani, John Smedley and Versace but has suffered heavy losses. While Versace has moved on to a partnership with Majgenta Fashions, Corneliani has formed a JV with OSL India, which also holds dealerships of BMW and Volkswagen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Unfortunately, the list of failed marriages is a long one when it comes to the luxury business. But the good news is that, despite the stumbling blocks, foreign brands are a long way from breaking ties with the Indian market. M&amp;S plans to open 10 more stores by Summer 2013, its biggest expansion in a single year after having been in the country for over a decade. India is among the four biggest emerging markets for Lacoste globally &mdash; the Indian operations grew 33% last fiscal and Jain is confident of maintaining the pace this year as well. Benetton, Levi&rsquo;s and Max have stuck on over the years and now have turnovers in excess of Rs 650-800 crore. Market research firm Booz &amp; Co expects organised apparel retail &mdash; which accounted for 17% of the $36 billion market in 2010 &mdash; to grow to 25% of the market by 2015 as the apparel retail industry, too, continues to grow by 5-10% in the same period. That means an opportunity of nearly $10 billion awaits apparel industry players who hang around for the next few years. Surely that&rsquo;s reason enough to cultivate a little patience and tolerance.&nbsp;</p>', 'Over 50 foreign fashion brands have split with their local partners in the past five years.

What happened at the Adani Power counter was exactly the opposite. Ahead of its quarter results on January 28, Gautam Adani was busy piling up shares of his company through his holding company Adani Agro. From January 16, when the company announced that it would declare its quarterly results on January 28, till the day of the results, Adani bought 24.45 lakh shares from the open market at an average price of Rs 64.68. If anyone was watching that buying and inferring it was an indication of a good set of numbers in the pipeline, their hopes would have been dashed. The company reported abysmal numbers, nearly doubling its losses from the same quarter previous year. Consolidated total income rose to Rs 1,884 crore from Rs 1,079 crore in the previous year, but consolidated net loss for the quarter stood at Rs 619 crore compared with Rs 356 crore for the same quarter in the previous year, mainly because of rise in imported coal prices and non-availability of transmission lines. On January 28, the stock closed down 5% to settle at Rs 60.90 on the BSE.

Given that the opportunity to profit from price fluctuations between the NSE and the BSE has almost become extinct, most of the existing arbitrage is between the cash and the derivatives segment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Devendra Nevgi, founder, Delta Global, says that last year has been difficult for mutual fund inflows across schemes. &ldquo;In all strategies, the cost of capital is very important. The lack of availability of capital for private arbitrageurs has led to a downturn in the segment.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Goldman Sachs AMC refused to comment for this story, but in an&nbsp; notice issued to investors it stated, &ldquo;The advent of technology has considerably reduced the price anomalies available.

Says Chintan Haria, fund manager, ICICI Prudential AMC (its arbitrage fund had an AUM of Rs 32.14 crore as of Q3FY13), &ldquo;Arbitrage is basically created by people&rsquo;s perception about a particular stock; there will be no dearth of arbitrage opportunities as long as the market remains open.&rdquo; Haria also adds that the Goldman closure might have had more than a technology angle.

Apart from rise in earnings from the refining business, the year-long buyback programme by the company also accounted for the positive outlook among investors and analysts.</p>\n<p class="p3">The buyback concluded on January 19, wherein RIL bought shares worth Rs 3,900 crore (38% of the target&nbsp; #10,440 crore) from shareholders at Rs 870 a share. The process was initiated in February 2012 to bring up the value of its shares, which were under-performing. Over the year, RIL&rsquo;s shares shot up by over 15% and the Sensex grew by almost 20%. That&rsquo;s not great, but a huge improvement considering the under-performance the previous year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With the better-than-expected results delivered by RIL in Q3, many analysts have changed their view on its shares. In a report by Standard Chartered Equity Research, which revised its target price to Rs 879, Rahul Singh indicates a rise in earnings per share (EPS). The report modified its earlier estimates of EPS for FY13 from Rs 60.9 to Rs 62.40 and from Rs 65.5 to Rs 69.7 for FY14. It adds, &ldquo;Operating profit at #83.7 billion (an increase of 15% y-o-y and 9% q-o-q) was driven by higher-than-expected gross refining margins (GRMs) of $9.6 per barrel.&rdquo; As per company reports, the increase in refining margins and prices accounted for 13.7% increase in revenues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Over the last two years, continuous decline in gas production in D6 fields of the Krishna Godavari basin and a near-stalling of exploration led to RIL&rsquo;s under-performance in the market. CLSA&rsquo;s Vikash Jain states in his report, which revised its target price for RIL to Rs 930, that he expects the situation to reverse from 2013, as Reliance negotiates for a gas price hike after the current $4.2 per mmbtu agreement expires in March 2014. &ldquo;Restart of exploration after a near two-year hiatus, rising US shale gas volumes will be other positives for 2013,&rdquo; he reports. RIL&rsquo;s three shale gas JVs in the US accounted for $407 million as revenue for the first three quarters of FY13. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Not just that. RIL&rsquo;s outlook improved considerably with the Veerappa Moily-led oil ministry considering a direct negotiation with the company over arbitration proceedings, which might help the company save over $1 billion. Under Jaipal Reddy, the oil ministry had notified RIL to reduce the cost of developing the KG-D6 field by $1 billion due to the fall in output; RIL then initiated an arbitration proceeding against the ministry in order to recover its costs. In addition, Moily has agreed to accept suggestions made by the Rangarajan committee that will link natural gas prices with international prices. That could actually turn the tide for RIL decisively.

(251, 20, '', 'Topsy-turvy', '<p class="p1">Insider buying and selling is monitored by investors to gauge the financial health of a listed company. That is why the curiosity over promoter selling is much more intense than that caused by promoter buying. However, in the case of real estate company HDIL, the promoter&rsquo;s stake sale seems to be a case of cutting the nose to spite the face. It all started when it was reported that HDIL&rsquo;s vice-chairman Sarang Wadhawan&nbsp;had sold&nbsp;around 50 lakh shares in the market. Now, it was a fairly well-known fact that 96% of the promoter holding was already pledged with various lenders. Naturally, the sale had to happen from whatever free shares the promoter was holding. This development as well as speculation on why such a step was really taken pushed investors to the edge. As a result, over the next few sessions HDIL nearly lost 50% of its market cap from where it had closed on January 21. Given its inability to reduce its high debt, the fear of HDIL going bankrupt was clearly playing on investors&rsquo; minds. When you couple it with the fact that HDIL had never got high marks for its disclosure standards; hawking the family silver, clearly, acquired a whole new context.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While it is too early to say that the dust has settled, the stock price has bounced back from the low of Rs 68 that it hit and is now trading at Rs 80. The entire extent of institutional buying and selling that happened during the carnage will only be clear after the March 2013 quarterly holding is disclosed. From what has been reported so far, Citigroup Global Markets and Credit Suisse were among the prominent sellers. While Credit Suisse seemed to have followed up on the part selling that it did in December, Citigroup Global Markets seems to have sold almost its entire 1% stake that it acquired in September 2012. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Free falling</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Wadhawan may have sold his shares on January 22, but the stock price had already started cracking on the 21st. So an explanation for the mayhem was needed and analysts were clearly worked up as the promoters continued to be tight-lipped. Holding fort on behalf of HDIL now is Hari Prakash Pandey, vice-president, finance, and he brushes aside rumours of a liquidity problem. &ldquo;The shares were sold as an emergency measure to raise Rs 57 crore to fund a land acquisition, which is in its final stages of closure. It was an urgent payment and our internal accruals are tied down for certain bank repayments. We didn&rsquo;t want to default on that, so the promoter sold a 1% stake,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Heavy price paid - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">This explanation is clearly not cutting much ice with the analyst community, which feels that poor governance aside, HDIL has always been bad at disclosures with&nbsp;little or no clarity on cash-flow drivers. Brokerage firm Nirmal Bang has suspended its coverage of the stock after this incident. &ldquo;There has been poor disclosure,&rdquo; says Param Desai, an analyst with Nirmal Bang. &ldquo;The company indicated that they had bought the land more than a year back. Land acquisition is an ongoing process and they were doing the last tranche of payment, but we have never been informed of the land deal.&rdquo; Pandey says the company expects to close approvals for the land soon, after which details of the land acquired will be revealed. For now, the only detail Pandey is willing to part with is that the payment is for a land parcel acquired in&nbsp; South Mumbai more than two years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Anubhav Gupta, analyst at brokerage Kim Eng Securities, says the urgency in making the payment for the land is not clear. &ldquo;I think there must have been some pressure from financiers for debt repayment. Only the management can throw some light on that,&rdquo; he adds. But, surprisingly, the promoters did not participate in the clarificatory conference call that the company held with investors on January 24.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>Clearing the air&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Is a bigger problem being masked here, then, and is the situation indeed so dire that the promoter&rsquo;s hand was forced to raise Rs 57 crore? After all, there is no precedent of selling promoter equity to fund a land purchase. And how does one justify the collateral damage that transpired? After Wadhawan&rsquo;s latest selling bout, the company&rsquo;s market cap collapsed from Rs 5,065 crore to Rs 2,850 crore before recovering to Rs 3,370 crore. In the light of all this, how convincing is the explanation that all this was done to raise Rs 57 crore?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Meanwhile, the damage control at HDIL continues with the company assuring investors that in the next six months, the promoter will buy back the shares he has sold. Well, did the promoter not sell whatever free shares he had a little while ago to raise liquidity, so how he is going to buy it back? Pandey says this is where things are a little mixed up and HDIL has Rs 250 crore as cash and bank balance. That being the case, why did it not fork out Rs 57 crore? Pandey says that he was not informed when the promoter decided to sell his holding and maintains that Wadhawan was sticking to an earlier-decided strategy that the promoter will fund land purchases in his personal capacity and HDIL will conserve cash for debt repayment and for funding projects. If that truly is the case, then it is a strange strategy, given that Wadhawan had sold substantial shares in March 2012 as well. Further, the money raised through the latest stake sale has been lent as an unsecured loan to HDIL and it is not yet clear how the promoters will fund the buy back of shares in six months. In hindsight, Pandey rues, &ldquo;Considering the reaction of the market and the rumours about bankruptcy, the best way to put an end to all this is by redeeming the pledged shares of the promoters.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Waiting to take off- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">While that may help regain confidence, the fact remains that things have not been great at HDIL for a long time now. This isn&rsquo;t the first time the company has had difficulty in arranging funds for a land transaction. Last year, a land owner in Aurangabad&nbsp;terminated a deal with HDIL, after the company&rsquo;s cheque for Rs 7 crore bounced thrice. It is no secret that HDIL&rsquo;s operating cash flow has suffered due to lower floor space index (FSI) sales and slow offtake in residential projects.&nbsp;Then, the Transferable Development Rights (TDR) market, HDIL&rsquo;s mainstay, has completely dried up. In FY10 and FY11, about 94% and 69% of its revenues, respectively, came from TDR sales. TDR is a right given to slum rehabilitation or redevelopment builders to sell or develop built-up area that is lost while undertaking these types of developments.&nbsp;In the last quarter, HDIL did not add any revenue from TDR due to minimal inventory. TDR sales have declined since&nbsp;the Mumbai&nbsp;International Airport&nbsp;(MIAL) project has got stalled due to uncertainty over eligibility of slum dwellers for rehabilitation. HDIL has undertaken the biggest slum rehabilitation project in Mumbai, to relocate 85,000 families for development of MIAL, but work has stopped since Q3FY11. Analysts are hoping that the sluggish TDR market might pick up in the second half of 2013.&nbsp;&ldquo;We believe with their Kurla project getting conversion approval from commercial to residential project, 2 million sq ft of TDR will get generated and monetised in second half of FY13,&rdquo; writes ICICI Securities analyst Shaleen Silori in a recent report.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>Changing tack</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">With a TDR inventory of only 0.1-0.15 million sq ft, HDIL has shifted focus to sale of FSI and asset sales to reduce its consolidated debt of Rs 4,000 crore.&nbsp;Silori says HDIL is targeting FSI sales of 1.5-2 million sq ft per quarter with a realisation of less than Rs 1,000 per sq ft and expects to repay Rs 600 crore of debt by end-FY13. In an FSI sale, instead of developing a plot and selling it to end buyers, builders sell the construction rights to develop that plot to other developers. This is certainly a low risk strategy but the ride has not been smooth here either. Analysts say the company has booked Rs 800-1,000 crore of revenue from FSI sales but of this around Rs 700-800 crore of cash has not been collected. Subsequently, debtor days have gone up from 158 days in FY12 to 373 days in the first half of FY13. &ldquo;HDIL&rsquo;s profit is driven by FSI where cash conversion cycle is much longer, unlike TDR where you get cash upfront,&rdquo; says Nirmal Bang&rsquo;s Desai. &ldquo;Normally, you get cash from FSI sales in three to six months but because of delays in approval or certain milestones that are yet to be achieved, the company has not received money. New launches have also remained subdued over the last 12-15 months impacting cash flows.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Slow motion- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In the face of dismal cash flows, it will be hard for HDIL to repay the Rs 450-500 crore of debt due for repayment in late 2013. Pandey disagrees and says that the company&rsquo;s debt reduction plan is on track. He clarifies, &ldquo;We have converted Rs 800 crore of short-term debt into long term with an eight-year tenure. The first tranche of Rs 300 crore has a moratorium of four years on principal repayment and we intend to reduce debt by 15% every fiscal.&rdquo; Analysts, though, continue to be sceptical about HDIL&rsquo;s debt reduction plan. Kejal Mehta, an analyst with Prabhudas Lilladher, writes in a note that despite the company continually guiding lower on debt reduction, its debt has remained stable at Rs 4,000 crore. &ldquo;In our opinion, debt reduction is purely dependent on debtor realisation of FSI sales, which currently stands at Rs 850-900 crore,&rdquo; says Mehta.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;Corporate governance issues aside, there are lingering concerns over FSI receivables, lacklustre TDR sales, slowdown in other business verticals and debt. No wonder most analysts either have a <em>sell</em> or a<em> reduce </em>rating. &ldquo;When there are other real estate companies with better corporate governance, why should an investor buy HDIL?&rdquo; asks Desai.&nbsp;He likes Prestige Estates for its strong presence in the Bengaluru market. Prabhudas Lilladher and ICICI Securities have a <em>reduce</em> rating, Kim Eng has a <em>neutral</em> rating and Motilal Oswal has put its rating under review. The only positive report is from KC Research, which has a <em>buy</em> on the company with a target of #143.&nbsp;Amit Anwani, analyst, KC Research, says, &ldquo;HDIL still has an edge in the TDR market in Mumbai and once that picks up, it will do well.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>', 'An unexpected promoter stake sale to raise money for finding a land deal raises more questions than answers ', '30', '', 0, '', 'topsy-turvy-251', 246, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Topsy-turvy', 'An unexpected promoter stake sale to raise money for finding a land deal raises more questions than answers ', '', '', '', 'HDIL,Sarang Wadhawan', 0, NULL, '2015-01-27 13:28:44', '2015-01-27 13:46:06', '2013-02-16', 0),

The affable book aficionado, who is the chairman of Chennai-based Polaris Financial Technology, is not partial to the classics, whodunits or how-tos but rather on books rich with spiritual insights. It wasn&rsquo;t always like this. Management was a subject of renewable fascination till, as he read it more and more, Jain found, &ldquo;Management theories and case studies often become obsolete because what is good for one decade doesn&rsquo;t hold good for the next. No book has survived for more than 10 years &mdash; expect, maybe, <em>The Seven Habits of Successful People</em>.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s when he turned his attention to the Indian scriptures. &ldquo;They have lasted for thousands of years so they must have something right,&rdquo; he smiles, explaining why he feels so drawn to spiritual reading.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Learning is a holistic process, Jain says, and it requires the creation of curiosity. &ldquo;I often say that our mind is like a three-bedroom house,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Most of the time, we stay in one room, which becomes our comfort zone, and we don&rsquo;t explore the other spaces or rooms that God has given us.&rdquo; So, he says, our minds are not receptive to new things, and 80% of what others say gets lost in the first stage (perception).

Soon, the four-hour session became the most sought-after training programme within Polaris. Jain rues that only rituals come to the mind when we speak of spirituality, even though the Indian scriptures are aligned to asking questions. &ldquo;I call the <em>Bhagvad Gita</em> the FAQs on life not only because it&rsquo;s written in a Q&amp;A format but because we can find answers to some of the most difficult questions in it,&rdquo; he says with absolute conviction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Much can be learnt from the West as well, Jain adds, &ldquo;I admire their research and design capabilities, and ability to communicate.&rdquo; Indeed, he feels that the weakest link in the Indian scriptures is their focus on self-learning, not dissemination.

But I also find history a rich source of broader perspective, a mirror to human action. Indeed, one must often look at the past to understand contemporary events better. Pankaj Mishra&rsquo;s <em>From the Ruins of Empire: The Revolt Against the West and the Remaking of Asia</em> provides a fascinating narrative to do this. The book, which has been released with a more precise sub-heading in the US (&lsquo;<em>The Intellectuals Who Remade Asia</em>&rsquo;), has an ambitious canvas that reflects Mishra&rsquo;s bold stature as an intellectual and commentator. It posits that the ascension of China, the ongoing tensions between the Asian superpower and Japan, extremism in Islamic states, the turmoil in Egypt, and many other such current events of global import, may all have their roots in the Victorian period. This intriguing analysis is founded on the decimation or subjugation of the great empires of the East by the soldiers and merchants of the West. The list of examples Mishra provides is long &mdash; the rise of the Mughal Empire in India; the forced opium trade in China and burning of the Summer Palace in Beijing; the catalysis of Japan&rsquo;s modernisation in the late nineteenth century...</p>\n<p class="p3">What may have turned the tables so dramatically in the last 50 years, Mishra explains brilliantly, are the ideas of some of the lesser-known thinkers of the East: the Persian-born liberal-turned-revolutionary Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, the Chinese intellectual Liang Qichao, and Rabindranath Tagore, whom Mishra casts in new and powerful light. The author not only chronicles the life and views of this disparate triumvirate with rigour, he traces their influence on contemporary geopolitics convincingly. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Throughout the book, Mishra&rsquo;s prognosis is not sanguine. Internally diverse societies like India may not be able to find a social, political and cultural identity without violence and disorder. In fact, the European model of the ethnically homogeneous nation state is a poor fit in Europe itself, and a pan-European body like the European Union is going through severe stress today. In India and China, the pursuit of economic growth at all costs has led to the creation of a&nbsp; &ldquo;gaudy elite&rdquo;, widening social and economic disparities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">What are the unintended consequences of India&rsquo;s growth? Mishra offers many insights that are worth mulling over. Here, let me leave you with Tagore&rsquo;s poignant and timeless warning against the &ldquo;special modern enthusiasm for Western progress and force.&rdquo; Tagore puts it, well, poetically: &ldquo;We have for over a century been dragged by the prosperous West behind its chariot, choked by the dust, deafened by the noise, humbled by our own helplessness, and overwhelmed by the speed. We agreed to acknowledge that this chariot drive was progress, and that progress was civilisation. If we ever ventured to ask &lsquo;progress towards what, and ... for whom?&rsquo; it was considered to be peculiarly Oriental ... [yet] of late, a voice has come to us bidding to take count not only of the scientific perfection of the chariot but of the depth of the ditches lying across its path.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Insights</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">A rich man''s world?

(257, 20, '', 'Pipe dreams', '<p class="p1">State governments doling out cheap power is commonplace. During election time, they even promise free power &mdash; and we&rsquo;re used to that, too. Now, here&rsquo;s a government that&rsquo;s making promises at the other end of the spectrum &mdash; expensive power &mdash; and, what is even more surprising is that it is being welcomed with open arms. The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) has recently cleared an initiative that will offer consumers electricity at a steep Rs 9-11 a unit, three times higher than the average pooled cost (Rs 3 a unit). Mind you, this is the same administration that gives free electricity to farmers. So, just what&rsquo;s going on?</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>Out of gas</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">There&rsquo;s a background to the decision to generate expensive power. Andhra Pradesh has the largest stock of gas-based power units &mdash; eight plants with a combined capacity of over 3,000 MW &mdash; that were planned and set up with the idea of using gas from Reliance Industries&rsquo; KG-D6 basin. More plants were planned, but they&rsquo;ve been put on hold for the time being.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">That&rsquo;s because against the initial plans of producing 86.73 million metric standard cubic meter per day (mmscmd) of gas every day, production at KG-D6 has been declining rapidly since 2011. In October 2012, daily production was just 29.81 mmscmd and is expected to further drop to 24 mmscmd in FY14 and 20 mmscmd the following year. Had the KG basin been producing to its full potential, the total domestic gas production by FY15 would have been 178 mmscmd; currently in FY13, production is expected to be around 104 mmscmd, increasing slightly to 112 mmscmd by FY15.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">With the KG basin producing far less than anticipated, all gas-based plants in the state (and many outside AP as well) are operating at half their capacity. And while assets on the ground are operating at below 50% their plant load factor (PLF), the PLF of newer plants in the state is half of even this diminished production level. Indeed, the 445 MW Konaseema Gas Power, set up in 2010, has already defaulted in payments to lenders and the company is in talks with its bankers for corporate debt restructuring.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">While the plants were planned on the basis of KG basin gas, the same can also run on other forms of fuel including imported liquefied natural gas (LNG). In the current fiscal, LNG imports will rise to 73 mmscmd from around 46 mmscmd in FY12; the figure will jump to 105 mmscmd by FY14, according to oil ministry projections, which will match domestic gas production. LNG imports into India are done on the basic of long, medium and short term contracts as well as on spot purchase basis. But, where the KG basin gas price has been fixed at $4.2/million metric British thermal units (mmbtu) until April 2014, internationally, spot prices of regassified LNG (RLNG) have increased from $7-8/mmbtu to around $17/mmbtu in the past four years. Isaac George, CFO of GVK Power and Infrastructure, points out that at $4.2/mmbtu, power tariff works out to around #3 a unit. Obviously, then, using imported gas will mean a three-fold hike in electricity rates.</p>\n<p class="p5">But with Andhra reeling under a severe power crisis &mdash; against an energy requirement of 95,000 million units, the state was able to provide about 82,000 million units, leaving a deficit of over 12,000 million units &mdash; last August, distribution companies along with industry floated the idea of using LNG power. And, in January this year, APERC identified four plants of around 1,500 MW &mdash; GVK Gautami (464 MW), GVK Extension (220 MW), GMR Vemagiri (370 MW) and Konaseema &mdash; that will run their plants on RLNG.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>Paying a premium&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Not surprisingly, the plan has raised quite a few eyebrows. Asks SL Rao, former chairman of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), &ldquo;Why select these four plants? And who will regulate the price of LNG in the first place?&rdquo; APERC declined to comment on the issue but the power regulator&rsquo;s order says these plants have been selected as their station heat rate (the amount of heat energy generated to produce electrical energy) is lower than others and can generate RLNG-based power at lower variable cost. George adds that these are the four biggest gas plants in AP that are currently running on low PLF. &ldquo;With industry being forced to work only two days a week and power cuts expected to range for six to nine hours in the capital, there was no way out but to use RLNG and increase power generation in the state,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p5">Certainly, industry is interested in the idea. MV Rajeshwara Rao, secretary general of the Federation of Andhra Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FAPCCI), says there is already demand for around 300 MW of LNG-based power, adding that spinning mills, BPOs and some commercial establishments have come forward for this new scheme. &ldquo;The scheme isn&rsquo;t meant for cement and steel industries, which need cheaper power,&rdquo; he points out; rather, it is for those who need continuous power. For such industries, diesel gensets, where power costs nearly Rs 15 a unit, are a far more expensive and unreliable option. Indeed, a recent Ficci study points out that 61% of companies using power back-up units &ldquo;suffer above 10% cost escalation due to power cuts&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">Traditionally, independent power producers secure fuel supplies for their plants. In this case, though, the state government-owned APTransco, along with Gas Authority of India (one of the main importers of RLNG in India), will arrange for procurement of RLNG. &ldquo;APTransco will arrange for the RLNG and in all likelihood, this will come from the west coast as there are no LNG terminals on the east coast,&rdquo; says George.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">The state-owned distribution companies will procure electricity from the four plants on a no-profit-no-loss basis. APERC has also put together a separate set of calculations on how RLNG-based power is to be billed. While industry offtake of RLNG will be around 300 MW, there is talk that increased generation can also be used for other purposes, including agriculture supply given that the <em>rabi</em> season is just round the corner. Certainly, there is planned generation of more RLNG power than industry currently needs. Where FAPCCI estimates of demand till mid-January was some 300 MW (that is 2,600 million units), the state discoms have proposed buying 6,000 million units (over 600 MW) of RLNG electricity for FY14. This sale of around Rs 6,000 crore, if permitted by the regulator, will bring down Andhra&rsquo;s power deficit substantially. But that&rsquo;s only the tip of the iceberg. If it works at all, there is a much larger connotation to the scheme.</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>The big picture</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">If there are takers for RLNG-based power, then the scheme can be extrapolated across the country and other gas-based capacities in the country, too, can run at higher PLF. In FY12, paucity of gas ensured that the 20,000 MW of gas-based power plants in India received less than 70% of the gas required, resulting in a loss of generation of over 10,000 million units. The multi-billion dollar 5 mmtpa LNG terminal at Dabhol has been idle since 2005, when Gail-NTPC took over the project (first shipment of nominal LNG received in January of 2013). One reason (not openly admitted, though) is that LNG prices have shot up in the past few years and LNG-based power would have proved too expensive to sell. Meanwhile, the associated power plant with the Dabhol project had started generation using domestic gas at around $6/mmbtu, resulting in a tariff of #3.9/unit. However, with shortage of domestic gas, power generation has dropped at the plant. Still, the perception that there are no takers for expensive power has changed. &ldquo;If there are customers willing to pay a higher price, then assets such as that at Dabhol, which is running at one-third capacity, can be better used,&rdquo; points out Vinayak Chatterjee, chairman and managing director of Feedback Infra. He further says, &ldquo;The Andhra scheme attempts to segregate the consumer market by identifying customers who are willing to pay higher rates for assured supply.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p5">That&rsquo;s not all. Andhra&rsquo;s RLNG initiative is also in line with the Rangarajan committee recommendations on production-sharing contracts and gas pricing. Moving away from the current administered pricing mechanism based pricing, the committee in December 2012 recommended that domestic gas pricing should be benchmarked or aligned with international prices.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">Meanwhile, discoms themselves are seeking higher retail tariffs from customers. In their recent tariff proposal, Andhra distribution companies have stated that they would have to purchase additional power at a marginal cost of Rs 10 a unit. Accordingly, they have sought a hike in tariffs, especially of domestic consumers, by altering the slab rate &mdash; their suggestion is that people consuming over 500 units should pay over #7 a unit on their total consumption, compared with the earlier scheme of being charged different rate for different slabs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">Perhaps the most significant implication of the Andhra experiment is for domestic gas prices. If there are takers for power derived from expensive RLNG, is it time to raise domestic gas prices? While the government has moved a Cabinet note on reviewing domestic gas pricing along the lines of the Rangarajan committee recommendations, officials say there will be no change in KG basic gas price until April 2014. On its part, Reliance Industries wants domestic gas prices to be market determined, a provision that exists in the production sharing contract. Ironically, before this new initiative by the Andhra government, the Association of Power Producers had last year opposed a hike in gas prices, stating that every dollar increase in gas prices would hike domestic tariffs by 35 paise a unit. Now, says George, &ldquo;In principle, fuel prices should be indexed to international prices&rdquo;, adding that bringing LNG by pipeline from the west coast to the east will hike the cost to about $22/mmbtu. Still, as Chatterjee says, &ldquo;If the market is prepared to pay a price aligned with international prices, so be it.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>', 'Andhra Pradesh''s decision to allow power generation using imported gas could have far-reaching implications — for power producers and domestic gas companies', '24', '', 0, '', 'pipe-dreams-257', 252, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Pipe dreams', 'Andhra Pradesh''s decision to allow power generation using imported gas could have far-reaching implications — for power producers and domestic gas companies', '', '', '', 'Power supply,Andhra Pradesh', 0, NULL, '2015-01-27 14:56:00', '2015-01-27 15:13:12', '2013-02-16', 0),

One irate customer had remarked that there was a huge opening in the market for someone who with a product at the right price. &ldquo;It was like a slap on my face for not seeing the business opportunity in customer support, especially since I had been building on-premise helpdesk systems since 2004 at Zoho,&rdquo; recalls 37-year-old Mathrubootham, who was a vice-president at the Chennai-based CRM company at the time.</p>\n<p class="p3">Over the next couple of weeks, Mathrubootham researched the companies in the space and took the usual, tech route to entrepreneurship &mdash; zeroed in on the domain name, roped in a co-founder (Shan Krishnasamy) and then quit his regular job.

It also gave Freshdesk insights into the customer segment it needed to go target: small and medium businesses.</p>\n<p class="p3">In June 2011, Freshdesk was formally launched, after all chinks had been ironed out following customer feedback on the beta version. Within just two days, Freshdesk had its first paying customer, from Australia. &ldquo;We changed the game by doing all our marketing on the internet. We don&rsquo;t have white papers &mdash; we make online demos and offer customer free 30-day trials of the product,&rdquo; says Mathrubootham. Even today, the company offer a freemium model where the first agent can sign up free of cost. (In this model, the company lets the first agent use the product for free and charges subsequent users). It has currently 2,800 customers, including Dell, MakeMyTrip, Naukri, Pearson and Toshiba managed by a 65 member team.</p>\n<p class="p3">So, what does the product do? Essentially, it integrates traditional support channels such as phone and e-mail with social channels such as Twitter and Facebook. The software converts a phone call or an e-mail interaction or a complaint on Twitter or Facebook into a ticket that the company needs to respond to. &ldquo;We were the first to integrate social media with traditional media because companies want to go where customers are,&rdquo; says Krishnasamy. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Every ticket is routed to a team inbox where the query can be assigned support agent who then resolves the query. The responses are directly posted on Twitter and Facebook. Besides measuring the time spent on each ticket, the platforms give analytical insights which help fix recurring customer problems. It has also developed a software development kit for mobile (iOS) app developers to help improve customer support within mobile applications.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Pricing is based on the services provided &mdash; support only through e-mail and phone versus a plan that includes social media support &mdash; and the number of customer-supporting agents. The services offer range from $9 to $49 per agent per month. So, if an organisation chooses the $9 plan, for instance, and has five customer support agents, it will pay $45 a month.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Investors&rsquo; delight</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Unlike most start-ups, for Freshdesk finding investors was just as easy as finding customers. In early 2011, the company also listed itself on Angel List, a platform for start-ups and investors to come together. Soon enough, potential investors, including private equity fund Accel Partners, started checking out the company. In June 2011, the first validation of the business model came when Freshdesk won the Microsoft Biz Spark India Start up challenge, beating over 400 companies to win $40,000.</p>\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"If they could build a world class product using India as an advantage, they could give a fight in the market" - Shekhar Kirani, partner, Accel Partners</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">It was right about then Shekar Kirani and the team at Accel Partners decided to invest in Freshdesk. The firm decided to back Freshdesk and invested $1 million in October 2011. &ldquo;We felt if they could build a world-class product using India as an advantage, they could give a fight in the market,&rdquo; says Shekhar Kirani, Partner at Accel Partners. As business started to scale with 700 customers signing up, the second round of funding came within the next six months with Tiger Global and Accel Partners investing another $5 million together in April 2012.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Future&rsquo;s bright</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Tech consultancy Gartner says social CRM is almost a $1-billion market today and by 2016, it predicts 50% of CRM applications will be web-based and delivered through the cloud. But even as the opportunities ahead seem promising, there is competition to be tackled as well. Leading players include California-based Zendesk, a $30-million company that serves more than 25,000 customers, and desk, which is part of enterprise cloud computing major Salesforce.&nbsp; &ldquo;B2B is not a winner-takes-all market. As long as you differentiate, and carve your niche in a segment, there is room for good players,&rdquo; says Mathrubootham.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Accel&rsquo;s Kirani feels the segment Freshdesk operates in puts it on an even wicket with bigger players. &ldquo;In the SMB market Freshdesk is targeting, people don&rsquo;t decide without going for a trial. Once Girish gets them on a trial, if his product outshines the others for a given price point and feature set, most likely they will choose him.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Freshdesk, which is incorporated in the US, doesn&rsquo;t share revenue figures but says income has grown more than 100 times in 2012.&nbsp; However sources say that the company has crossed the million dollar mark in revenues in 2012. Though it is many times lower than Zendesk, which is expected to triple its revenue to nearly $100 million by 2014 &mdash; which means there&rsquo;s more than enough room for Freshdesk to grow. &ldquo;If anyone is talking about your company, be it on LinkedIn, Twitter or blogs, you should be the first one to know and the first person to respond. That&rsquo;s the power we want to give companies,&rdquo; says Mathrubootham. In this age of instant gratification, companies definitely need that kind of power.&nbsp;</p>', 'With its cloud-based offering, Freshdesk helps its clients address customer issues promptly ', '6', '', 0, '', 'delighting-customers-259', 254, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Delighting customers', 'With its cloud-based offering, Freshdesk helps its clients address customer issues promptly ', '', '', '', 'CRM software,Freshdesk,B2B Helpdesk,Customer support', 0, NULL, '2015-01-27 15:53:11', NULL, '2013-03-02', 0),
(260, 12, '', 'Music to their ears', '<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A</span>t 18, you&rsquo;d naturally expect Samarth Swarup&rsquo;s latest indulgence to be a fancy smartphone. Instead, it&rsquo;s a Yamaha APX700 acoustic guitar. At Rs 40,000, a tidy sum for this Class XII student at the Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan Vidyashram in Jaipur, the Yamaha is one in a line of six guitars and three keyboards Swarup accumulated over the past few years. These, and an amplifier, set him back by a cool #1.25 lakh. &ldquo;Most of it was my own money,&rdquo; he says, of the savings he made from tutoring others on the guitar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Evidently, this isn&rsquo;t just the impulsive splurge of an affluent teenager. Swarup&rsquo;s collection is for a purpose. Helped by friends, the self-taught musician is working on a solo music album titled <em>Teri Yaadein</em>, and his first single recently released on the internet.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">People like Swarup make sellers of musical instruments in India happy. Many of them are seriously eyeing a career in music, others are out to have some serious fun. Young and passionate about Western music, they lap up everything from high-end guitars to top-of-the-line keyboards and drums. And, unlike in the past, they have big brands in the business literally knocking at their doors. For Swarup, the Yamaha Music Square in his city&rsquo;s Mansarovar locality made the decision a lot easier. He could try out guitars in the store&rsquo;s sound-proof rooms before making his purchase. &ldquo;The sound is the most important factor in a guitar and this store had the one I was looking for,&rdquo; says Swarup.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Bittersweet melodies&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Homegrown retailers and global manufacturers like Yamaha, Casio, Roland, Fender and Pearl are tuning in to such customer insights, and ramping up on distribution and marketing. Yamaha, which was previously selling through local importers, opened its first experiential store in 2008. &ldquo;That year, we decided that India was an important destination and launched the Yamaha Music Square stores,&rdquo; says Tarun Sehgal, regional manager (west), Yamaha Music India. Today, 17 such outlets mark their presence in second tier cities such as Kochi, Indore, Lucknow, Shillong, Jaipur and Guwahati.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Figures for the size of the Indian musical instruments market are hard to come by. That&rsquo;s not surprising. &ldquo;This is a very new industry for all of us,&rdquo; says Anthony Gomes, partner at BX Furtado &amp; Sons in Mumbai, which set up shop 147 years ago. He tells us that Western musical instruments like the piano, keyboard, guitar and drums drive most of the demand now, thanks to a shifting cultural context. &ldquo;It is the result of MTV and Channel V. Customers are hugely influenced by what they watch,&rdquo; he says. TechSci Research, a Noida-based market research firm, has estimated this segment at #370 crore in revenues (2011).</p>\n<p class="p3">Not too long ago, the business served a small but informed community of music professionals and students, and margins were modest. Things are different now. Brijesh Bhargava, director, Bharagava&rsquo;s Musik, a leading music distributor and retailer in Mumbai, recalls how a decision, in 1998, to import 300 guitars from China for the firm&rsquo;s own brand GBA almost blew up in his face. Priced at Rs 3,000 apiece, a princely sum those days, they took a year to sell. &ldquo;We ultimately made only Rs 40 a piece,&rdquo; he says ruefully.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;&ldquo;Today, we sell about 10 times that number each month, at just about the same price,&rdquo; says Bhargava. Falling import duties, from 300% to 60% in 1998 and to 23% now, have made prices affordable. Gomes adds that 90% of products sold such as guitars, keyboards, drums and pianos, are imported from the US, China, Indonesia and Japan, and lowered duties make a huge difference. One could acquire a good guitar for Rs 5,000, a violin for Rs 4,500, and a feature-rich synthesiser keyboard for Rs 10,000.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s a pie that&rsquo;s growing but at the cost of Indian instruments. &ldquo;Sales for Indian instruments have dropped by 50% each year,&rdquo; says Bhargava. At his western Mumbai outlet, the <em>tabla</em>, flute and harmonium occupy a small portion of products on display. Buyers for these are typically in the 40-50 year age bracket. A good quality Indian flute costs just Rs 700 while a <em>tabla</em> set comes for Rs 6,500. &ldquo;People think it&rsquo;s not cool to be seen with those,&rdquo; Bhargava explains. No one&rsquo;s complaining, though. At Furtados Music, the retail enterprise of Furtados Group, revenues have been climbing 25% annually on the back of Western instrument sales, according to managing director Phillip Rodrigues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Sales for Indian instruments have dropped by 50% a year. People think it''s not cool to be seen with those" - Brijesh Bhargava, director, Bharagava''s Musik</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">So who&rsquo;s buying? Parents looking to gift their children, middle-age professionals seeking to rekindle a long-cherished dream, and hobbyists among others. Many are first-time customers and importantly, they have the money to spare. Rodrigues remembers how a forty-something couple once walked into his Juhu outlet to buy picks (used to pluck or strum strings) for their son. After browsing around, they bought a piano worth Rs 1.5 lakh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>Beyond expectations</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">If there&rsquo;s newfound optimism in the industry, it&rsquo;s mostly due to the opportunity unfolding in small-town India. &ldquo;The growth rate in tier 2 cities is higher than in the metros,&rdquo; affirms Karan Chechi, research director, TechSci Research. Furtados Music is a case in point. Till 2007, it had two stores each in Mumbai and Goa. Since then, it has expanded to Ahmedabad, Mangalore, Dimapur and Ludhiana, among other locations. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t expect Ahmedabad to be a large market when we opened there last year. In almost no time, we had sold two pianos for Rs 2 lakh and Rs 5 lakh each,&rdquo; says Rodrigues.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We didn''t expect Ahmedabad to be a large market until we sold two pianos worth Rs 7 lakh in no time" - Phillip Rodrigues, MD, Furtados Music</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Contemporary cinema and television shows have played their part. And backed by higher disposable incomes, music has become an acceptable career choice or at least a creatively satisfying pursuit. &ldquo;It is clear that parents want their children to learn music,&rdquo; says Rodrigues. Live music shows too help promote interest, according to Sehgal. &ldquo;IT hubs such as Bengaluru and Hyderabad are seeing a greater orientation towards music, which is good news,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Sahil Makhija, 30, is a professional musician associated with four heavy metal bands in Mumbai. As the founder of Demonstealer Records, an independent record label based in Mumbai, he&rsquo;s often juggling his recording studio, organising bookings for other bands, and drumming up support for the genre. His bands perform in smaller centres like Jalandhar, Anand, Dhanbad and Silchar, where they are popular among young student audiences. Makhija owes his success in large measure to the internet and its role in opening up niche, and sometimes obscure, music genres to young Indians in every corner of the country. Heavy metal requires high-end guitars and drums, which often cost a packet and are not easily available here, says Makhija. &ldquo;Duties are very high and we still have to procure instruments from overseas.&rdquo; But he hopes that&rsquo;ll change soon.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"IT hubs such as Bengaluru and Hyderabad are seeing a greater orientation towards music" - Tarun Sehgal, regional manager (West), Yamaha Music India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Online retail is picking up, but the bulk of buying continues to take place in the physical stores. &ldquo;Last year, 10% of our business came from the online channel and this included high-end guitars that cost at least Rs 20,000. That is a big opportunity,&rdquo; says Rodrigues, who expects online sales to contribute twice as much in the near future.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Everyone&rsquo;s invited</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">There&rsquo;s been little advertising given that the business serves to a limited audience. Instead, community building is the most effective market development tool. Furtados brings in artists from abroad to perform and conduct workshops. It has roped in leading Indian names like Lucky Ali and Usha Uthup for its artiste endorsement programme. &ldquo;We recently started an &lsquo;Open Mic&rsquo; event, where local musicians and singers can perform spontaneously to a live audience. We promote young bands and local music under our Support the Artistes initiative,&rdquo; says Rodrigues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">TechSci&rsquo;s Chechi sees good times for this industry ahead. &ldquo;In the next five years, we expect an increase in the number of musicians to boost demand. E-retailing and a rising number of music schools will also be key growth drivers,&rdquo; he says. Yamaha is replicating its global Music Schools Program, and building partnerships with music schools here. A pilot project in Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Chennai and Bengaluru is currently on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Meanwhile, Swarup cannot wait to complete his MBA, by which time he&rsquo;d have saved enough to acquire his dream guitars &mdash; a Gibson Hummingbird (Rs 3 lakh) and a Gibson J-200 (Rs 5 lakh). Who knows, by then, he could buy them for a song.&nbsp;</p>', 'The western musical instruments industry is poised to enter its most exciting phase', '7', '', 0, '', 'music-to-their-ears-260', 255, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Music to their ears', 'The western musical instruments industry is poised to enter its most exciting phase', '', '', '', 'Western musical instruments,Yamaha,Casio,Roland,Fender,Pearl,Furtados Music,Bharagava''s Musik', 0, NULL, '2015-01-27 15:54:35', '2015-01-27 16:28:50', '2013-03-02', 0),
(261, 16, '', 'A tricky call', '<p class="p1">Timing is everything. For operators negotiating the current Indian telecom quagmire, this seems to be the perfect time for something they&rsquo;ve been putting off for sometime &mdash; increasing call rates. It&rsquo;s the first time since mid-2009 that effective call rates are going up as telcos start to snip away bonus talk time and discounted recharge vouchers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There are enough reasons why this makes sense now. Competition is far lower. Key players such as Etisalat (in a JV with the Dynamix Balwa group), C Sivasankaran&rsquo;s S Tel and Loop Telecom (owned by the Ruias of Essar) have exited the business amidst charges of corruption and cancelling of 122 licences across India. Others have scaled down their operations in select circles. Uninor stopped acquiring new subscribers in Kerala, Karnataka, Orissa and Tamil Nadu since August last year after the regulatory uncertainty around fresh auction of spectrum and its pricing impaired the firm&rsquo;s ability to secure funding for expansion. Videocon shut down operations in 11 circles where the Supreme Court cancelled licences in January 2012. It subsequently won spectrum in five of those circles in the November 2012 auction. From up to 14 operators in some circles during the peak of the telecom boom, the number is down to eight or nine now.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The purchase of costly spectrum through the November 2012 auction has put the additional pressure of bank loans and interest charges on companies&rsquo; groaning finances. Some cite the hike in diesel prices, used to power telecom towers, as another factor. Passing on the burden to customers, therefore, seemed inevitable.</p>\n<p class="p3">Airtel kicked off the hike in January when it reduced free talk time for pre-paid customers by up to 25% and doubled call rates to Rs 2 per minute. Then, Idea hiked its rates from 1.2 paisa to 2 paisa per second, a 67% jump. Vodafone followed suit. Operators say eventually all circles and subscribers will be covered. But&nbsp; will this improve operators&rsquo; bottomlines? &ldquo;It will lead to a lot of savings for them. The cumulative impact could be 1.5-2 paise on the average realisation per minute (ARPM),&rdquo; says Rikesh Parikh, vice-president, equities, Motilal Oswal Securities. Airtel&rsquo;s ARPM stood at 42.5 paise in Q3FY13 while for Idea it was 41.1 paise. These numbers stayed unchanged from the previous quarter because call rates had been plummeting though usage was going up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">That could change now, says Sahil Aggarwal, analyst at India Ratings. &ldquo;It will lead to an improvement in operating performance, and partly offset the negative impact of recent regulatory developments,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">So far, a handful of circles, including Mumbai and Delhi, have been chosen for the call rate hikes. Raising tariffs in the age of number portability has its risks. Airtel and Idea had upped tariffs by approximately 20% in mid-2011 but had to roll back quickly after customers migrated to rival networks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Almost 99% of India&rsquo;s mobile market comprises prepaid connections. Millions of these subscribers, weaned on a regime of perpetual discounts and rock-bottom tariffs, will no doubt find the new rates a dampener. But for an industry struggling to emerge from the unprofitable depths it has been driven to, there is not much choice if it has to survive.&nbsp;</p>', 'Will hiking call rates prove a sustainable strategy for telecom operators', '33', '', 0, '', 'a-tricky-call-261', 256, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'A tricky call', 'Will hiking call rates prove a sustainable strategy for telecom operators', '', '', '', 'Hiking call rates,Telecom,Airtel,Vodafone,Idea Cellular', 0, NULL, '2015-01-27 16:30:04', '2015-01-27 16:37:01', '2013-03-02', 0),
(262, 16, '', 'Makeover', '<p class="p1">Sometime in 2001, a visiting friend from the US suggested Harsh Mariwala buy into a laser hair removal business. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t that excited &mdash; it&rsquo;s an easily copied model,&rdquo; recalls the chairman and managing director of Marico. Expanding the idea to skincare, though, seemed more promising. Recce trips to dermatologists&rsquo; clinics and high-end beauty salons in the US and the UK convinced Mariwala this was an idea worth incubating. Less than a year after his friend&rsquo;s visit, he opened the first Kaya Skin Clinic at Bandra &mdash; the medi-spa combined zen-like interiors, a signature welcome drink and trained staff in designer uniforms with in-house dermatologists and space-age sounding skincare treatments.</p>\n<p class="p4">Now, Kaya has expanded to 105 clinics across India, West and South East Asia. It earned nearly Rs 280 crore last year and is believed to be the largest recruiter of dermatologists in the country. But the good news ends there. After more than a decade, the business is still to show a full-year profit (it&rsquo;s just started making a modest quarterly profit). Parent company Marico has incurred a loss of Rs 145 crore on it and has finally thrown in the towel. From April, Kaya will be demerged from the consumer products business and operate independently as Marico Kaya Enterprises (MaKe). By mid-July, after obtaining all necessary approvals from Sebi, MaKe will be listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange as well as the National Stock Exchange. While Mariwala will continue as CMD of both entities, MaKe will have a separate board. Marico will transfer all its assets and liabilities in Kaya &mdash; including capital of Rs 180 crore &mdash; to MaKe. After that, it&rsquo;s on its own.</p>\n<p class="p4">But why has a seemingly good idea failed to take off? And, more importantly, what will it take for the business to succeed as an independent entity?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Pock-marked past</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">You do not have to look far for reasons why Kaya did not click. &ldquo;The business is cluttered, with unorganised players who do not play by the same rules. This has made it harder to grow the business and increase footfalls and has also dented our profit &amp; loss,&rdquo; grouses Ajay Pahwa, the outgoing CEO of Kaya, further adding that high real estate and rental costs added a 6-7% drag on margins. Mariwala lists another factor: attrition. &ldquo;Perhaps we also expanded a little too fast,&rdquo; he adds reflectively.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>More than skin deep- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">Between 2003 and 2005, Kaya opened 20 outlets across India. It ventured overseas in 2006 and followed that up with a domestic expansion overdrive over the next two years, opening 25 clinics in quick succession in both, metros as well as tier 1 and tier 2 towns such as Nashik, Indore, Coimbatore and Vishakapatnam. (It currently has 83 outlets across India.) The positioning, pricing and brand proposition remained unchanged, though, and customers in smaller towns proved unwilling to pay Kaya&rsquo;s premium rates. Indeed, expensive services were an issue even in the big cities. &ldquo;Customers shell out up to #60,000 for a complete skincare package from Kaya, which is three times more than what competitors charge,&rdquo; says CK Kumaravel, co-founder and MD of Naturals Beauty Salon, a 202 store and #150 crore turnover-strong South India-based salon and spa chain.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>"Kaya was known more for its skin cure solutions, while beauty products play a key role in acquiring customers" - Vandana Luthra, founder, VLCC</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">Even Kaya&rsquo;s positioning as a skin &ldquo;clinic&rdquo; backfired &mdash; customers turned up only for skin problems and didn&rsquo;t return for routine beauty treatments. Also, because most people don&rsquo;t want to admit to having skin problems, Kaya didn&rsquo;t get the benefit of word-of-mouth referrals, a key requirement in this business. &ldquo;The brand was known more for its skin cure solutions,&rdquo; agrees Vandana Luthra, founder of beauty, skincare and weight loss chain VLCC. &ldquo;There was very little emphasis on products back then and beauty products play a key role in acquiring customers.&rdquo; To be fair, Kaya did try to set things right and revamp its business model &mdash; but it&rsquo;s not worked so far.</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Lather, rinse, repeat</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In 2006, Kaya stepped beyond the clinic format and opened Skin Zones in select malls. These information kiosks offered counselling on skincare and helped build brand awareness and reach among target customers. And following the slowdown in FY09, it also expanded its repertoire to offer &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, more affordable beauty treatments such as facials. Of course, this strategy came with its own set of problems &mdash; now, Kaya was in direct competition with neighbourhood beauty parlours, which were cheaper, more conveniently located near customers&rsquo; homes (Kaya&rsquo;s clinics are typically in posh market areas such as Delhi&rsquo;s Khan Market and Bandra in Mumbai). Moreover, these &ldquo;affordable&rdquo; services meant the average billing per customer would drop, making it that much more difficult for the store to break even. It didn&rsquo;t help that the FY13 Budget imposed a 12.3% service tax on skincare and wellness services, impacting all organised players in the space, including Naturals, Hindustan Unilever&rsquo;s Lakm&eacute; Salons (which aren&rsquo;t doing too well, either) and Kaya. Industry sources estimate that each Kaya outlet needed about 400-450 customers a month, with average billing of Rs 7,000 each. Instead, what it achieved was an average bill value of Rs 5,000 for about 300-400 customers every month. For the industry as a whole, fixed costs comprise 55% of the total costs of a store while variable costs constitute the remaining 45%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Customers have to shell out three times more for a skincare package from Kaya than what their competitors charge" - CK Kumaravel, co-founder and MD, Natural Spa Salons</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">Starting last year, Kaya made a determined effort to communicate that it was more than a skin cure treatment provider. The brand changed its tagline from &ldquo;Let your skin talk&rdquo; to &ldquo;Love what you see&rdquo;, to emphasise it was more beauty salon and less dermatology clinic. The clinics were also remodelled to reflect this changed positioning &mdash; the clinical beige gave way to more-stylish burgundy and rounded edges were introduced to exude warmth and care. As part of the campaign, Kaya also introduced the &ldquo;wall of beauty&rdquo; initiative, where customers were encouraged to post testimonials on the brand&rsquo;s website &mdash; so far, some 592,133 women have uploaded their images and feedback. Indeed, Kaya&rsquo;s efforts on the net have perhaps been more effective than its traditional media campaigns &mdash; which have had middle-rung celebrity endorsers such as Pooja Bedi, Riddhima Kapoor and now, Giselle Monteiro. Kaya is fairly active on social media, based on insights that its target customer spends a lot of time online, with the result that its Facebook page has over 186,000 &ldquo;likes&rdquo; and close to 2,000 followers on Twitter (twice as many as VLCC, incidentally).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Skincare- Image</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">Perhaps the biggest challenge for Kaya has been to keep a lid on costs. Since it pays its higher-than market wages in a bid to minimise attrition &mdash; about Rs 20,000-25,000, according to industry estimates &mdash; Kaya has now started moving staff between centres in a city depending on the demand for services, rather than hire at peak-demand level for every centre. Still, attrition remains a challenge &mdash; Mariwala complains that many dermatologists leave Kaya to set up competing skin clinics of their own. The lack of an incentive structure is also to blame, says Kumaravel. &ldquo;Employees are constantly under pressure to deliver and they aren&rsquo;t being rewarded for good performance,&rdquo; he points out. Now, Kaya is hoping that reducing its dependence on services &mdash; and therefore, staff &mdash; will help it finally turn around.</p>\n<p class="p4">In December, the brand announced a new format that will cut costs and drive penetration. At 500-700 sq ft, the Kaya Skin Bars will not only be half the size of the Skin Clinics, they can be set up at half the cost as well (#30-40 lakh on average). There will be no dermatologists at the Skin Bars, which will offer limited services &mdash; whereas 75% of the Clinics&rsquo; revenue comes from services, the Bars will derive 75% of their revenues from products, for which Kaya is expanding its 36-SKU portfolio by another 18-20 in the coming few months. The management estimates that a Skin Bar should break even within three years whereas a Clinic takes four to five. &ldquo;At present, there is no plan to either shut or convert the existing Skin Clinics into Skin Bars,&rdquo; adds Pahwa. Kaya plans to open 150-200 such small-format stores over the next five years.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>"Increasing same store sales, emphasising products and offering difficult-to-duplicate, revolutionary cues will ensure Kaya''s success" - Harsh Mariwala, CMD, Marico</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">Will this MaKe a difference? Mariwala sounds confident. &ldquo;Increasing same store sales, emphasising products and offering difficult-to-duplicate, revolutionary cures&rdquo; is his recipe for Kaya&rsquo;s success. It will take more than that, warns Luthra. &ldquo;The new staff being brought in to run the business are from a non-beauty, FMCG background. What most players don&rsquo;t realise is that this business requires a high level of domain expertise and consistent investment in R&amp;D, technology absorption and training. Moreover, by launching Skin Bars, Kaya will compete with product specialist companies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brands like Biotique have found out the hard way that products-only stores don&rsquo;t always work out &mdash; the high-end beauty products brand has scaled down its exclusive outlets and now focuses on multi-brand retail outlets. Vanity and the need to look good will always be popular, but whether Kaya&rsquo;s makeover will make money from serving that need, remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p>', 'Marico has spun-off its bleeding skincare business.

(263, 16, '', 'Different strokes', '<p class="p1">What comes to your mind when you hear names like VeeDee, Black Elemente, Zinglife, Swipe, Ice Xtreme, Kobian and Redd? Deodorants, maybe? Apparel brands or pubs? How about, none of the above? These are just some of the over 135 brands of tablet computers that have flooded the Indian market in the past year or so. Almost all the big brands &mdash; Apple, Samsung, Asus, Sony, Dell, BlackBerry <em>et</em> <em>al</em> &mdash; are already present in the country but, while they have their fans and aspirational value, apparently it&rsquo;s the Xelectronics and Zyncs that are flying off the shelves. According to data from CyberMedia Research, over 63% of all tablets sold in India cost under Rs 10,000. And boy, are they selling &mdash; 2012 sales are likely to have crossed 3 million, up six times from 500,000 in 2011; the research firm&rsquo;s forecast for 2013: at least 6 million.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Granted, that&rsquo;s growth on a tiny base and is still nowhere close to the numbers seen in the US or even China. Recent reports predict that, with sales of over 65 million units, China will account for 27% of the global tablet market in 2013, while North America will continue to be the largest market, accounting for 85 million units. There&rsquo;s also the inevitable, if unfair, comparison with mobile phones: during the July-September 2012 quarter, some 1.1 million tablets were sold across India; the same period saw sales of around 50 million handsets, of which nearly 4 million were smartphones (priced at around Rs 15,000).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But look at it this way: mobile phones have been around for nearly two decades; there&rsquo;s a subscriber base of more than 900 million and several consumers have multiple handsets. On the other hand, broadband and 3G connectivity in India, essential for tablets, is still very patchy. Which begs the question: can India leapfrog its way in tablets and repeat the kind of explosive growth that it witnessed in mobile phones? If yes, is there anything that can hold it back?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>The cost factor</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">A June 2012 report by McKinsey &amp; Co lists affordability as the first requirement for driving tablet growth worldwide. From the looks of it, Indian tablet brands have already got that covered. Of the 137 brands currently in the market, nearly 90 are in the sub-Rs 5,000 segment and about 35 cost between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000, according to industry estimates. Where the iPad3 32 GB retails at Rs 38,000 and the smaller Google Nexus 7 (considered the best in class among Android tablets) is available at close to Rs 20,000, also available are 7-inch, wi-fi enabled tablets for as little as Rs 2,999. That includes little-known brands such as Sylvania, Vox and Zync.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Certainly, cheaper tablets have the potential to open up the market to a whole new customer group &mdash; lower income households, those reluctant to invest in a personal computer or notebook, and those who will leapfrog to the latest technology. But how are they able to keep prices so low? &ldquo;There is an increasing number of low-end devices being launched by OEMs, enabled by both hardware commoditisation driven by China and Taiwan-based suppliers, and OS availability [most of these devices run on Google&rsquo;s open operating system, Android],&rdquo; explains Jayantha Kolla, partner at tech consultancy Convergence Catalyst. That&rsquo;s not all, says Suneet Tuli, founder of Datawind, the British company that&rsquo;s making the Aakash 2 tablet for the Indian government (a non-subsidised version is marketed under the Ubislate brand). He says that the LCD touch panel accounts for as much as half the manufacturing cost of the tablet; to keep a lid on that, Datawind has its own LCD touch panel plants, one in Montreal with a second one coming up in Hyderabad. The design of the tablet also plays a crucial role in keeping prices low. The Aakash 2 printed circuit board integrates components and costs Datawind under Rs 900, compared with more than Rs 1,500 for rivals. The devices are also assembled in Amritsar, saving on labour costs. &ldquo;We have our own IP on the screens. And, we have a disruptive distribution model,&rdquo; Tuli adds. Simply put, that means Datawind sells its products only online, doing away with a distribution network where it would have to share revenue. &ldquo;That removes a lot of people from the chain, resulting in obvious savings.&rdquo; And taking a cue from Google, the company also sells ad space on pre-loaded apps on the Ubislate, where it splits the revenue with app developers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Datawind&rsquo;s <em>desi</em> counterpart, Micromax &mdash; it&rsquo;s currently the No.2 tablet maker in the country behind Samsung, with a 15.3% marketshare in Q3FY13 <em>(see: First mover advantage)</em> &mdash; has a slightly different strategy to keep prices low. The company has five models in the market, with the cheapest costing less than Rs 5,000, if bought online. Essentially, contract manufacturing in China and a wide, pan-India distribution network are helping the company achieve volumes. Adds Deepak Mehrotra, CEO, Micromax, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t over-design our products. Features are added keeping customer usage and preference in mind.&rdquo; The Funbook Alpha is targeted at students and comes loaded with educational apps and games, while the Funbook Infinity is primarily an entertainment device and, hence, has loud speakers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Obviously, then, manufacturers are working overtime to differentiate themselves. But who&rsquo;s buying these tablets? While Datawind&rsquo;s biggest customer is the Indian government, which has placed orders for 100,000 units of Aakash 2, the company has orders for 4 million pieces for the Ubislate, mostly from first-time computer users. &ldquo;Consumption is bound to go up as there are so many people in India keen to get connected, but they don&rsquo;t have a device,&rdquo; adds Tuli.</p>\n<p class="p3">The McKinsey report also estimates that new, less affluent customer segments &ldquo;will fuel around 60% of the total cumulative sales through 2016&rdquo;. It may be a while, though, before older customers and those from smaller towns and non-urban geographies in India take to the new technology as enthusiastically as they have accepted mobile telephony. For the time being, tablet sales are ticking all predictable boxes &mdash; younger consumers are early adopters of this relatively new technology and the maximum demand for tablets is coming from metros. Mehrotra says large format stores and experience retail outlets where consumers can touch and feel the devices are the biggest sales channels. &ldquo;Currently, online accounts for 8-9% of our sales, while IT and mobile retail channels are seeing fast growth,&rdquo; he says. But like Tuli, he recognises the importance of selling through the net. &ldquo;One of my earliest orders for a tab, in April 2012, came from a customer in the North East. And it came online,&rdquo; Mehrotra points out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Marketing upfront</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Still, most tablet makers seem to be focusing their marketing activities across three main planks &mdash; entertainment, education and enterprise &mdash; which they hope will cut across age and income categories. Samsung Mobile vice-president Asim Warsi says that his company has a &ldquo;fairly clear enterprise focus&rdquo; and within it, a key segment it is pursuing is education. Samsung is currently the leader in the tablets market, with a 24% marketshare for its three models, which are priced at the higher end of the market, ranging from Rs 21,000 to Rs 40,000. What make them popular in the enterprise and education segment, Warsi explains, are relevant apps. Samsung is also working with the government &mdash; Samsung tabs used by members of Parliament are loaded with apps that enable MPs to see details of the various sessions, starred questions for the day, parliamentary bulletins and other information. He adds that the tabs are being used by enterprises for sales force automation, which allows the head office to keep track of work being done by the sales team on a real-time basis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Another company that&rsquo;s turned to the enterprise segment to push tablet sales is BlackBerry (earlier Research in Motion). When the company slashed prices on its Playbook tablets by nearly half in a special year-end offer in winter 2011, sales zoomed. So much so that Sunil Lalwani, director of enterprise sales at BlackBerry India, told <em>Outlook Business</em> at the time that the company was out of stock on one Playbook model due to huge demand. Given the BlackBerry connection, the interest is understandable. Explains Amit Mathur, director, channels, for BlackBerry India, &ldquo;With the rise in bring-your-own-device as a trend, the lines between personal and professional lives are blurring and a tablet helps switch between functions effortlessly.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">The biggest push for tablet makers, though, is expected from the education segment. Several state governments &mdash; including Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa &mdash; have already made poll promises of providing high school students tablet computers, apart from the HRD ministry buying Aakash 2 in bulk for subsidised sale to school and university students. Some upscale individual schools across India, including Maharani Gayatri Devi School in Jaipur and Podar International School in Mumbai, are also offering students the option of switching from regular textbooks to iPads. Considering there are some 220 million students in India, if even a fraction of them move to tablets, we&rsquo;re talking of a market of several million. As Bharti Airtel&rsquo;s president, consumer business, K Srinivas says, these devices are a popular choice for most first-time internet users. &ldquo;Tablets, as a category, are gaining huge market traction. I believe this will play a big role in data services going mass in India,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>Experience is everything</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">With so much going for it, what&rsquo;s holding back tablets adoption in India? Essentially, user experience. How well a tab works is not only a function of its hardware and software quality; it also depends on telecom networks and the availability of apps. In India, both areas leave a lot to be desired. Mehrotra of Micromax says that growth could have been much faster but for two things &mdash; what a person can do with a device and how he can do it. The second part requires connectivity at reasonable price points. &ldquo;The existing data plans are great for usage on phones but not for tabs. If you want these devices to take off in the hinterland, you need good, high-speed pervasive networks and reasonable data tariffs,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Vishal Tripathi, principal analyst with Gartner India, says that patchy coverage, especially in 3G networks, is playing spoilsport. &ldquo;The tab requires good 3G networks or wi-fi spots. Without them, it doesn&rsquo;t offer much utility.&rdquo; Moreover, unlike for mobiles, especially smartphones, telcos haven&rsquo;t launched special data usage plans for tablets, nor are they offering bundled deals with specific devices. &ldquo;We are not tying up with vendors yet,&rdquo; confirms Anupam Sachdev, CMO, Aircel Cellular. &ldquo;The focus is more on smartphones as consumption is bigger in that segment. But certainly, tablet growth will explode as broadband networks expand over a period of time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">As of now, operators don&rsquo;t have tabs-specific plans as they believe the non-voice plans designed for dongles work for the tabs as well. Idea Cellular CMO Sashi Shankar says his company offers enough data plans for consumers to choose from. &ldquo;There is no need for separate data plans for tabs because over a period of time, there will be plans catering to two-three devices per person and tabs will be covered in that.&rdquo; Moreover, data consumption habits tend to be the same across dongles and tablets. While tabs are growing fast as a category, Idea is still evaluating the option of bundling them with connections. &ldquo;We want to market tabs at the right price and with the right features. We haven&rsquo;t got the right pricing so far,&rdquo; Shankar adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">Tablet makers are trying to work their way around the lack of 3G connectivity and high data usage charges. Brands such as Aakash, Micromax and Lemon are launching low-cost devices with embedded GPRS modems, which eliminate the need for external dongles. Trouble is, GPRS provides data speeds of just 56-114 kbps, which is inadequate for bandwidth-hungry applications such as video streaming and music file downloads.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">If that&rsquo;s not bad enough, there&rsquo;s also the question of content. While browsing the net and checking e-mail remain the most popular activities on tablets, as customers evolve, their demands from tablets will change. Right now, though, there&rsquo;s a paucity of India-specific apps. &ldquo;The cost of creating apps for tablets is 30-40% higher than for mobiles,&rdquo; explains Nitish Mittersain, CEO, Nazara Technologies, which develops apps for mobiles and tabs. &ldquo;Because tablets are more powerful devices with bigger screens, everything &mdash; the graphics, the experience etc. &mdash; has to be of console quality, which increases the cost of development of games and content.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Still, efforts are being made to provide Indian tablet buyers relevant content. Market leader Samsung, for instance, has R&amp;D centres in Bengaluru and Noida, as well as third-party developers, content aggregators and middleware partners to develop apps. &ldquo;We have some seven series of apps for India, designed primarily for tabs. Localised apps are very important for growing tablets as a category,&rdquo; says Warsi.</p>\n<p class="p3">BlackBerry, too, has devised applications that will appeal to its enterprise customers. Currently, the company has over 40,000 developers in India creating applications for the BlackBerry platform. It has also set up a lab in Kochi to focus on local app development and offerings include applications for specific fields such as healthcare. For instance, Max Healthcare has rolled out an BlackBerry solution that connects an archive of radiology images, lab reports and other patient information that doctors can access on their BlackBerrys and Playbooks at any time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Reality check</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Given all that is happening around, it&rsquo;s easy to get carried away when talking of the potential for tablets in India. The comparison with mobile phones is usually offered as an example of what&rsquo;s possible &mdash; so many millions still don&rsquo;t have landlines, but mobile penetration in India is a staggering 73%. In the West, tablets are becoming ubiquitous and are predicted to outship notebook computers this year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But that&rsquo;s not going to happen anytime soon in India. For starters, no one &mdash; not even tablet manufacturers &mdash; is yet thinking of the tablet as a replacement for the personal computer, or even the smartphone. &ldquo;Tabs are complementing devices and not a replacement by any measure,&rdquo; declares Warsi. &ldquo;Most consumers who have a tab have a phone already. We have been evangelising both categories with equal gusto.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">According to Manufacturers Association of Information Technology (Mait), tablet sales in India are expected to cross 1.6 million units in FY13, a growth of 40% over the previous year. (Incidentally, that&rsquo;s a more conservative estimate than CyberMedia Research, which considers devices with screens of over 5 inches as tablets against Mait&rsquo;s cut-off of 7 inches.) Over the same period, the PC market (desktops and notebooks) will grow 16% to cross 10.8 million units. &ldquo;Currently, the value proposition of tablets is not clearly established. It will not be a priority purchase, unlike mobiles, which address a basic, inherent need for communication,&rdquo; says Anwar Shirpurwala, executive director, Mait.</p>\n<p class="p3">As things stand, vendors are ready with a wide range of tabs, offering options in price, connectivity and screen size. Then, none of the barriers to broader usage, be it network issues, lack of apps and user experience, is significant enough to be a deal-breaker. Convergence&rsquo;s Kolla points out that one reason why the tablets app ecosystem will take time to develop in India is because currently only 8% of buyers base their decisions on the availability of appropriate apps. But, put all these issues together and it doesn&rsquo;t seem likely that the segment will witness exponential growth for a while.

(265, 20, '', 'Running out of steam', '<p class="p1">After rallying for the past couple of months and crossing the 20,000 mark, the markets seem determined for a correction. While the year-to-date fall in the Sensex is less than 1%, the stress is visible in the mid-cap and small-cap indices, which have fallen by 6-9% over the same period. Could this mean a deeper correction is yet to follow in large-caps?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Typically, a fall in the mid-cap index is an early indicator of a possible downtrend across the board. Mid-caps not only tend to beat the markets on the upside, they tend to lead the fall and that too precipitously on the way down. That&rsquo;s because mid-caps gain the most from a positive change in the economic climate and end up being the first victims of deterioration in business confidence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">This time, though, the reason for the slide in mid-caps is not entirely a reflection of the state of the economy. Over 2012, the BSE mid-cap index was up close to 40%, with most of the gains coming in the last quarter of the year. So, after the rally, a consolidation was bound to happen. Analysts feel that major investors must have shifted their funds from mid-caps and small-caps to frontline stocks after the better-than-expected results delivered by companies such as Reliance and Infosys.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Going downhill- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">While a sharp fall in mid-cap stocks could be the result of draw-down by investors to realign their portfolios in favour of large-caps, it is also attributed to revocation of pledges in many cases. As for large-caps, they are not as vulnerable to pledged shares; still, Anand Rathi&rsquo;s Sandeep Shenoy asserts that a correction in frontline indices can&rsquo;t be ruled out. &ldquo;Many of the large-caps have exhibited strong traction in earnings but they may still not be out of the woods. Hence, earning glitches could be on the cards next quarter onwards. This, on the back of rich valuations, leads us to believe that bouts of correction would be a part of our markets for some time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">That is not the unanimous view in the market, though. Jigar Shah, head of research at Kim Eng Securities, strikes an optimistic note when he says that the fall in growth in the economy and the corporate sector has bottomed out. &ldquo;Unless there is an unforeseeable event in the global markets, I don&rsquo;t see an immediate downside for the Sensex,&rdquo; he points out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Meanwhile, all eyes are on the Budget, scheduled to be tabled end-February. &ldquo;Any major corrections will depend on the Budget, but perhaps that will not come to pass because with the upcoming general elections in 2014, the government will probably avoid upsetting the market,&rdquo; says Shah. While market movement in the recent sessions point towards a decisive correction, there is no definitive view on whether corporate performance will get better or worse in the coming quarter. A sliding market ahead of the Budget means expectations from the finance minister are muted, and could set the stage for a positive surprise.

(266, 20, '', 'Estimated time of debt departure: Unclear', '<p class="p1">You would expect the company that runs two of India&rsquo;s busiest airports to be an investors&rsquo; darling. But that&rsquo;s not quite how it is for GVK Power &amp; Infrastructure. From trading around Rs 40 a couple of years ago, the company&rsquo;s stock is down to Rs 13 now. On their part, investors have had good reason to be spooked. The company has been posting a net loss since Q3FY12. For the latest quarter for which financials are available, GVK reported a net loss of Rs 43.66 crore. Adding to the company&rsquo;s woes is a gross consolidated debt of around Rs 15,000 crore which translates to an interest outgo of over Rs 700 crore every year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Certainly, the flagship power business hasn&rsquo;t been doing too well. Operational performance has been deteriorating, with a total generation of 684 million units in Q2FY13 against 1,299 million units in the previous quarter. &ldquo;The losses could continue for a few more quarters because of the shortage of gas supply for our power plants and the high interest burden,&rdquo; says a candid Isaac George, chief financial officer, GVK Power &amp; Infrastructure.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The losses could continue for a few quarters, given the shortage of gas supply and the high interest burden" - Isaac George, CFO, GVK Power and Infrastructure</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Still, there is a glimmer of hope here: the Andhra Pradesh government has agreed to allow two of GVK&rsquo;s gas-based power plants (Jegurupadu Phase 1 and 2 and Gautami), among others, to run on imported liquefied natural gas, since they&rsquo;re not getting sufficient supply from Reliance&rsquo;s KG-D6 basin. &ldquo;If this comes through, it will put us back on track,&rdquo; says George. More significant for GVK, though, is a recent positive development in its airport business.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Cash counter&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">While the airport business now brings in as much revenue as the power arm, it continues to drain cash. GVK&rsquo;s attempts to bridge its cash flow requirements received a boost when the Airport Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) decided that Mumbai International Airport (MIAL) &mdash; in which GVK has a 50.5% stake through its subsidiary GVK Airport Holdings &mdash; could continue to levy airport development fee (ADF) for another eight years. The earlier decision to discontinue the fee by January 2013 was overturned, although MIAL&rsquo;s request to increase the levy to Rs 200 for domestic passengers and Rs 1,300 for international passengers (against the current Rs 100 and Rs 600, respectively) was rejected. AERA has said that a total Rs 3,400 crore can be collected through ADF, including the Rs 750 crore already collected from passengers since 2009. The fee will help bridge the funding gap of redeveloping the airport &mdash; against an earlier estimated Rs 9,802 crore, the final cost of construction is now estimated at Rs 12,070 crore. &ldquo;This approval significantly addresses the overhang of the large funding gap that existed in financing the Mumbai airport capex,&rdquo; write IDFC analysts Shirish Rane and Ashish Shah in a report.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Dip ahead- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">There&rsquo;s more. The company&rsquo;s two-year wait to develop 200 acres of land around Mumbai airport may also soon be over. &ldquo;We are waiting for just one sign-off from the chief minister. The moment it happens, we will start work on monetisation,&rdquo; says George.</p>\n<p class="p3">About 15-20 million sq ft can be developed on the land, where use is restricted to hotels, serviced apartments, office space and retail development. The marketing rights for the project, named GVK Sky City, has been bagged by property advisory Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Some 3.5 million sq ft will be developed in the first tranche, which will start by end-CY13. &ldquo;We are waiting for permission from MMRDA and other local authorities,&rdquo; says Anuj Puri, country head, JLL India. &ldquo;The good thing GVK is doing is that it is not coming out with auctions till all the approvals are in place, which is why the process has taken a little longer. We expect that over the next two to three months, all approvals will be in place.&rdquo; Six plots totalling 15 acres will come up for auction this year &mdash; since the government through Airports Authority of India (AAI) holds 26% in MIAL, there will be a public auction. The land will be given on 30-year lease to developers with the option to extend for another 30 years &mdash; MIAL will not develop the land, but will earn revenue through lease rentals. A January 8 report by JP Morgan Equity Research &mdash; perhaps the only report that views the company positively &mdash; values the airport land at Rs 1,250 crore and has said that approval of monetisation of Mumbai airport land will be a positive. Nevertheless, other analysts remain sceptical of GVK&rsquo;s future prospects &mdash; with good reason.</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Heavy weather</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">A big overhang on the stock is GVK&rsquo;s $1.26 billion acquisition of Australia&rsquo;s Hancock Coal in 2011. &ldquo;It is a negative because nobody knows the deal contours and how exactly it is going to pan out,&rdquo; says Phillip Capital analyst Vibhor Singhal. While GVK Power holds just 10% in the project &mdash; the rest is held by GVK Coal Developers (Singapore), a subsidiary of group company GVK Natural Resources &mdash; it stands guarantee for 49% of the debt taken for making the acquisition. Analysts say this is not good governance, a charge George denies. &ldquo;It would have been bad corporate governance if we had not disclosed this structure, but we did. Besides, this is not the final structure &mdash; the promoters may collapse their holding company into GVK Power plus there is the option to increase our stake,&rdquo; he defends. Certainly, GVK Power has the option of increasing its stake in Hancock Coal to 49%, but that would mean additional equity requirement. &ldquo;It would be a very bad idea,&rdquo; cautions Singhal. &ldquo;The company already has huge debt.&rdquo; While the company is trying to reduce that &mdash; by selling stake in its airports and roads business &mdash; it hasn&rsquo;t had any success yet.</p>\n<p class="p3">In early January, the market celebrated briefly when GVK announced its exit from a road project in Madhya Pradesh. A year earlier, the company had signed a concession agreement with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for four-laning the Shivpuri-Dewas section of NH-3. The Rs 3,200-crore project was to be executed as a build-operate-transfer toll project with a 30-year concession period. But GVK backed out, citing delays in securing environmental clearances from the government &mdash; a Supreme Court ruling now makes it mandatory to get the green go-ahead even for projects involving extraction of minor minerals, and road projects use minor minerals such as boulders, fuller&rsquo;s earth, quartzite and sandstone. &ldquo;Bankers are no longer willing to fund projects that don&rsquo;t have clearances,&rdquo; points out M Murali, director general of the National Highways Builders Federation. So, when NHAI failed to get the necessary clearances, GVK sent a notice to terminate the project. The case is now being heard in the Delhi high court.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Cost of flying high- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Rahul Metkar, an analyst with MSFL Research, says the real reason for the termination must be banks&rsquo; refusal to give GVK loans on favourable terms or the company may have had problems with financial closure. &ldquo;GVK bid for this project when there was euphoria in the market. With the economy not doing well, the road sector is seeing a slowdown. This could have influenced the company&rsquo;s decision to quit the project,&rdquo; he adds. But the fallout of this decision is still not clear. Murali says if GVK loses in court, it will have to forfeit part or all of the 10% project cost it had submitted as performance guarantee. Worse, the developer could be blacklisted by NHAI for anywhere up to three or five years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Of course, there is a chance that GVK could win the case. &ldquo;Partially, NHAI is at fault because it is supposed to get clearances by the time the concession agreement is signed,&rdquo; points out Murali. If the company gets a favourable ruling it could ask NHAI to make good the investment it&rsquo;s already sunk into the terminated project. A month after signing the concession agreement, GVK hired L&amp;T Construction and KNR Construction as contractors, which, in turn, signed on some 200 people. In the year it waited for clearances, the company had already spent some Rs 300-400 crore out of its Rs 1,300-crore equity commitment. But if it does petition for recovery of funds, the case will certainly go into arbitration &mdash; NHAI already has arbitration cases worth over Rs 10,000 crore and it may be well over three years before the case is resolved.</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Guided landing</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Where the roads business is muddled in litigation, even the airports segment is not without hurdles. The Mumbai and Bengaluru airports saw traffic decline on a year-on-year basis in Q3FY13 &mdash; while passenger traffic was down 8% and 10% at these airports, cargo movement had declined 4% and 0.3%, respectively. More worrying, though, is the Rs 1,763-crore bridge loan GVK took to increase its stake and become the largest shareholders in these airports.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">GVK part-financed the stake acquisition by securitising its toll collections at subsidiary company Jaipur-Kishangarh Expressway. GVK&rsquo;s plan to refinance this debt with relatively cheaper USD funding has not materialised yet, wrote BNP Paribas analyst Vishal Sharma in his earlier report. Metkar adds, &ldquo;The additional stake acquired has not resulted in any cash flow. That is why GVK continues to rely on other project companies to pay interest on the bridge loan.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">To tide over this crunch, GVK is negotiating with a few private equity players to dilute its stake in GVK Airport Holdings. Metkar says the company is looking to raise $250-300 million equity through this, which will help it save at least Rs 80-85 crore on interest expense. George, though, thinks the saving will be much higher. &ldquo;If this deal comes through, we will save close to Rs 400 crore on a debt of Rs 3,000 crore,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We expect to raise Rs 3,000 crore, for which we may have to dilute 30-33% stake. But we are prepared to dilute even up to 49% stake, depending on the valuation.&rdquo; This is the second time GVK is seeking an investor in the airports business after Changi Airports Group backed out of investing #2,200 crore for a 26% stake in March 2012.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The latest development is an internal transfer of promoter shareholding. Stock exchange filings show that matriarch G Indira Krishna Reddy has moved about 5% of her holding to son GV Sanjay Reddy. Analysts say a possible reason is a re-jigging of responsibilities among the promoters. Given that the family is close knit, such a move could also mean that either the promoters might resort to pledging shares or better still, could be in the final stages of selling a stake to a strategic investor. GVK is openly scouting for investors, so the latter could be a likely reason. Group chairman GVK Reddy himself dismisses such a development. &ldquo;This means nothing. It&rsquo;s just an internal transfer of shares and does not imply selling or pledging of shares,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Despite lagging in the market for so long, most analysts continue to remain deeply sceptical of GVK Power. The poor performance of the gas-based power plants, muted traffic growth in the road segment and the questions around the Hancock deal has led to most analysts rating it as an &ldquo;under-performer&rdquo;. Singhal concludes, &ldquo;There are a lot of moving parts and investors don&rsquo;t like to invest where there are many moving parts.&rdquo; <span class="s2"><br /></span></p>', 'The uncertainties around its power and airport businesses have kept GVK from soaring', '30', '', 0, '', 'estimated-time-of-debt-departure-unclear-266', 261, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Estimated time of debt departure: Unclear', 'The uncertainties around its power and airport businesses have kept GVK from soaring', '', '', '', 'GVK Power & Infra,Debt', 0, NULL, '2015-01-27 18:15:32', '2015-01-27 18:44:52', '2013-03-02', 0),

Two years ago, he and his son cheered themselves hoarse at a hugely exciting and rare event series just three days apart &mdash; the two La Liga classic face-offs between Real Madrid and Barcelona, the first in Madrid, followed by the drive down to Valencia for the final. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get better than that &mdash; 15 of those 22 players belong to world-leading teams,&rdquo; Chaturvedi says with boyish enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Before Spain, it was Chelsea versus Manchester United in London, which Chelsea won 2-1. It was an incredible experience for his 12-year-old son, Chaturvedi says, to watch his favourite team win on its home turf. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how magnificent it is at Madrid &mdash; the passion, the rivalry, the quality of the game, the football culture, the rituals big and small. People bring sunflower seeds in bags, break and eat them at the match.&rdquo; It was a posting in Hong Kong and a lively &lsquo;soccer culture&rsquo; in his son&rsquo;s school that sharpened Chaturvedi&rsquo;s hunger for the great game. They missed the World Cup in SA but this May, the schedule&rsquo;s been cleared for the Champions League Final &mdash; again in Madrid. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Sport and work spill into each other effortlessly in the 44-year-old Chaturvedi&rsquo;s life. He first started out about 12-odd years ago looking at TRPs of games like the English Premier League that his brand sponsored &mdash; and strategy became passion. &ldquo;Once I started watching the game seriously, it was impossible not to get drawn into soccer.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Naturally, soccer translates as inspiring pep talk at company presentations since, &ldquo;Soccer is also about team spirit and isn&rsquo;t that what work is about?&rdquo; Another example he likes to give is that of the Real Madrid manager, Jose Mourinho, who is, &ldquo;highly talented no doubt, but his ego becomes bigger than the team. We should nurture talent instead.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Chaturvedi&rsquo;s most cherished memory is the T-shirt every member of the Real Madrid team, including Cristiano Ronaldo and Ricardo Carvalho, signed and gave his son as a birthday present two years ago &mdash; which he has worn for every birthday since. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll frame it when he outgrows it,&rdquo; says Chaturvedi with childlike glee. &ldquo;A wall in our home has been left blank for it.&rdquo;</p>', 'Tommy Hilfiger''s Shailesh Chaturvedi is a soccer fan who crosses continents to watch his favourite teams in action', '34', '', 0, '', 'all-the-world-is-a-game-268', 263, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'All the world is a game', 'Tommy Hilfiger''s Shailesh Chaturvedi is a soccer fan who crosses continents to watch his favourite teams in action', '', '', '', 'Shailesh Chaturvedi,Tommy Hilfiger,Soccer,Real Madrid', 0, NULL, '2015-01-27 18:55:36', '2015-01-27 18:57:56', '2013-03-02', 0),

They&rsquo;re not getting away with it, though &mdash; that precious napkin also has drawings by his wife Maite Delteil and daughter Maya Burman, both acknowledged as artists to watch out for (and collect) in their native France as much as in India. (A signature by actor Katrina Kaif will make that napkin more precious &mdash; but about that, more later.)</p>\n<p class="p3">Sakti Burman, &ldquo;head&rdquo; of the clan, began his career in Calcutta, and though he has enjoyed heady success in India in, particularly, the last decade, he built an enviable reputation for himself in Paris, where his fine art prints at the start of his career were exhibited alongside those by Pablo Picasso and Marc Chagall. However, it was his &ldquo;marbling&rdquo; style, mixing water with oil to create a mosaic-like background reminiscent of the ancient frescos in Italy, that made him stand out. That and his ability to create enchanted gardens where figures of friends, family, gods and goddesses and mythological beings&nbsp; result in idylls almost of paradise.</p>\n<p class="p3">His wife, Maite Delteil, dwells in a somewhat similar idyllscape, but there is no magic realism at play here. Instead, she captures everyday scenes, often around beautiful gardens with flowers, trees and birds, where lovers or families abound. The approach has a Western formalism, but it is also playful, an element their daughter Maya Burman has seized upon. &ldquo;She had been far more influenced by her father earlier,&rdquo; shares an analyst, &ldquo;but in recent times, she appears to be drawn to her mother&rsquo;s use of primary colours.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">If anyone is adhering closest to the path set by Sakti, it is his niece Jayasri Burman &mdash; even though from medium to style to subjects (entirely based around Indian mythology), hers appears to be a departure. Instead of being placed randomly, her figures occupy the centre stage. But in creating something that is fantastic &mdash; swans emerging from a goddess-like figure&rsquo;s hair &mdash; she is more akin to her uncle&rsquo;s work than that of her husband, the maverick Paresh Maity, who is primarily a colourist (shades of Maite) and arguably India&rsquo;s greatest watercolourist. That he visited Sakti Burman&rsquo;s studio in Paris during his first European outing and long before he knew Jayasri merely intertwines their fascinating careers together.</p>\n<p class="p3">Paresh began his career making watercolours &mdash; a medium that continues to fascinate him, and to which he returns intermittently &mdash; but it is his canvases with their primary colours and portraits (and occasionally landscapes) that continue to be his biggest market. While Jayasri has in recent years experimented with sculptures, Paresh has been there, done that, and moved on to working more in the installation space. Both have a growing number of dedicated collectors all over India, part of the West as well as in South-east Asia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">They move seamlessly to create works in which one artist&rsquo;s magically drawn figures join effortlessly with the others&rsquo; &mdash; creating such a tapestry on a napkin on a dinner table on one such outing in Mumbai.

(272, 12, '', 'Recreating the magic', '<p class="p1"><span class="s1">T</span>he resurgence of Indian comic books is best understood through Vivek Goel&rsquo;s experimentative journey. The 31-year-old founder of Holy Cow Entertainment worked for 14 years as an artist for various comic book brands before deciding to launch his own label with a bunch of illustrators, writers and colourists in May 2011. &ldquo;Our industry is full of flaws and no one respects independent ideas,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">How independent? Well, for one, Holy Cow&rsquo;s first offering <em>Ravanayan</em> retold the classic mythological tale from the point of view of its &lsquo;evil&rsquo; character Ravana, instead of Ram. Its <em>Aghori</em> series is about a city dweller, who while searching for his missing son, enters the world of Aghorisadhus (believed to indulge in cannibalistic rituals), takes up their powers, and encounters the supernatural. These are serious, often dark, subjects that aim for an adult audience, and a pretty niche one at that. With nine titles out in about 19 months, Goel claims to have sold over 5,000 copies per title and could break even by June 2013.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Like those of his contemporaries, Goel&rsquo;s success may be surprising but it&rsquo;s no fluke. Built around evolved tastes and a maturing audience, this is the emerging face of a business that was once nearly wiped out by cable television and video games. New, independent comic labels such as Vimanika, Campfire and Holy Cow run with small teams and tight budgets, publish only in English and sell online, to overseas as well as Indian readers. In that sense they complement the second coming of traditional children&rsquo;s comic book brands such as Amar Chitra Katha (ACK), Diamond Comics and Raj Comics, while steering clear from their territory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Reading Up</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">&ldquo;Different art forms are being explored and the audience base is broadening,&rdquo; agrees Manas Mohan, chief operating officer, ACK Media, citing a 30% growth in readership in the past two years. At Delhi-based Raj Comics, too, things are looking up. &ldquo;We are doing roughly 60-80,000 copies per issue in print today,&rdquo; says founder Manish Gupta. Its hugely popular character Nagraj, introduced in 1984, sold up to 500,000 copies per issue during its peak according to Gupta, before dropping to 30,000 copies in 2000-01.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The business of comic books is estimated at Rs 100 crore today. Yet, folks like Jatin Varma are confident of exciting times ahead. The 27-year-old Varma runs Twenty Onwards Media, an &lsquo;alternative media house&rsquo; that produces TV shows, a humour magazine and comic books, among other things. Among them is <em>Random</em>, a monthly humour magazine with irreverently named characters like Ud Bilaw Manus(UBiMa), Col. Chikara, Kiraaye Ke Tattuand Slutty Savitri, who speak a language laced with Bhojpuri overtones. Varma is better known, however, as the person who started India&rsquo;s first comic book convention &mdash; Comic Con &mdash; staged across Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">An annual affair now, ComicCon hosted its third edition at Dilli Haat in India&rsquo;s capital recently. Around 50,000 people &mdash; publishers, artists and fans &mdash; flocked to this three-day gathering where comics, graphic novels and merchandise worth Rs 1 crore were reportedly sold. &ldquo;It gives comic book makers, especially new and smaller ones who don&rsquo;t have a strong distribution network, a platform to reach customers,&rdquo; says Varma, who plans to take it to other cities and increase global participation. Goel couldn&rsquo;t agree more: &ldquo;We went with three boxes full of comics and by the third afternoon, we had nothing left to sell,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We went with three boxes full of comics [to the Comic Con] and by the third afternoon, we had nothing left to sell" - Vivek Goel, founder, Holy Cow Entertainment</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Among the formats that Comic Con has helped popularise is the graphic novel &mdash; essentially a longer version of the comic book that tells a single story. Campfire Graphic Novels is a key player in this category. Its promoter Keshav Thirani has engineering units in Noida that make railway equipment and LED lighting, clocking hundreds of crores every year. &ldquo;Today there is lack of reading (among young children) due to distractions,&rdquo; he says. Campfire Graphic Novels launched in 2008, and revenues touched Rs 50 lakh in the first year alone. This year, Thirani is gunning for Rs 1 crore in sales. At Rs 195 a copy, Campfire&rsquo;s graphic novels on Steve Jobs, Lord Krishna, Mother Teresa and Nelson Mandela find more takers abroad than at home. &ldquo;40% of our revenue comes from the US and 25% from the UK,&rdquo; says Thirani, who has roped in professionals like Jason Quinn, a former writer with Marvel Comics in the UK.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Comic Con gives comic book makers, who don''t have a strong distribution network, a platform to reach customers" - Jatin Varma, founder, Twenty Onwards Media</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Labels like Holy Cow depend almost entirely on online channels for sales. &ldquo;We sell only through Flipkart, Readwhere and in comic conventions,&rdquo; says Goel. Varma explains that while there are enough potential readers for new age comic books and graphic novels, few magazine and book retailers are interested in stocking them. &ldquo;They charge 50% margin and don&rsquo;t take responsibility for damaged and unsold copies,&rdquo; rues Thirani. Fortunately, there&rsquo;s enough demand for non-fiction graphic novels elsewhere. ICFAI University recently bought hundreds of copies of Campfire&rsquo;s graphic novel on Steve Jobs for its graduate and post-graduate students.</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Old order, New Designs</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">For Gulshan Rai, who launched Diamond Comics in 1972, distribution is hardly an issue. At 62, Rai is a veteran of the industry, much like Anant &lsquo;Uncle&rsquo; Pai, the iconic creator-founder of ACK who passed away in February 2011. &ldquo;Even today, I sell 800,000-900,000 comics per month,&rdquo; he claims. These are published in Hindi, Bengali, and English. Rai banks mainly on reprints from Diamond&rsquo;s vast library of 5,000 titles, a network of 1,000 distributors and retailers, and continued demand for children&rsquo;s comic books from tier 2 and tier 3, Hindi-speaking markets to generate Rs 10 crore in annual revenues. &ldquo;Creating a comic book is no big deal. Selling it and recovering money is,&rdquo; says Rai. &ldquo;You can buy Diamond Comics at all railway stations, bus stations and newspaper vendors, even in smaller cities.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Creating a comic book is no big deal. Selling it and recovering the money invested is" - Gulshan Rai, founder, Diamond Comics</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Comic book makers aren&rsquo;t really worried about competing media like television, cinema, the internet, and smartphones anymore &mdash; they, in fact, want to leverage these to move ahead. &ldquo;In large cities, comics will sell more over the internet whereas in B and C towns, the physical distribution will continue to dominate,&rdquo; says ACK&rsquo;s Mohan. Comic book makers are, therefore, reaching out to new and different reader segments on various platforms. &ldquo;We plan to take all our stories on to the digital medium. We&rsquo;ll be launching about 250 titles on iOS, Android and Windows 8 mobile platforms this summer,&rdquo; says Mohan, adding that revenues from online and digital now account for 10% of ACK Media&rsquo;s revenues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"In large cities, comics will sell more over the internet whereas in B and C towns, the physical distribution will continue to dominate" - Manas Mohan, COO, ACK Media</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Print will probably remain where it is, and online will overtake it in the years to come,&rdquo; feels Gupta, who&rsquo;s bullish on rising tablet and smartphone user numbers. Raj Comics set up a comics portal on Airtel Live where users with GPRS could purchase its titles. Gupta says he is now doing the same with Tata Indicom. Raj Comics still depends on physical copy sales in north India and does not carry any advertisements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Diamond Comics has been working to adapt comic books for smartphones and PCs. &ldquo;We have agreements with 40 companies for digital delivery of comics,&rdquo; says Rai. These include Micromax, Lava and Idea. &ldquo;A speaking comic [video clip with pictures and voice over] is available for Rs 5 on mobile and we deliver an e-comic that lasts 45 days on your computer for Rs 20, against a print copy price of Rs 50,&rdquo; says Rai. It&rsquo;s not just in the delivery. Gupta plans to introduce a rebellious Nagraj in a high-school setting, &ldquo;to make him more contemporary and acceptable&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Some are going the TV way. &ldquo;Last year we released <em>Sons of Ram</em> and this year our TV serial <em>Suppandi Suppandi</em> is being aired on Cartoon Network,&rdquo; says Mohan. Anurag Kashyap plans to make a movie on <em>Doga</em>, another Raj comic superhero, and the script has been finalised. Varma says he looks forward to the Doga movie. &ldquo;It might kickstart an unlocking of potential of the comic industry in India.&rdquo; Games based on comic book characters are another route to milk the value of popular characters. But that&rsquo;s still some time away. &ldquo;Indian comic characters are not well known and new kids will not recognise old ACK characters. The reverse may happen, though. Angry Birds has become popular and is followed by merchandise and books on it,&rdquo; says Alok Kejriwal, founder, Games2Win.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>All in a name</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Building a popular character, therefore, becomes all-too important in this business. Rajesh Kamat, CEO, CA Media, invested recently in Graphic India, a comic and character company founded by Sharad Devrajan, Gotham Chopra and Suresh Seetharaman &mdash; the founders of Liquid comics in the US and India. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t look at it as a book or comic venture investment. Rather, it&rsquo;s a character entertainment space for us. Successful characters can generate huge franchisees. So, we are investing in Graphic India as an investment in a character company,&rdquo; he says. Graphic Media is coming up with Chakraa &mdash; the invisible superhero &mdash; developed by Stan Lee, the creator of Superman. This will be an animated TV series or a movie, adds Kamat. The power of strong characters is something Rai understood a long time ago. Over the years, he picked up the rights for regional characters from various publications in the North &mdash; Chacha Chaudharyin <em>Lot-Pot</em>, Billuin <em>Parag</em>, Motu-Patlu in <em>Diwana Tez </em>and Vikram-Betal in <em>Chandamama</em>. &ldquo;Today we have 40 live characters,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">These characters bring in the advertising for Diamond Comics, some of which is cleverly integrated into the storyline. For instance, one story has Sabu walking on the roof of a newly-built house and it collapses. Chacha Chaudhary advises the owner to use ACC cement the next time. Another one talks about intellectual property laws, while one has a message on SBI&rsquo;s mobile banking. &ldquo;Real Juice had taken 5 million [in 1999] from us when they launched; Sunfeast biscuits took 45 million mini-comics in 2003 during launch; and we distributed 4 million units of Big Babol with our comics when it was launched,&rdquo; recalls a proud Rai as he rattles off names of top Indian consumer brands that have advertised in his comic books. &ldquo;Parle has been advertising on our back cover for 35 years,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Producing a comic book doesn&rsquo;t come cheap. &ldquo;One page costs Rs 10,000 for writing and artwork. Then there are printing, paper, and distribution costs. A 32-page comic book can cost around Rs 3-4 lakh to create,&rdquo; says Gupta.

(273, 12, '', 'Bare bones luxury', '<p class="p1">In 19th-century south India, George Brunton&rsquo;s business was a well recognised landmark in Fort Cochin. The Dutch shipbuilder ran his business from a sprawling colonial-style building with its characteristic lime-washed walls, sloping tiled roof and terracotta floor. As the decades passed, the business faded and then died out, with the empty shell of the building a mute witness. Cut to the present. Brunton Boatyard has been rebuilt, complete with central courtyard, two-feet thick walls and enormous, wooden doorways. But it&rsquo;s no longer a godown or a commercial building &mdash; instead, it&rsquo;s a luxury hotel where four poster beds and little stools to climb into them dominate every room, and all windows open to breathtaking views of the sea. The brief to the architect in 1998 was to reproduce the original design and use materials in keeping with the original construction. The result is a property that&rsquo;s got rave reviews from travel magazines and where rooms are booked months in advance. &ldquo;But we paid a heavy price for this &mdash; the layout allows us just 26 rooms on a 1.5-acre property,&rdquo; says Jose Dominic wryly. The chairman and managing director of the Kochi-based CGH Earth isn&rsquo;t really complaining &mdash; most of his company&rsquo;s 13 properties have just about 30 rooms; there&rsquo;s even one that has room for only a single guest.</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s what sets CGH apart from other luxury boutique hotels &mdash; it&rsquo;s growing through innovative formats. Nearly six decades after it started with a single restaurant on Willingdon Island catering to sailors and dock workers, the 421-room chain has positioned itself firmly in the eco-luxury and heritage tourism space. In 2003, the group changed its name from Casino to CGH Earth to emphasise its green bent &mdash; CGH stands for clean, green and healthy. Now, it has ambitions of venturing into the north and Himalayan regions and even overseas. Can CGH&rsquo;s formula be replicated on a larger scale?</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Going green</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The Casino group was the brainchild of Dominic&rsquo;s father, who started the restaurant and then expanded in 1967 with a capital of Rs 6.5 lakh to a 32-room hotel. A chartered accountant by training, Dominic was a reluctant recruit in the hotel business, joining it a decade later. &ldquo;Initially, I thought I would help in the business till my brothers were older. But life never follows the straight and narrow path,&rdquo; he muses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The original Casino hotel in Kochi was a regular, if upscale offering. The turning point came in 1988 when the government decided to privatise Bangaram Island Resort in the Lakshadweep Islands after then-prime minister Rajiv Gandhi holidayed there. Most competing hotels suggested aggressive investments of Rs 15-16 crore with timelines running into months, if not years. &ldquo;We said we intend to remove the sprucing-up done for the PM&rsquo;s visit and put coconut thatch roofs on the cottages to return the resort to a pristine state in keeping with the surroundings,&rdquo; says Dominic. Casino won the contract in October 1988, undertaking to commission it by December. The Bangaram Island luxury resort stood out for all it <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> offer: no air-conditioning, room service, hot water, phones, swimming pool or multi-cuisine restaurants; even the employees were local fishermen who were trained to serve in the hotel. The staunchly no-frills accommodation notwithstanding, Bangaram charged premium rates &mdash; $180 a night &mdash; and it was an instant hit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>One of a kind- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">That set the tone for future projects. Casino extended the responsible tourism experiment to its upcoming properties, Spice Village at Thekkady, Coconut Lagoon at Kumarakom and Kalari Kovilakom in Palakkad (all in Kerala). The emphasis everywhere was on back-to-nature buildings and furnishings, traditional pursuits such as ayurvedic treatments and local cuisine &mdash; all at luxury prices, of course. Over the years, the focus on minimalist amenities has remained unchanged, and the company&rsquo;s earned renown not just for putting Kerala on the international tourism map but also for its unique concepts in properties <em>(see: One of a kind)</em>. &ldquo;Luxury is not about ostentation but rather the experience of a truly memorable vacation. Spice Village proved me right &mdash; customers are willing to shell out Rs 10,000 a night for a room without a TV or AC,&rdquo; says Dominic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Luxury is not about ostentation but rather the experience of a truly memorable vacation" - Jose Dominic, CMD, CGH Earth</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Actually, they&rsquo;re paying much more. A guest at Chittoor Kottaram, for instance, would spend around Rs 25,000 a night while the tab at Brunton Boatyard would be upward of Rs 30,000. Dominic declines to share revenue figures but back of the envelope calculations suggest that at an average rack rate of Rs 13,600 a night and occupancy rates of 85% in the October-March peak season (50% between April and September), CGH Earth is earning in the region of Rs 140 crore every year. If its expansion goes as planned, that figure is likely to go up significantly in the coming years.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Due north</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">In the next five years, CGH plans to open properties across India and overseas. It has already acquired properties at Venad in north Kerala, and Thanjavur and Rameshwaram in coastal Tamil Nadu. In Karnataka, the company has signed a memorandum of understanding with the state government to build hotels at Hampi, Biddar and Kalarickal. One 30-room and four 15-room hotels are planned here at a total cost of Rs 28 crore and the project is expected to be completed by early 2015. Negotiations are also on for acquiring property in the Andamans, while areas for potential hotels have been identified in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Assam, Sikkim and the Himalayan states. Next on the agenda is partnerships with hotel chains in the Saarc region and even South American countries such as Costa Rica and Belize. &ldquo;We are not looking at competing with bigger, more established players but at creating a niche space for ourselves. Our business model is sound enough to see us through,&rdquo; points out Dominic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Certainly, the market for boutique eco-friendly hotels in India is growing rapidly. Kaushik Vardharajan, MD, consulting and valuation services, HVS India, points out this is the fastest-growing segment in hospitality services &mdash; 15% a year compared with 8-10% for regular hotels. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a smaller business and there is scope for expansion. Since these hotels are usually located in exotic, non-regular locations, they make for attractive holidays,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">But it doesn&rsquo;t come cheap, or easy. &ldquo;The initial capex for eco-friendly hotels is very high &mdash; about 30% higher than a regular hotel,&rdquo; points out Paul P John, founder and CMD of The Paul Group, a 138-room luxury boutique hotel chain in Kerala and Karnataka. &ldquo;Technology has not evolved enough to offer cheap green products and maintenance costs, too, are significantly steeper initially,&rdquo; he adds. For instance, solar power for a 30-room resort would cost around Rs 30 lakh; eco-friendly LED lighting is about three times more expensive than regular, CFL options. Setting up a biogas plant means investing Rs 5 lakh (LPG would be cheaper at Rs 24,000 a month).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The initial capex for eco-friendly hotels is very high &mdash; about 30% higher than a regular hotel" - Paul P John, founder and CMD, The Paul Group</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Vardharajan points to some more hurdles: these hotels are typically smaller than regular hotels, so they tend to price their offerings higher. Then, getting licences and permits for setting up properties can be arduous since such properties are usually in ecologically sensitive areas far away from cities. &ldquo;Funding is also a constraint since these groups don&rsquo;t enjoy the brand equity of a Taj or an ITC,&rdquo; he points out.</p>\n<p class="p3">Dominic is all too aware of that. And he&rsquo;s planned accordingly. Over the coming years, CGH will transition from being a completely family-owned enterprise to a public limited company. Right now, though, it is seeking a private equity investor to pump in capital in &ldquo;tranches of Rs 500 crore&rdquo;. Media reports say that CGH is negotiating with Warburg Pincus. Dominic declines to confirm the report, only saying that the partner is yet to be finalised and the process could take another six to eight months. &ldquo;We will also leverage ourselves,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;For every Rs 500 crore raised through equity, we will raise an equal amount of debt.&rdquo; At present, CGH has a total debt of around Rs 30 crore.</p>\n<p class="p3">On average, a new resort will cost CGH around Rs 50-60 lakh a room, excluding the cost of land &mdash; which, as it happens, isn&rsquo;t as high since most properties are located in rural areas. Cash break-even takes about two years and financial break-even, four. &ldquo;Interest costs are our biggest expenditure,&rdquo; says Dominic. Despite that, the company refuses to become a venue for conferences and meets, although that&rsquo;s a lucrative option, especially during the lean months. &ldquo;We want to keep the holiday ambience intact,&rdquo; he points out.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"CGH has mastered the art of remaining real to the local flavour, thus keeping decor investments low" - Kaushik Vardharajan, MD, consulting and valuation services, HVS India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">If it gets the funding tied up, CGH&rsquo;s plans to expand should work out well. John points out that a huge advantage is that foreign travellers are increasingly more conscious and demanding of eco-friendly practices. &ldquo;Going green makes a lot of sense as a marketing strategy,&rdquo; he says. Adds Vardharajan: &ldquo;CGH has mastered the art of remaining real to the local flavour, thus keeping investments in decor and furnishings low.&rdquo; And delighting guests. Dominic recounts how a stockbroker from New York on his visit to Coconut Lagoon was appalled to find the lawns overrun with Vechoor cows, a rare breed the group is working to save. By the end of his stay, he was smitten with the creatures and wrote to Dominic on his return, asking &ldquo;Has Parvati&rsquo;s calf been born yet?&rdquo; People like him will be the best advertisement for CGH as it grows out of Kerala. &nbsp;</p>', 'CGH Earth''s USP is its innovative properties.

(274, 16, '', 'All lathered up', '<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s the latest marketing slugfest. When Reckitt Benckiser stepped into the dishwashing liquid market last month with the launch of Dettol Kitchen, it was with a bang. TV commercials openly compared the product with market leader Vim, claiming the newcomer is 100 times more effective in killing germs. Hindustan Unilever, which owns the Vim brand, reacted predictably &mdash; it first moved the Kolkata high court, which ordered removal of those portions of the ad film that show Vim. Then, HUL struck back with full-page print ads, asking users to choose between a &lsquo;harsh antiseptic&rsquo; and the &lsquo;power of 100 lemons&rsquo; when it came to cleaning their child&rsquo;s tiffin box. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Ad and marketing wars between big brands are all too common, whether it&rsquo;s for cola, shampoo or detergent. But those are huge categories where the stakes are exceptionally high. Dishwashing liquid, by contrast, seems so insignifcant. Is it really worth getting all lathered up over dirty dishes? Industry observers certainly think so. It&rsquo;s a market estimated at Rs 300 crore, growing at 40% a year. &ldquo;The increasing dearth of domestic help makes this segment promising for the launch of relatively premium products. There are low entry barriers and any FMCG company with some product differentiation stands a chance,&rdquo; says Anand Ramanathan, associate director at KPMG.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">For Reckitt, then, it was a natural progression from the personal care segment into home care and, at the same time, extend its brand positioning to the new products. &ldquo;The kitchen is a germ hotspot. It made complete sense to extend Dettol&rsquo;s germ protection promise to the kitchen,&rdquo; agrees Chander Mohan Sethi, senior VP, South East Asia, Reckitt Benckiser.</p>\n<p class="p3">But how will knocking copy &mdash; as such openly comparative advertising is called in the parlance &mdash; play out? &ldquo;All advertising is fundamentally comparative,&rdquo; says Kiran Khalap, co-founder of brand consultancy Chlorophyll. &ldquo;For many years Surf compared itself with Nirma in ads, albeit without taking names, and succeeded in convincing users.&rdquo; He adds that this is a common practice for new brands to position themselves at par with established products. Sethi&rsquo;s comment: &ldquo;Our campaign is based on scientific study and is aimed at creating consumer awareness.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">The fight between Dettol Kitchen and Vim will be a relatively equal one: Reckitt has a wide distribution reach and its inaugural pricing is similar to Vim&rsquo;s. A Delhi-based cleaning products contract manufacturer says market leadership is a function of marketing muscle and ad spend, not product virtues. &ldquo;Both are detergents. Add disinfectant and it becomes Dettol; add lemon and you get Vim. It&rsquo;s not rocket science,&rdquo; he adds dismissively. Well, the cola war, too, is fought over what is essentially sweetened water, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it any less interesting.&nbsp;</p>', 'Newcomer Dettol''s opted for an open battle with Vim in the dishwashing liquid market', '9', '', 0, '', 'all-lathered-up-274', 269, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'All lathered up', 'Newcomer Dettol''s opted for an open battle with Vim in the dishwashing liquid market', '', '', '', 'Reckitt Benckiser,Dettol,Hindustan Unilever,Vim', 0, NULL, '2015-01-28 12:14:01', '2015-01-28 12:18:06', '2013-03-30', 0),
(275, 16, '', 'The real picture', '<p class="p1">When PVR Cinemas signed up with the Prestige Forum mall in Bangalore in 2000 for an 11-screen, 2,000-seat multiplex &mdash; the first ever in India &mdash; most people in the business agreed that it was a terrible idea. &ldquo;We got a lot of flak from the industry. Everyone thought it was going to be a disaster. They asked us where we were going to get so much content from,&rdquo; recounts Pramod Arora, president and CEO, PVR Cinemas. &ldquo;But we were sure it would work. For one, people spoke nearly four or five languages in Bangalore. Even otherwise, in a country where movies are religion, we were certain if we got the execution right, we couldn&rsquo;t go wrong.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The company was able to prove its naysayers wrong in FY04, when it generated the highest seat utilisation the operators had till then, recording 2.6 million admissions in the complex.</p>\n<p class="p3">Thirteen years later, PVR is the most profitable player in the business today. In sharp contrast, Reliance Mediaworks has been struggling with huge losses (Rs 903 crore in FY12) and Inox Leisure was also in the red (Rs 1.51 crore) as interest and one-time service tax on lease rentals of previous years ate into its profitability in FY12.</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s odd in a country where stars are treated with an almost God-like reverence, and over 3 billion movie tickets are sold every year. In fact, there was a time when it seemed little could go wrong with the multiplex industry. Between 2005 and 2008, existing and new players lined up exuberant expansion targets thanks to a five-year tax holiday, in turn propelling lease rentals upwards. &ldquo;Rentals reached Rs 100-125 per sq ft per month &mdash; more than 2.5 times what the business could sustain,&rdquo; says Arora. That did nothing to quell the heady optimism surrounding the industry, and a report in 2006 by AT Kearney projected a four-fold jump to 2,000 screens by 2009-10. Even the stock markets came to love the multiplex story, with five players raising Rs 637 crore during this phase.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Cut to 2013 and with around 1,200 multiplex screens, the industry is nowhere close to that figure. The economic downturn was to blame for the reversal of fortunes &mdash; occupancy levels fell as people cut back on spending, fewer movies were being made and multiplex companies with considerable debt were bleeding. Some like Fame Cinemas had to sell off and many single screen cinemas went out of business.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>The Right Moves</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The industry emerged wiser from the slowdown but it remains highly fragmented. Consolidation was inevitable. In November 2012 PVR took a 69.27% stake in Cinemax for Rs 395 crore, catapulting it as India&rsquo;s largest multiplex operator, ahead of Inox-Fame and Big Cinemas (<em>see: Box office king</em>). With the open offer completed where it mopped an additional 23% for Rs 136 crore, PVR now owns 93% of Cinemax with the help of private equity investors. Private equity investors Multiples Alternate Asset Management and L capital invested Rs 235 crore to part fund the acquisition. &ldquo;We have been having discussions with Cinemax for around two years. While for some, the strategy has been to take over distressed assets and turn it around, we wanted to acquire a profitable asset and improve on it through economies of scale,&rdquo; says Arora.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Box office king- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">At one time, Inox was reportedly gunning for the Essel Group-owned Fun Cinemas, which has 80 screens. CEO Alok Tandon declined to comment on that, but says, &ldquo;We have always used acquisitions as our growth strategy. We were the first to make an acquisition when we picked up Kolkata&rsquo;s 89 Cinemas in 2006.&rdquo; The chain&rsquo;s headline-grabbing acquisition of Fame Cinemas in February 2010 came after a bitter tussle with Reliance Mediaworks. Further consolidation is inevitable, according to Fame Cinemas founder Shravan Shroff. &ldquo;It will happen sooner than later. The multiplex industry will be similar to the telecom industry where only two or three strong players will dominate the market. The going will get tougher for the smaller players,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We have always used acquisition as a growth strategy. We were the first to make an acquisition" - Alok Tandon, CEO, Inox</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The film exhibition industry in India is heavily fragmented with single screen theatres dominating the 12,000 plus screens across the country. What&rsquo;s startling, though, is that with merely 10% of the total screens, multiplexes control two-thirds of box-office revenues. Consolidation could give them even greater power and that has film producers worried. &ldquo;It is true that multiplexes have brought in a greater level of transparency to the entertainment business. However, a development such as PVR acquiring Cinemax results in a monopolistic situation. Producers here are often arm-twisted,&rdquo; points out Mukesh Bhatt, chairman, Vishesh Films.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The multiplex industry will be similar to the telecom where only 2-3 strong players will dominate the market" - Shravan Shroff, founder, Fame Cinemas</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Producers and exhibitors each split revenues by half during the first week of a film&rsquo;s release. By the fourth week, the producer gets a 30% share. That could change soon. &ldquo;There will be pressure on renegotiating those rates,&rdquo; says Shroff. &ldquo;It may not happen immediately but once the dust settles on consolidation, it will. They will start with smaller films and after some time for the larger ones, as well,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Show And Tell</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The growing heft of multiplex operators could give them a stronger bargaining plank with mall developers too. But much of that hinges on the progress of mall development across the country. &ldquo;About 80% success in our business depends on picking the right location and the right developer,&rdquo; points out PVR&rsquo;s Arora.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"About 80% success in our business depends on picking the right location and the right developer" - Pramod Arora, president and CEO, PVR Cinemas</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In 2012, the industry lost out on 150 additional screens as the malls that were to house them weren&rsquo;t completed on time. &ldquo;Any delay in the construction of shopping malls will dent our ability to grow,&rdquo; says Milan Saini, CEO, Cinepolis. The world&rsquo;s fourth-largest and Mexico&rsquo;s largest multiplex chain entered India in 2008 and now runs 49 screens across nine properties.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There is one silver lining, though &mdash; lease rentals have dropped to reasonable levels. &ldquo;Post the slump in 2008-09, there is an element of realism in terms of rental expectations. People are realising that theatres and hypermarkets are really what drive footfalls into the malls,&rdquo; says Ashok Ganapathy, CEO, Big Cinemas. In the next one year, PVR, along with Cinemax, plans to add about 130 screens, while Cinepolis could add another 60-100 screens in 2013. Inox Leisure plans to add 75-100 screens to take its total to 375 screens by 2014. For Big Cinemas, whose parent company Reliance Mediaworks is weighed under heavy losses, there will be fewer additions this year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Any delay in the consturction of shopping malls will dent our ability to grow" - Milan Saini, CEO, Cinepolis</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Much of these plans hinges on movies that can draw audiences in. A string of smaller-budget films catering to the multiplex audience &mdash; <em>Vicky Donor</em> and <em>Kahaani</em>, among others &mdash; have helped create this demand. Digitisation has ensured that more Hollywood movies are now dubbed in regional languages, and developments in 3D technology have enhanced the movie viewing experience.</p>\n<p class="p3">All this comes at a time when, ironically, the shelf life of a movie has shrunk tremendously. &ldquo;You now see revenues peaking in the first weekend because the next one has another set of attractions coming in. Producers are making their money much faster and moving on to other revenue streams like DTH,&rdquo; echoes Uday Singh, managing director, Motion Pictures Distributors Association. He points to Kamal Haasan&rsquo;s unsuccessful attempt to release his film <em>Vishwaroopam</em> on direct-to-home a day earlier than its stated theatre release, as a case in point.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The other real threat for the industry continues to be piracy. According to a report by Ernst &amp; Young, the Indian film industry loses nearly $1 billion in revenue due to piracy. &ldquo;It is something we would like to control because it clearly continues to impact our growth,&rdquo; says Inox&rsquo;s Tandon. While he admits digitisation has helped, Tandon pegs revenue loss due to piracy at a staggering 40%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Entertainment tax on ticket sales varies between 30% and 60% depending on the state the theatre is located in. In Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, ticket prices are capped as well. That puts margins from ticket sales under pressure. Growing non-ticket revenues, chiefly from food and beverages and advertising &mdash; where margins are around 60% &mdash; therefore becomes critical for profitability to improve. While non-ticket revenues for the industry have doubled since 2008 to 30%, there is enough room to grow further as these are in the 50-60% range in overseas markets. Multiplexes are addressing this opportunity by charging a fee for movie trailers screened at prime slots during weekends, tying up with brands for promotions, charging for displays inside the theatre that were otherwise free, and innovating on food and beverages offerings. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">At Rs 2-2.5 crore per screen, setting up multiplexes is a capital-intensive business that&rsquo;s really not for everyone. Shroff says consolidation will gather steam over the next couple of years as smaller players such as Fun, DT, Wave and SPI join forces with larger multiplex chains. Hopefully, the industry&rsquo;s new avatar will be a profitable one.&nbsp;</p>', 'India''s multiplex industry could finally be waking up to profits and a new lease of life', '6', '', 0, '', 'the-real-picture-275', 270, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'The real picture', 'India''s multiplex industry could finally be waking up to profits and a new lease of life', '', '', '', 'PVR Cinemas,Inox Leisure,Reliance Mediaworks,Multiplex', 0, NULL, '2015-01-28 12:19:18', '2015-01-28 12:34:20', '2013-03-30', 0);

One, you hurriedly eject her as damsels are just not your type, two, pass in favour of someone more participative or three, damn the consequences and make the most of it. Well, the promoters of Bharati Shipyard opted for choice number three when a vulnerable Great Offshore sauntered into their deckhouse. The resulting shipwreck is not only unsightly but painful to many. During the takeover frenzy that culminated in January 2010, Great Offshore&rsquo;s market cap reached Rs 2,100 crore and Bharati topped out at Rs 950 crore. Now, Great Offshore is called GOL Offshore and like its first name, the market cap has shrunk to #272 crore, while Bharati&rsquo;s market cap has sunk to Rs 140 crore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Let&rsquo;s now hear what PC Kapoor (PK) and Vijay Kumar (VK), the promoters of Bharati Shipyard think about this carnage in shareholder wealth at Bharati and GOL. They believe it is incorrect to question the value addition created by the acquisition of GOL Offshore by looking at the current market cap. Says VK, &ldquo;Valuing GOL only on the market cap parameter would be incorrect, as it is a temporary phenomenon and the situation will change once the market improves.&rdquo; PK made our jaw drop even more when he said, &ldquo;Market cap would come into the picture if we were planning to sell our shares, which we are not.&rdquo; The promoters failed to mention that this decimation in shareholder value is an outcome of rising debt incurred to fund the acquisition and poor execution thereafter, which left Bharati with no option but to opt for a corporate debt restructuring (CDR) scheme. The state of affairs at GOL is not much better either, with the company having defaulted on its loans and delayed repayment to its FCCB holders.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Market cap would come into the picture if we were planning to sell our shares, which we are not" - PC Kapoor, chairman, GOL and MD, Bharati Shipyard</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Post the CDR, Bharati is trying to resurrect itself. But a CDR is no cakewalk: consortium lending has its own push, pulls and politics, so some banks may have agreed in principle, but may not release payments in time, thereby hindering smooth operations. Notwithstanding that, there is still a question on business viability. Ramesh Singhal, managing director, i-maritime Consultancy, the agency that had submitted the techno economic viability (TEV) report says, &ldquo;The TEV was done when the financials were a little healthy. On today&rsquo;s financials, we would have recommended something more stringent. In the report, we included a lot of caveats, the details of which I cannot share due to a NDA signed by us.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The problem, says another consultant is that typically banks ignore the fine print and endorse the base case given by an independent consultant. That means even if i-maritime may have highlighted that Bharati&rsquo;s recovery is contingent on GOL&rsquo;s ability to support its own orderbook, the banks may not have evaluated GOL&rsquo;s financial strength. A fact that was admitted by SBI Caps itself. Supratim Sarkar, group head, project advisory &amp; structured finance group, was livid when called up for details on the basis of which the CDR was approved. But amid the dressing-<span class="s1">down he gave this writer for asking probing questions, he did say that Bharati&rsquo;s assessment did not include GOL despite a common promoter. If there was a gaping diligence hole, this had to be it.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class="p4">Almost everybody associated with the company we spoke to for the story tried their best to stonewall us. Leading from the front, of course, was the Bharati management. Their response to <em>Outlook Business</em> queries resembled the work in progress at its yards &mdash; delayed, incomplete and unseaworthy but one that carried a questionable promise of future delivery. While on the face of it, the acquisition of GOL by Bharati may seem like bad timing, dive a little deeper and you get intrigue, opportunistic greed that backfired, a boatload of debt that may never get a safe harbour and a lot of investors who may never see any return on capital.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Yours is mine</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">For those who came in late, let&rsquo;s start with intrigue. Until December 2008, the then 16-year association between the founders of Bharati and Vijay Sheth who ran Great Offshore (after it was demerged from Great Eastern Shipping) was a harmonious one. Sheth had pledged his holding to raise money to pay off his cousins to buy their holding in Great Offshore following the demerger. As the value of the pledged shares had eroded, the financiers were badgering Sheth for more collateral. The comfort Sheth had with Bharati prompted him to turn to PK and VK in his hour of need. And this is where things get hazy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">It seems that while Sheth&rsquo;s SOS was responded to, his life jacket was probably yanked before he could pull it on. Though they threw a credit line in November 2008, in early May 2009 PK and VK issued a repayment notice to Sheth. Since Sheth could not raise the money required in the &ldquo;notice period of two days&rdquo;, PK and VK invoked the pledge and bought 14.89% of Great Offshore and announced it was &ldquo;a strategic long-term investment.&rdquo; Before the ink had dried on the press release, rumours of an open offer started doing the rounds. Evidently, PK and VK&rsquo;s intention of holding &ldquo;a strategic long-term investment&rdquo; had transformed into an unexplained desire for ownership. That Sheth was not in agreement with the actions of the Bharati promoters is evident when he resigned as managing director of Great Offshore just before the open offer. Vijay Sheth refused to come on record and tell us his side of the story.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">While it is still not clear to us as to what prompted the need for an open offer in May 2009, the explanation bandied around was that Sheth&rsquo;s resigning amounted to a change in management. PK had then said, &ldquo;The purpose of the open offer is to consolidate the investment in Great Offshore. This acquisition will provide enhanced stability to the existing management in Great Offshore and maximise shareholder value for both the companies.&rdquo; Precisely what Bharati has failed to achieve. And the explanation for getting into a bidding war that ensued after ABG Shipyard jumped into the fray: &ldquo;At that time 35% of the orderbook was with Great Offshore, what if it had gone to a competitor?&rdquo; Well, the bidding war only happened after the status quo was disturbed; until then the Sheth-led Great Offshore was always on your side!</p>\n<p class="p4">Opportunism aside, the acquisition came at a great cost to Bharati&rsquo;s balance sheet. Not only did it overpay, it has not been able to reap the much talked-about synergies. The management&rsquo;s contention was that being in the offshore industry GOL would help take care of the cyclicality in Bharati&rsquo;s shipbuilding business. But that hasn&rsquo;t happened. Tarun Agarwal, associate, i-maritime, says, &ldquo;Acquisitions work well when there is a good handover from the people who are passing the baton. Companies are run by people and if they are not supportive of you, it cannot be successful.&rdquo; That surely stands true for Bharati as, without Sheth, the new owners did not know how to run the offshore business. Blaming the current condition on recession then was the most convenient thing to do. Another mystifying fact is that even as Bharati was digesting GOL, it went ahead and bought Tebma Shipyards.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>"GOL''s debts have increased on account of loans to subsidiaries to acquire the jack-up rig" - Vijay Kumar, managing director, Bharati Shipyard</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">Besides the acquisitions, Bharati also mistimed the expansion at its Dabhol and Mangalore yards. Not only was the Mangalore yard delayed, the resulting capex took its toll. The plan was to use the Dabhol yard to make jack-up rigs and move up the value chain. But given the management&rsquo;s lack of expertise, the delivery of the jack-up rig was delayed and a result the customer (GOL) lost an ONGC order that could have fetched $250 million in revenue over five years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Liquid rescue</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">The entire focus now is on turning around the ailing shipbuilder. The management&rsquo;s turnaround plan involves completing the current orderbook, getting more defence orders and sweating the assets at GOL. VK says the company plans to complete its existing orderbook of 68 vessels in the next two and a half years. &ldquo;We have indicated to our bankers that if these 68 vessels are delivered over the next two and a half years, debt would come down by Rs 1,500-2,000 crore.&rdquo; How realistic is that, given the company&rsquo;s execution history? The highest number of vessels delivered in the company&rsquo;s history was in FY09 &mdash; and that is eight.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">That track record looks worse when you consider the company&rsquo;s accounting policy. Its annual report states, &ldquo;The company books subsidy when the vessels are nearing completion i.e. when the vessel is more than 70% complete.&rdquo; In FY11, Bharati booked a subsidy income of Rs 210.78 crore and delivered five vessels. Then for FY12, the company booked subsidy income of Rs 294.41 crore and delivered four vessels. If indeed many vessels had crossed the completion stage in FY11 and FY12, those deliveries should have reflected in FY13. Instead, the turnover for the nine months of FY13 collapsed 60% from Rs 979.56 crore to Rs 399.96 crore. Part of the explanation could be that work at yards has stopped due to slow disbursement of CDR funds, but what about the work that had reached more than 70% stage and where subsidy was booked? At least the remainder revenue for the final stage should have shown up. PK and VK cannot even blame interests costs for the net loss of #373 crore &mdash; interest cost for the period under consideration is Rs 320 crore compared with Rs 331 crore last year. At this pace it will not be surprising if Bharati ends up delivering only three or four vessels in FY13.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Then again, while defence orders are seen as a key driver of revenues, the management itself says, &ldquo;Orders from defence has come in the last couple of years only and value-wise it comprises only a little above 10%.&rdquo; But with every shipbuilder eyeing that segment, defence orders may get you bread but not much butter or jam. As for business from other Indian offshore players, it&rsquo;s only getting tougher. Uncertain execution at Indian shipyards has meant that Great Eastern Shipping and its offshore arm Great Ship source vessels from the best yards worldwide. Anjali Kumar, deputy general manager, corporate finance, Great Eastern Shipping, says, &ldquo;We have one or two vessels built in India but our experience with Indian shipyards has not been very happy. Exploration by its nature is a highly technical business and we do not like to take a technical risk by giving it to a new or smaller yard.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Loose lips sink ships</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">With worsening business, governance is taking a backseat. In FY13, both Bharati and GOL saw a change in auditors. Statutory auditor Kalyaniwalla &amp; Mistry (K&amp;M) resigned from GOL and Bhuta Shah &amp; Co resigned as joint auditor from Bharati. While the management explains the change as &ldquo;good corporate governance practice in line with the new Companies Bill,&rdquo; their version differs from what was stated in the annual report. The development at K&amp;M was strange because the firm seems to have changed its mind in three months about continuing. In May 2012 it communicated its availability and in August 2012, it expressed its &ldquo;unwillingness to continue.&rdquo; This point raised by us about the &ldquo;unwillingness on part of the auditor&rdquo; was conveniently sidestepped by the management.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Vinayak Padwal, auditor at K&amp;M when contacted said, &ldquo;Unwillingness is generally an outcome of either a client taking excessively risky business measures or it becoming uncooperative during audits or the account turning non-remunerative.&rdquo; When pressed further for details on why his audit firm changed its mind in three months, Padwal clammed up citing ethical reasons. Mitesh Kothari, the auditor at Bhuta Shah &amp; Co when asked about the disconnect between the management&rsquo;s version and the auditor&rsquo;s cited reason of pre-occupancy, said that despite the disconnect he stood by his firm&rsquo;s version.</p>\n<p class="p4">It seems, in a great display of pro-active governance, the management decided to change its auditors because they have completed five years. Incidentally DPH &amp; Co, the statutory auditor at Bharati will complete five years in FY13. When asked if they will also replace DPH this year as a measure of good governance, the management had no answer. If Bharati continues with DPH in FY14, the intent behind change of auditors is clearly questionable. Ramesh Lakshman, chartered accountant and founder, RLCO says, &ldquo;If the standard is not applied to all auditors in the group, then it questions the veracity of the claim that change is to meet standards of governance in advance. Any selective application is always a question mark.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Then, there is conflict of interest at play. For an offshore company, having your own yard is a double edge sword &mdash; you can get priority deliveries, but in lean times you are forced to build at your own yard. If that had not been the case you could have gone to the market to get the best price. How do PK &amp; VK, who are members of acquisition/disposal of vessel &amp; real estate committee at GOL, resolve this dilemma? Their obvious claim is an &ldquo;arm&rsquo;s length relationship&rdquo; between Bharati and GOL. How then, do they deal with delivery delays &mdash; apart from the ONGC rig, another three ships of GOL have been delayed. But unlike clients like Clipper which are in litigation with Bharati, GOL has no such luck.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p8">&nbsp;<strong>Leaking oil</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">On the contrary, GOL&rsquo;s financial health has been compromised with a curious rise in loans and advances made to its overseas subsidiary. Usually, shipbuilders pass on cancelled orders to their subsidiaries because any cancellation due to execution delays means that the shipbuilder not only has to refund the advance, but also writeback the subsidy it has availed from the government for the same. Selling off the asset to overseas subsidiary then becomes a convenient escape route. Great Offshore (International) has received substantial loans from GOL. VK admits that GOL&rsquo;s debts have increased primarily on account of loans and advances to subsidiaries for acquiring the jack-up rig. Asked that if the loans were made to be paid to Bharati, why is it being routed through a subsidiary, the company said a subsidiary structure was beneficial to access funds at a cheaper rate and better terms. If that is indeed true, why is the parent lending to it? Why is it not borrowing from the open market? Obviously the previous auditor, too, failed to see the point and had qualified the same in the GOL FY12 annual report.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Between a rock and a hard place - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">What exactly transpired at GOL Offshore between the management and K&amp;M is not clear, but there was constant qualification on the part of the auditor regarding GOL&rsquo;s investment in its KEI-RSOS subsidiary as well as those relating to recognition of mark to market losses arising from derivative instruments like interest rate swaps. The auditor has maintained that the networth of KEI-RSOS has substantially eroded and cash flows are under stress. But the management continues to insist that all is well at KEI-RSOS and states no provision is necessary for the loans and advances of Rs 221.63 crore. In addition, GOL has provided a corporate guarantee of about #145.85 crore. Lakshman says auditors don&rsquo;t just resign because they have qualified the accounts.&nbsp;&ldquo;They might have resigned under pressure from the management who might have told them that they may propose other auditors. Most respectable auditors would not like to be defeated in a vote by management and, hence, submit their resignation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p8">&nbsp;<strong>Over and out</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">GOL has posted a standalone profit of Rs 70.84 crore for the first nine months of FY13. But even in the standalone topline of Rs 679 crore, Rs 82.27 crore came from the sale of ships. If this selling of new ships turns out to be a trend, then that development is worrisome as the average age of GOL&rsquo;s fleet is much older than its most formidable competitor Great Ship. With its old fleet, GOL will find it hard to win business in international markets. India, of course, is a different market with the biggest player being ONGC. The state monolith controls about 75% of the market for offshore drilling and has some very questionable business practices.</p>\n<p class="p4">For instance, when world over the best practice is not to hire vessels that are more than 15 years of age, it is only recently that ONGC fixed a maximum age of 27 years for offshore vessels. But how and why it narrowed down to 27 years is a mystery. Suffice to say that the hard to logically decipher policies of ONGC have kept several Indian offshore companies in business. Great Eastern&rsquo;s Anjali Kumar says, &ldquo;Differential tendering is only being applied to rigs and not to vessels. Thanks to that one business, many companies with older assets are flourishing. They get the same $10,000-12,000 that my modern vessel would get. So, to that extent, Great Ship is at a disadvantage.&rdquo; Among the various offshore companies, Great Ship too counts ONGC as an important customer. &ldquo;Our biggest strength is the age of our fleet and that we do not have an overleveraged balance sheet,&rdquo; adds Anjali Kumar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">The basic difference between Great Ship and GOL is that Great Ship has the flexibility to bid and win international business. It implies that going forward, GOL with its ageing fleet is not only at a disadvantage when bidding for international tenders, all its vessels that are more than 27 years old will find the going tough in ONGC&rsquo;s new tenders. Given Bharati&rsquo;s tardy execution, the only way out for GOL is to buy new vessels from the open market. Here, too, it is constrained due to its financial condition. Of course, the management thinks the liquidity problem is not going to last long. In fact they are confident that GOL, unlike Bharati, will not have to apply for a CDR. VK says, &ldquo;GOL has over Rs 1,200 crore of unleveraged assets. Once these assets are delivered and/or deployed, GOL will not have liquidity issues.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">Despite the financial mess, what is discomforting &mdash; and also what seems to keep the two companies going &mdash; is that in everything they do, there is a government connection. Of the 59 ships in its orderbook, 32 belong to the Indian Navy and Coast Guard. Going forward, the management is banking heavily on new defence orders to improve its cash flows. VK says all the new orders for 10 ships worth Rs 760 crore that Bharati received in FY13 so far are from government clients. Even on the GOL side, the biggest buyer is state-owned ONGC. The lead banker for the Bharati CDR is SBI. Majority of the directors on the boards of both Bharati and GOL have either worked for public sector units or banks. Interestingly, even after all the institutional shareholders had fled Bharati by June 2010, the government&rsquo;s investor of last resort, LIC, continues to stay invested in Bharati Shipyard, having rotated its holding through its various schemes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Of all its misgiving, the most grave governance lapse by the promoters arguably is their decision not to go ahead with a preferential allotment in January 2012 (the offer was to subscribe 1,552,700 convertible warrants at Rs 139 per warrant) stating financial stress, and then agreeing to subscribe to 3.2 crore preferential warrants at Rs 79.12 a share as part of the CDR. The participating banks have also subscribed to 2.88 crore compulsorily convertible debentures at Rs 79.12 amounting to Rs 228.35 crore. Incidentally, that infusion due in 18 months is more than Bharati&rsquo;s current market cap. Post full warrant conversion, about 52-53% of the promoter holding in Bharati will be pledged, according to VK. The biggest holders outside the promoters now are LIC and the consortium of banks that is funding the CDR.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">In hindsight, the GOL acquisition looks opportunistic and not one that was well calculated and thought through. Do the promoters look back and think perhaps things should have been done differently? VK says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we have any regrets. GOL was about 33% of the Bharati orderbook when they operated as independent companies; today GOL&rsquo;s share of the current orderbook is only a little below 50%.&nbsp;This itself is ample proof that GOL has contributed substantially to Bharati.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s here that the story of the golden goose comes to mind. Instead of being content with getting one GOLden egg a day, PK and VK chose to have it all at once.&nbsp;</p>', 'Bharati Shipyard waged a heated battle for control of Great Offshore but the win has only blown up in its face', '2', '', 0, '', 'in-choppy-waters-276', 271, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'In choppy waters', 'Bharati Shipyard waged a heated battle for control of Great Offshore but the win has only blown up in its face', '', '', '', 'GOL Offshore,Bharati Shipyard,Corporate debt restructuring,ONGC', 0, NULL, '2015-01-28 12:35:50', '2015-01-28 13:10:43', '2013-03-30', 0),

(279, 20, '', 'Lost in transit', '<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s the stock market equivalent of a train wreck &mdash; enormous damage and bystanders watching in fascinated horror. In December 2012, Arshiya International was one of the top five stocks Kotak Securities recommended for 2013, assigning a target price of Rs 188 &mdash; it was trading at Rs 120-130. Just a few weeks later, wham! A report in a national daily sent the stock crashing into the lower circuit on January 9. By March 12, it had declined to Rs 29.65, an over 76% fall. Most brokerages have suspended coverage of the stock now and the future looks singularly bleak. Could one small news item really do so much damage to a stock or is there more to the Arshiya story than meets the eye?</p>\n<p class="p3">First, though, what is Arshiya? The Mumbai-based company&rsquo;s claim to fame is the country&rsquo;s first fully functional free trade and warehousing zone (FTWZ) at Panvel outside Mumbai, where goods can be imported and stored for clients ranging from auto giants, pharma companies, luxury goods and consumer electronics brands. The Rs 1,046-crore company is also the second-largest private rail player in India after Gateway and Concor. It&rsquo;s a fairly well-known name in investment circles, with star fund managers like Samir Arora of Helios and Dron Capital&rsquo;s Pathik Gandotra having put money into Arshiya.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">From the looks of it, though, even they were taken aback when a national newspaper reported on January 9 that over the preceding weekend, Arshiya had fired 290 employees, many of them at senior levels. Anonymous ex-employees claimed salaries hadn&rsquo;t been paid since September 2012 and that vendors, too, were owed substantial dues. The most damaging allegation, though, was that Arshiya had misguided investors, lenders and other stakeholders. &ldquo;Inside the books, the company is hollow &mdash; it is a mini-Satyam,&rdquo; one sacked employee charged.</p>\n<p class="p3">The company clarified immediately that it had &ldquo;terminated the services of a few employees based solely on their performance and our internal need to rationalise employee costs&rdquo;, adding that the allegations of financial irregularity were baseless &mdash; but nobody bought the story. &ldquo;Many are questioning the authenticity of on-ground assets and whether the FTWZ land in Panvel and Khurja is in the company&rsquo;s name or not,&rdquo; says an analyst with a leading brokerage firm. Yet another admits that the investor community was caught unawares by the company&rsquo;s actions. &ldquo;Working capital issues had to have been on for a while for salary problems to start but the management continued to paint a rosy picture even until Q2 results. This makes the numbers in their books suspect.&rdquo; (<em>See: Not adding up</em>)</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"There have been certain delays on payments here and there, which is normal in the life cycle of any company" - Ajay Mittal, CMD, Arshiya International</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Arshiya hurriedly organised a concall with the investors where founder and CMD Ajay Mittal declared, &ldquo;I deny all of this; there are no irregularities. There have been certain delays with payments here and there, which is normal in the life cycle of any company; but, besides that, there have been no issues whatsoever.&rdquo; Tellingly, though, there was no mention of legal action against the newspaper that had caused so much wealth erosion for the promoters. There&rsquo;s also no sign of the company declaring its Q3FY13 results any time soon, although the fiscal year is nearly over. As damage control measures go, this fell way short of expectations and two months later, the stock is still slipping.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>What went wrong?</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Arshiya&rsquo;s troubles started when a bank (Punjab National Bank, as per sources) cancelled the loan facility for the company&rsquo;s phase 2 development at the Khurja (Uttar Pradesh) FTWZ in October 2012, despite having earlier agreed to financial closure. The burden on the company immediately shot up from the estimated Rs 100 crore to Rs 160 crore and Mittal mentioned during the concall that Arshiya will have to pay an even further Rs 25 crore towards contracts signed after the financial closure (the company already has debt, including working capital, of about Rs 2,430 crore on its books as of September 2012). &ldquo;The bank pulling the plug on the credit line itself raises questions on the credibility of the projects,&rdquo; points out an analyst. &ldquo;It may have seen issues we as investors don&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Not adding up- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">What nobody missed were project execution delays at Khurja; it will be another three months at least before it starts contributing to the topline. &ldquo;Capital infusion of Rs 850 crore is not seeing any revenue generation. With further delay expected, the financial health of the company would be under pressure,&rdquo; explained Emkay Global in a note to investors on January 11 after the concall.</p>\n<p class="p3">Arshiya&rsquo;s highly-leveraged balance sheet has long been a concern; now analysts fear it may need to take on more debt to make the existing capital expenditure work. At the Panvel FTWZ, of the estimated Rs 1,500-crore investment, nearly Rs 1,200 crore has already been spent on land acquisition, levelling the ground, and construction of five state-of-the-art warehouses and dedicated rail services. &ldquo;The company will need another Rs 300 crore for four more warehouses to achieve the operating margins on which it has based its debt repayment projections,&rdquo; predicts an analyst.</p>\n<p class="p3">For now, the Khurja expansion has been shelved. &ldquo;I do not intend to go ahead for at least six months or a year, year and a half, till all assets have been sweated to the maximum,&rdquo; Mittal told investors. That means Arshiya&rsquo;s growth will be slower and its profitability and capacity to repay loans will be affected as well.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Debt trap - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Experts point out that this was a disaster waiting to happen. Gaurav Parikh, co-founder of Jeena Scriptech Alpha Advisors, says his company had recommended an &lsquo;avoid&rsquo; call on the scrip even before this turn of events. &ldquo;This mid-cap company was behaving like a large-cap company. With just Rs 550 crore net worth, an RoCE of 10% and a relatively high debt-equity ratio, Arshiya had been taking on projects worth thousands of crores. Sooner or later the debt-equity issues had to crop up,&rdquo; says Parikh (<em>see: Debt trap</em>).</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Saving grace</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Efforts are now being made to salvage both, the company&rsquo;s finances and its reputation. The promoters, executive director and chief financial officer announced that they would forego half their pay from October 1 last year and at a board meeting on January 19, the company decided to go in for corporate debt restructuring, for which it has appointed SBI Capital Markets as advisor. Sources within the company say the CDR has been approved in principle and is under process.</p>\n<p class="p3">But it may not be enough, warn analysts. &ldquo;This will be only a temporary relief unless cash flows improve significantly. A CDR may let the company pay instalments later but it still has to pay interest on the debt.&rdquo; For the half year ended September 2012, Arshiya&rsquo;s interest expenses stood at close to Rs 94.9 crore, more than double the Rs 42.4 crore for the same period last year. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">In the concall, Mittal announced that the company was working towards improving cash flow and reducing costs. Apart from firing employees, it is also asking debtors to repay faster.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Why now?</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Arshiya&rsquo;s debt-laden books are old news. So, was the nose dive in its stock price warranted? Emkay Global doesn&rsquo;t think so. &ldquo;We agree with the management&rsquo;s stance that things are blown out of proportion,&rdquo; it wrote. &ldquo;There are some decisions where the company has gone wrong, leading to much more harsh decisions.&rdquo; Not everybody buys that argument, though. &ldquo;Despite such massive debts, the company declared 70% dividend in July [on a face value of Rs 2],&rdquo; points out a visibly disgruntled former employee. &ldquo;The owners are definitely not playing straight.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">It is believed that most cases of mid-cap share price plunges involve large-scale selling of pledged shares wherein lenders sell shares to recover their money. Arshiya could have faced similar pressures. The promoter group held about 43.5% stake in the company as on February 19. In the January 10 concall, Mittal informed investors that about 62% of the overall holdings was pledged.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In an earlier interview with <em>Outlook Business</em>, Mittal had said that he had pledged his shares for funds to shore up his holdings in the company and called it a measure of his faith in the company. But, as the events that followed proved, it was a bad idea. The sudden sharp fall in the Arshiya stock triggered margin calls for many. An unknown pledgee sold 3.61% of Arshiya&rsquo;s shares in the market between January 9 and 30, while FIIs like Merrill Lynch and Swiss Financial Corporation too offloaded their holdings as the price fell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Making matters worse is the perception that some promoters work with market operators to reroute the money raised through margin funding or pledging of shares to pump up the stock price. But when promoters cannot raise more funds and the operator needs to wind down his positions in a hurry, the cracks start to appear and the result is an Arshiya-like fall.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">For Arshiya to woo investors back will require some serious efforts. More than the CDR getting ratified, an approval from the auditors is the need of the hour. If one were to look at the trailing 12-month EPS numbers, the stock is quoting dirt cheap at 1x P/E and less than 1x book value. But, given that the numbers are suspect, it would be foolhardy to approach the stock as a value buy. In other words, investors are warned against bottom fishing in muddled waters.&nbsp;</p>', 'Financial mismanagement and governance issues have taken the wind off Arshiya''s sails for good', '29', '', 0, '', 'lost-in-transit-279', 274, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Lost in transit', 'Financial mismanagement and governance issues have taken the wind off Arshiya''s sails for good', '', '', '', 'Arshiya International,FTWZ', 0, NULL, '2015-01-28 13:32:36', '2015-01-28 13:52:31', '2013-03-30', 0);

(280, 20, '', 'The mixed mix', '<p class="p1">Gaurakh Nath turns back to speak to us, unconcerned that he&rsquo;s negotiating an autorickshaw through one of Delhi&rsquo;s overcrowded roads. His jaws are working away at chewing and talking, and saliva dribbles from the side of his mouth as he rather incoherently explains why he&rsquo;s not worried about the ban on gutkha in Delhi. He&rsquo;s been getting through four or five pouches of pan masala and gutkha in a day for 15 years, and is determined his habit will continue, even though the Delhi government banned the sale, manufacture, display and storage of all gutkha products in September 2012. &ldquo;I can always find some supply though I may have to pay more than the actual price,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Certainly, the ban on gutkha and other forms of chewing tobacco has been tougher to implement than the state governments anticipated. And this despite 18 states having imposed blanket bans since April 2012 (two of them, Odisha and Uttarakhand, kicked off 2013 with the ban). Despite its image as a cottage industry, gutkha is estimated as a Rs 15,000-20,000 crore business. The Smokeless Tobacco Association, which represents the gutkha and pan masala industry, claims some 40 million people will be directly and indirectly affected by the ban. That includes stakeholders across the packaging and commodities (arecanut, cardamom, etc.) sides to the business, and <em>panwallahs</em>, distributors and stockists, apart from those directly employed by gutkha makers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Chewed up- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Those are big numbers and the pain isn&rsquo;t likely to lessen any time soon &mdash; the ban in Uttar Pradesh will start from April 1; other states such as Tamil Nadu and Assam are mulling over similar strictures; Maharashtra and Odisha have, meanwhile, extended the ban to cover even pan masala.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Why the ban?</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">In 2011, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), a government watchdog, laid the foundations for the ban with a new rule: tobacco and nicotine cannot be used as ingredients in any food product. Based on the suggestion of a national consultation report, this rule was notified under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and it defines &lsquo;food&rsquo; as anything that is partially processed and can be ingested by human beings. SN Mohanty, CEO, FSSAI, justifies: &ldquo;Regulations include tobacco in the items sold as food because gutkha is partially ingested.&rdquo; States can impose annually renewable bans under the regulations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Why is gutkha such a big deal? GATS (the Global Adult Tobacco Survey) says 75% of Indian tobacco consumers (260 million of them) use non-smoking tobacco products such as gutkha, far outnumbering the more visible smokers. There is, of course, a significant and confusing vocabulary of similar products: pan masala is gutkha minus the tobacco; zarda and khaini pack in up to 90% tobacco (sun-dried, with lime); snuff is simply powdered tobacco sniffed up the nostril.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Gutkha, hugely popular as a mouth freshener and stimulant in the Indian subcontinent, is a dry concoction of crushed arecanut (supari), 7-8% tobacco, catechu (a dry, brown extract from the acacia tree), paraffin, slaked lime, and sweet or savoury flavourings, but that&rsquo;s not the least of it &mdash; gutkha is also said to contain 3,095 chemicals, including 28 carcinogenic substances. An Edelweiss sector update says India has the highest global prevalence of oral cancer and 75,000-80,000 new cases are reported every year. Tobacco-related illnesses eat up approximately Rs 30,000 crore in both public and private health services &mdash; that&rsquo;s a full fourth of the country&rsquo;s entire health spending. Oddly enough, the government hasn&rsquo;t directly cited public health reasons for the gutkha ban. The industry&rsquo;s response to the ban is equally mixed up and, er, murky.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Fight or flee</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The gutkha industry is highly fragmented. Dozens of regional players (like Shikhar and Dilbagh in Delhi) dominate the Rs 1-2 per sachet segment. The national market has only a few big names like Manikchand (the MD or RMD brand) and Pan Parag&rsquo;s gutkha variant, which are strong in the Rs 7-10 per sachet segment. Kanpur and Delhi in the north, and Ahmedabad, Vadodra, Goa and Pune in the west, are major manufacturing clusters.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Quite in line with the fragmented nature of the industry, it was a contradictory chorus that arose when the ban took effect &mdash; some say it will be the death knell, others are blas&eacute; and hold the view that this ban, like the other attempts before it, won&rsquo;t change anything. &ldquo;50% of the industry and its markets have already vanished with ban in 14 states,&rdquo; despairs Sanjay Dechan, executive director of the Smokeless Tobacco Association (STA). &ldquo;After April 1, 80% will have vanished.&rdquo; Notably, that&rsquo;s when UP joins the ban.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The makers of the Delhi-based Dilbagh, a local brand, are also pessimistic. &ldquo;It is pointless to talk to media and state our position,&rdquo; says Satyam Bihani, director, Som Fragrances, owner of the brand that comes in third, after Manikchand and DS. &ldquo;The government doesn&rsquo;t hear. Nothing will change.&rdquo; Already, the pain is obvious. Pan Bahar&rsquo;s Sharad Jain admits, &ldquo;I have laid off 20-30 workers after the ban.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Still others are literally fleeing. Partners of Trimurti Fragrances&rsquo; Shikhar gutkha have relocated to Mumbai from Delhi. Sarvesh Aggarwal, who was still listed as a board member in the Shikhar Group&rsquo;s website at the time of writing, is cagey about their future plans, &ldquo;We have already shifted to Mumbai for good and we will be trying something else here.&rdquo; Not everybody has taken such drastic steps, or not yet anyway. Delhi-based units have moved their facilities to Noida and Kanpur. But that reprieve will last only for a couple of months more.</p>\n<p class="p3">Ankur Kumar, proprietor of the Delhi-based Sara Tobacco, who claims to have advised several tobacco entrepreneurs in setting up their businesses, does not believe this is a do-or-die situation. &ldquo;Gutkha makers have amassed untold wealth over decades &mdash; many of them own malls and other businesses already. It [the ban] should not be a survival issue for them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Then there&rsquo;s Dharampal Satyapal (DS) Group, the biggest player with its Rajnigandha brand, which is challenging the government in various courts. Despite repeated requests, the company declined to comment for this story but local vendors point out its ingenious way of ensuring sales continue. The DS Group sells Rajnigandha Pan Masala paired with sachets of Tulsi Tobacco &mdash; pop both into the mouth and, voila, there&rsquo;s &lsquo;legal&rsquo; gutkha. Of course, it&rsquo;s not the only company offering this completely legal way of circumventing the ban &mdash; many other former gutkha brands are now available as two separate pouches of pan masala and chewing tobacco.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>New Avenues</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Interestingly, many big names in gutkha, like Pan Bahar, originated in Kanpur before moving to Delhi. Such mobility is possible because gutkha manufacturing is a simple process &mdash; all it needs is 8-10 small machines and 15-20 workers. HK Paliwal, who does packaging for gutkha makers in Kanpur, nods at the re-reversal, &ldquo;Yes, many Delhi-based makers have either activated their old set-up here, or are using other people&rsquo;s platform to produce gutkha.&rdquo; Paliwal, though, is already casting about for other business. &ldquo;The same machines can be used for packaging small biscuits and <em>daal-bhujiya</em> packets,&rdquo; says the canny businessman.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Meanwhile, fragrance makers, like the Kanpur-based Bluebell Fragrances&rsquo; owner Jatin Gupta, are also worried. More than 250 fragrance makers like him from Kanpur and Kannauj (a small town 80 km away) will lose 90% of their market from April. Gupta laments, &ldquo;Everybody is considering supplying soap and <em>agarbatti</em> fragrances but it won&rsquo;t be as big as gutkha for us.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Hard to swallow - Graphic</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Meanwhile, the mere mention of cigarettes causes heartburn to gutkha makers, whose lobby issued big advertisements in dailies, calling the ban unjustified, pointing out that cigarettes contain more tobacco than gutkha. &ldquo;The entire banning exercise is aimed at gifting one company the entire market,&rdquo; lashes out Dechan, referring to ITC, which controls 85% of the cigarettes industry in India. The gutkha lobby cites the rise in ITC&rsquo;s stock prices over the past six months and analyst reports on the company recommend that investors buy the stock.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The entire banning exercise is aimed at gifting one company the entire market" - Sanjay Dechan, executive director, Smokeless Tobacco Federation</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">But is this a perfect zero-sum game as the lobby makes it out to be? No, say analysts. &ldquo;The low-end cigarette brands might benefit but it doesn&rsquo;t start immediately,&rdquo; says Abneesh Rai, analyst, Edelweiss Securities. &ldquo;ITC&rsquo;s growth has been flattish in the last two quarters. Cigarettes will gain slightly after some years.&rdquo; He feels there is still a big price gap between gutkha and cigarettes, and also that cigarettes are a far more visible and taboo product. &ldquo;Women and children who eat &lsquo;gutkha&rsquo; may not switch to cigarettes,&rdquo; says Rai.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Dechan does not hesitate to blame officials in the health ministry and the FSSAI, who he says serve the cigarette lobby&rsquo;s interests. &ldquo;They keep sending advisories to state governments on banning gutkha, and threaten them by denying funds under the NHRM [the National Rural Health Mission, a central scheme implemented by the states] if they fail to implement the ban,&rdquo; says a frustrated Dechan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In Ahmedabad, Bhikubhai Patel has a different question. &ldquo;Why has zarda been spared and gutkha banned when zarda is far more hazardous with almost 90% tobacco?&rdquo; asks the president of the Gujarat Tobacco Merchants Association. Patel feels Gujarat farmers, who supply approximately 90% of the tobacco used in products like gutkha, khaini and zarda, won&rsquo;t take such a big hit now because gutkha is only a small part of the tobacco market. But far-sighted farmers in Anand, Baroda and Khera aren&rsquo;t taking any changes &mdash; they are already shifting to alternative crops like banana. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Why has zarda been spared and gutkha banned when zarda is far more hazardous with almost 90% tobacco?" - Bhiku Patel, president, Tobacco Merchants Association</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Meanwhile, gutkha makers seem to be counting on the separate sachets strategy to work. &ldquo;If some one has a sweet tooth, he has it for life,&rdquo; says an official from a big gutkha brand, who does not wish to be named. Anand Bathija, proprietor of Trident Exports, makers of the Kuber brand of gutkha and khaini, is not so sure: &ldquo;Erstwhile gutkha makers will have to work really hard to make this mix-two-sachets route works as handsomely as single-sachet gutkha.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">How&rsquo;s the ban working? Says Sunil Singh, state nodal officer of the National Tobacco Control Programme in Rajasthan, &ldquo;So far, we have conducted inspections at 31,000 places after the ban and destroyed 8 million gutkha sachets. Trucks that were smuggling in the product have been seized. We have also started a toll-free helpline for people who want to quit the tobacco habit.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Other states offer similar positive news. Says Ashish Singhmar, deputy commissioner of Hamirpur district in Himachal Pradesh, &ldquo;Open sale has been checked since the ban. The police and food and health safety departments have been checking and conducting raids regularly.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">But dig deeper and check with petty officials across most states, and a different picture emerges. The police in all states is already overburdened and elections are around the corner &mdash; nabbing gutkha sellers and stopping manufacture is hardly a priority.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">STA&rsquo;s Dechan feels the ban will drive the gutkha industry underground. He is already almost right. Bhini Prasad, owner of a cramped corner store in Karol Bagh, does not display the gutkha he sells, but fishes it out surreptitiously from a rack hidden away inside. &ldquo;It comes from UP,&rdquo; he says <em>sotto voce</em>. &ldquo;We sell to our special customers at a Rs 2 premium.&rdquo; <span class="s1">&beta;</span>&nbsp;</p>', 'What will happen to gutkha manufacturers as state after state bans all forms of chewing tobacco?', '9', '', 0, '', 'the-mixed-mix-280', 275, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'The mixed mix', 'What will happen to gutkha manufacturers as state after state bans all forms of chewing tobacco?', '', '', '', 'Gutkha ban,Tobacco,Manikchand,Pan Parag', 0, NULL, '2015-01-28 13:55:03', '2015-01-28 15:06:25', '2013-03-30', 0),

The 41-year-old president and CEO of MTS India collects airline time-tables and reads them cover-to-cover. That means poring over airline departures and arrivals from various airports, the types of aircraft and cabin composition, terminal numbers, distance between airports and city centres, and connecting flight options. Armed with this knowledge, &ldquo;you can make your trip more than the movement between destinations. You can turn it into an adventure,&rdquo; says Rozanov.</p>\n<p class="p3">So far he&rsquo;s amassed over 300 time-table booklets of around 40 airlines from 35 countries, some even of obscure airlines such as Atlantic Airways of Faroe Islands and Slovenia&rsquo;s Adria Airways. That makes him popular among those who know him closely. &ldquo;If they want to get somewhere, they ask me.&rdquo; His wife, however, doesn&rsquo;t take too kindly to this growing pile in the study of his Moscow home. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always a conspiracy against those books in my family.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s an interest that began with collecting railway timetables as a young boy in Moscow. Later, for the economics graduate from Lomonosov Moscow State University, this fascination turned to airline pocket guides. So much so that he says, &ldquo;In the 1990s my friends knew the best gift for me was a guide of a less-known airline.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Rozanov finds the Lufthansa time-tables &ldquo;really convenient&rdquo;. He has 40 of them. Those of Chinese airlines, he says, &ldquo;look quite messy and it&rsquo;s hard to find connections&rdquo;. Most major airlines &mdash; with the exception of some like Emirates, which continues to print quarterly flight schedules &mdash; have now gone digital and stopped printing free time-tables. That leaves him with the OAG pocket flight guides for regular company now. These aren&rsquo;t free though, and at $320 for an annual subscription, they cover nearly all destinations and airlines in every country across the world. There&rsquo;s a key difference between trawling the internet for flight information, and looking it up on a pocket guide, Rozanov explains. &ldquo;On the internet you should know what you are looking for.

What we did, instead, is observe the extremely sterile process of grapes being transported from the vineyard in refrigerated vans, rolling down the conveyor belt with nitrogen capsules thrown in to keep the temperature cool while factory workers removed any remaining leaves, stems or spoilt and damaged grapes before they were crushed by machines, and moved to massive stills in which the fermentation would take place.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The winemaking process is a complex one, and the winery &mdash; arguably India&rsquo;s most sophisticated &mdash; has it down pat: from crushing and storage in imported oak barrels to the perfect ageing, blending, bottling, labeling and so on, all of it fully automated, laying the foundations for a heritage that its premium brand Ritu &mdash; which may sound banal here in India, but has recall value in markets overseas for its two-syllable pronunciation &mdash; has been garnering internationally. And in 2013, in addition to its portfolio of Four Seasons wines, the winery will gradually introduce the Ritu label pan-India, as a superior alternate to its portfolio of Four Seasons wines.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Four Seasons and Ritu form part of Vijay Mallya&rsquo;s staggering United Breweries range and consists of wines that Kewadkar claims as part of the Sahayadri terroir and consistent climate that, he insists, will give him a vintage year every year, a boast no one has been able to make in any other part of the world, but which he hopes to make good by marking each year on the label. (Internationally, vintage years enjoy exceptional value in terms of price, which is what makes Kewadkar&rsquo;s claim audacious, though there is something to be said about the predictability of the weather in the Nashik valley, give or take the possibility of freak hailstorms, in which case, he says, he will not produce wines with those grapes.)</p>\n<p class="p3">For the few of us fortunate to be the first guests at the winery &mdash; where wine tourism will be introduced a few months from now for those wanting to experience life on a vineyard complete with tastings of different varietals &mdash; it was an opportunity to pair food with wine: experimental and exploratory more than appropriate, but it did set the tenor for the sauvignon blanc (thumbs up), a viognier, and the cabernet sauvignon and barrique reserve, both reds that master of wine David Bird described as &ldquo;full-bodied, complex with ageing potential&rdquo;, adding what some of us might have echoed, &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">The dry, undulating countryside of the Ghats around the winery has a crisp climate ideal for sauvignon and chenin grapes (the late harvest chenic blanc proving itself an interesting aperitif wine for many), 50 acres put under cultivation by the company, with a further 300 acres planted under long-term contract with local farmers. The wine itself is made under the supervision of Bouvet Ladubay, the premium French winery that Mallya snapped up in 2006.

(286, 12, '', 'Chasing a common goal', '<p class="p1">Going by the unbridled optimism and crowding of e-commerce space in India, a shakeup was waiting to happen. And it did, mostly through 2012. According to Venture Intelligence, a provider of data and analysis on private equity, venture capital and M&amp;A deals, as many as 15 M&amp;A deals were struck &mdash; notably, Flipkart-Letsbuy, Snapdeal&rsquo;s-esportsbuy, Myntra-Exclusively.in and Shersingh, Fashionandyou-Urbantouch and Zovi-Inkfruit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Almost all these had common investors, and this makes them &ldquo;pseudo mergers&rdquo;, says Mahesh Murthy, co-founder at early stage fund Seedfund. &ldquo;It is a case of the same investor having money in two companies, so if one company is doing better than the other, the investor takes money and puts it into the other company.&rdquo; A merger in the true sense that has different investors on either side aiming for a strategic fit is difficult to conclude right now. &ldquo;Mergers with different investors are yet to begin, as people are holding on or there is a disagreement on valuation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The ones that sold out did so either because they ran out of cash or they could not compete with bigger players. &ldquo;It becomes difficult for a niche player, say, a baby products site to compete with larger sites that sell everything from babywear to electronics,&rdquo; says Rajesh Nahar, founder and CEO of ethnic wear e-tailer, Cbazaar.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Time for a good buy- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In most cases, the acquiring company shut down the acquired brand, integrating the latter&rsquo;s operations into its fold. Ashutosh Lawania, co-founder of Myntra, which acquired Shersingh last November, says it didn&rsquo;t make sense to maintain two sites. The Shersingh brand of products are now being sold on Myntra.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Kashyap Dalal, CEO and founder of Inkfruit, a private label apparel and accessories company that was acquired by private label fashion e-tailer, Zovi, in February this year, has a different view. &ldquo;It will be a huge loss of value to both if one of the sites is shut down,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We will integrate the technology and look at having cross-linkages to products on both the sites. For the near future, the front-end of both the sites will continue.&rdquo; With SAIF Partners as the common investor, Dalal explains that the merger was not driven by investor interests alone. &ldquo;We found Zovi to be the best option and when you have a common investor it makes the process simpler,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In the coming year, the estimated Rs 50-60,000 crore e-commerce market could see more M&amp;As. Only, this time, it could be the coming together of bigger players of equal standing. The Zovi-Inkfruit deal, is one of private brand retailers with similar valuations, is probably an indication of things to unfold.&nbsp;</p>', 'E-commerce war prompts investors to merge portfolio companies ', '30', '', 0, '', 'chasing-a-common-goal-286', 281, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Chasing a common goal', 'E-commerce war prompts investors to merge portfolio companies ', '', '', '', 'E-commerce,M&As,Private equity,Venture capital', 0, NULL, '2015-01-28 16:21:29', NULL, '2013-04-13', 0),
(287, 12, '', 'A whole new game', '<p class="p1">In 2007, Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce.com met Sridhar Vembu, founder of California-based Zoho Corp, which also has an office in Chennai, with an offer to buy him out. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Google is going to crush you guys with their Office suite. We can help you,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Vembu, recollecting the meeting. &ldquo;This reminded me of the story where a bear chases two friends. One friend tells another, &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t outrun the bear&rsquo;. The other one immediately says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to outrun the bear. I just have to outrun you&rsquo;. Similarly, with Google chasing me, I thought I don&rsquo;t have to outrun Google, I just have to stay ahead of Salesforce.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">That is easier said than done. But the company, known as AdventNet in its previous avatar, has managed to carve a niche in a marketplace where big boys like Microsoft, Google and Salesforce play, through products that match its global peers at reasonable prices. Launched in 1996, it initially sold network management software &mdash; now the oldest division, WebNMS. Post the dotcom recession, AdventNet revamped its portfolio in 2004 to offer enterprise IT products through ManageEngine, the largest division in the company. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">A year later, online communication, business and productivity applications such as email, word processors and spreadsheets, customer resource management (CRM), project management and invoicing were introduced through its third division, Zoho.com. The company was rechristened to Zoho Corp in 2009 as the division became more popular. Today, the division contributes 25% to the company&rsquo;s overall revenue of $150 million. Vembu expects its contribution to double over the next couple of years.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Road less travelled</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Most of Zoho Corp&rsquo;s customers are small and medium businesses. The US is its largest market, contributing 55% of revenues, followed by the UK and Japan. India brings in only 5% of business. As more and more businesses move to the cloud, online applications like Zoho&rsquo;s have a huge opportunity ahead. &ldquo;When Google entered this space, they validated the market,&rdquo; says Raju Vegesna, chief evangelist, Zoho Corporation. &ldquo;Until then people were not sure whether online apps was a sustainable business or just some new trend that would go away in time.&rdquo; Google&rsquo;s entry also disrupted the market, putting many smaller players out of business. &ldquo;When we entered the online word processing space, there were 17 vendors. When Google came in, they managed to clear out the other 16,&rdquo; says Vegesna.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Zoho Corp- Element</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">How did Zoho survive? It focused on segments Google wasn&rsquo;t serving, namely business applications such as CRM, project management, accounting and invoicing. While it competes against Google on five of its offerings &mdash; email, calendar, spreadsheets, documents and presentations, Zoho is the largest software provider on Google Apps Marketplace. Vegesna says Zoho&rsquo;s products can easily integrate with Google apps and that&rsquo;s a big advantage. For instance, not only can you import your contact list from Gmail to Zoho&rsquo;s CRM, every time you receive an email, it automatically syncs with Zoho&rsquo;s CRM.</p>\n<p class="p3">Over the years, Zoho managed to scale up without external funding and Vembu is clear about not accepting VC money. &ldquo;Most VCs are finance guys who can do spreadsheets well. But you cannot predict the success of a business in a spreadsheet.&rdquo; He also points that once a business accepts VC money, it is committed to provide an exit through an IPO or a stake sale to a larger company within a time frame, both of which he isn&rsquo;t comfortable with.</p>\n<p class="p3">Unlike most software firms, Zoho doesn&rsquo;t necessarily require employees to come with a college degree. Vembu feels most colleges are a waste of time since graduates are not always employable. You may think that&rsquo;s rich coming from someone who went to Princeton for his PhD after IIT-Madras. But he says it was during his Princeton days that he realised he was wasting his time there. To prove a point that high school students can be as good, if not better, than engineering graduates, he started Zoho University in Chennai in 2005. Students, aged 17-18 years, are chosen mainly from tier I and II towns, go through a series of tests before they are admitted. They are then trained in software programming, applications building and basic communication skills for a year. This is followed by product training for six months. After two years they become permanent employees of the firm. Zoho University&rsquo;s dean B Rajendran finds the students smarter than some of the engineering graduates he has taught before. &ldquo;They pick up programming within a couple of months despite the fact that some have never seen a computer before in their lives,&rdquo; he says. Students from the University make up 15% of its workforce, and Vembu wants to take that number to 30-35% in five years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Smart moves</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Even as the company chooses to take an unconventional stance on recruitment and financing, it&rsquo;s ruthlessly focused on innovating and developing products at lower cost, explains Vegesna: &ldquo;We follow the 80:20 rule. 80% of our efforts are on engineering and 20% of our efforts on marketing.&rdquo; This allows the company to price its products competitively. Zoho Corp&rsquo;s enterprise CRM product, for example, is priced at $25 per user per month compared to Salesforce&rsquo;s offering at $125 per user per month. &ldquo;Our customers do the marketing for us. We get a lot of customers through word-of-mouth references. People may come for the price but stay for the product,&rdquo; says Vembu. The company also offers free trials and customers can sign up for the paid version if they are satisfied.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Pitted against heftier opponents, Vembu knows he needs to be on his toes all the time. &ldquo;We have the challenge of not being taken seriously. So we need to constantly innovate and develop products that are the best in their category or at least be able to compete with the best,&rdquo; he says. Next on the cards is the launch of mobile applications&mdash;Zoho already has 20-odd mobile apps and is looking to launch another 15 next year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Vegesna says that in the products business, market conditions could be disrupted overnight, as Google and Apple have shown. Such disruptions often end monopolies &mdash; as was the case with Microsoft when Google&rsquo;s online Office suite was launched &mdash; and create opportunities for smaller challengers to carve a niche. Vembu is looking to build just that kind of company. &nbsp;</p>', 'What makes software applications company Zoho Corp a challenger to Google, Microsoft and Salesforce?', '6', '', 0, '', 'a-whole-new-game-287', 282, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'A whole new game', 'What makes software applications company Zoho Corp a challenger to Google, Microsoft and Salesforce?', '', '', '', 'Salesforce,Zoho Corp,Google,Microsoft,uuu', 0, NULL, '2015-01-28 16:22:49', '2015-01-28 16:40:31', '2013-04-13', 0);

(288, 12, '', 'Right by your side', '<p class="p1">So, you believe the police is in charge of law and order in India? Think again. For every cop, there are nearly six private security guards looking out for you as you work in your offices, shop in malls, eat in restaurants or simply stay at home. It is private security guards that ride with cash-filled vans to ATMs or to banks after collection from your neighbourhood mall. They guard jewellery stores, offices and vast manufacturing complexes such as Essar&rsquo;s Oil refinery in Gujarat or the BPO operations of TCS in Bengaluru. During 26/11, private security guards even worked with the National Security Guard on save-and-rescue missions inside Mumbai&rsquo;s Taj Mahal Hotel.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t come as a surprise then that the private security industry in India is poised for big-time growth. An estimated Rs 22,000 crore business, it&rsquo;s reportedly growing at 15-20% annually and Assocham expects it to cross Rs 40,000 crore by 2015. That&rsquo;s a more conservative estimate than the one by Frost &amp; Sullivan, which expects security spending &mdash; including homeland security and equipment bought by government agencies &mdash; to cross Rs 54,000 crore by 2016. That sounds plausible, considering the global private security industry is pegged at $200 billion, and growing at 14% every year. The US market accounts for 42% of that, followed by Western Europe at 26% and Asia Pacific at 12-13%. By 2015, India will have at least 4% share, making it among the top 10 markets for security.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Most agree that the industry has become more visible over the past decade &mdash; the result of terrorist attacks across India, the demand for security in new infrastructure projects such as airports, roads, ATMs and telecom towers and modern retail, hospitality and IT and ITeS services. &ldquo;Recent incidents have brought to the fore the grave gaps that exist in our security set-up, and the need for more participation from the private security industry,&rdquo; avers Neelu&nbsp;Khatri, head of aerospace, defence and security at KPMG&nbsp;India. And with the industry straddling several inflection points &mdash; doubling growth, consolidation and increased investor interest &mdash; the next few years promise to be very interesting for private security players.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Forward march</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The bulk of the private security industry (about 93%) comprises services such as manned guarding, electronic security-related services such as alarm monitoring, CCTVs, fire alarms systems and cash-in-transit services. The balance is accounted by equipment manufacturers such as Honeywell, Bosch and Siemens and specialised services such as detective investigation, employee verification and personal security (<em>see: Strength in numbers</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Strength in numbers- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The services part of the industry is largely unorganised and highly fragmented. There are close to 15,000 registered agencies in the country and many more unregistered ones that seem to spring up at the drop of a hat. Organised players, which account for about 25% of the sector, include a mix of domestic and international names such as G4S, which leads with 160,000 employees, Topsgrup (85,000), SIS (60,000), CMS Info Systems (25,000), ISS India (47,000) and Securitas India (20,000). In all, the sector employs an estimated 6 million people, mostly rural migrants aged between 19 and 35 years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Customers don''t want the headache of following statutory obligations while hiring private guards" - Rituraj Sinha, promoter, SIS India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Helping the industry become more structured is the Private Security Agency Regulation Act (PSARA) that came into force in 2005. The Act requires all agencies to be registered with respective controlling authorities in each state. For instance, in Gurgaon the police issues licenses, monitors private security and lays out guidelines for appointment and training of guards. &ldquo;Customers, too, are increasingly becoming more aware of brands and want certain standards to be followed. They do not want to take on the headache of following statutory obligations that come with hiring private guards,&rdquo; says Rituraj Sinha, promoter of Delhi-based SIS India, an 11-year-old firm with a revenue of Rs 2,500-crore. &ldquo;Working with credible organisations also means they do not have to deal with manpower-related issues,&rdquo; agrees Neil Prasad, regional managing director, G4S South Asia, the industry leader in man-guarding services. The biggest positive of a more organised industry is the growing interest among private equity players and foreign security firms, who are lining up for a share of the action.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Taking Guard</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Private equity firms already own many private security businesses globally. While Blackstone has a stake in US-based Allied Barton, Goldman along with EQT Partners, owns the world&rsquo;s largest private security firm, Denmark&rsquo;s International Security Systems (ISS); and GTCR Golden Rauner acquired Protection One in 2010 for $828 million.&nbsp;They have been steadily breaking into the Indian market since the mid 2000s, with the deal flow especially picking up in 2007-2011 period.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Some deals include the 2008 acquisition by Blackstone (along with former Microsoft India head Rajiv Kaul) of a majority stake in CMS group. CMS Info Systems, its cash management firm, in turn, acquired Securitrans India from APS Group in 2011 for Rs 250 crore. Goldman Sachs-backed ISS, too, acquired a 49% stake in SDB Cisco in August 2010 for Rs 150 crore. In all these cases, the foreign partner&rsquo;s share is capped at 49% due to government restrictions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Indian PE firms have also been active in the space during the past few years. ICICI Venture invested Rs 107 crore in Topsgrup in 2007. Topsgrup also has investments from Rakesh Jhunjhunwala&rsquo;s Rare Enterprises and Everstone Capital. DE Shaw invested Rs 50 crore in SIS for a 14% stake in 2008; it exited last year and now CX Partners is slated to invest Rs 200 crore in the business. &ldquo;The industry presents a lucrative opportunity and is in its early stage of consolidation. We have backed SIS as it shows a strong growth track record and we believe in the firm&rsquo;s management,&rdquo; says Ajay Relan, founder, CX Partners. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In the past seven years, there&rsquo;s also been a wave of M&amp;A activity in the security space. In December 2007, Sweden&rsquo;s Securitas acquired a 49% stake in Delhi-based Walson Security Services for Rs 67 crore. The following year, Topsgrup acquired Bengaluru&rsquo;s Guardwell Detective Services for Rs 20 crore. Some companies like Topsgrup and SIS have also acquired companies abroad. While SIS acquired Chubbs Security in Australia in 2008, Topsgrup completed the acquisition of UK-based Shield Security in 2012. Recently, the FIPB approved a proposal from UK-based OCS Group to acquire a stake in Central Investigation and Security Services, a Mumbai-based firm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The deal flow is likely to pick up speed this year. G4S has declared it is looking for acquisitions in India and West Asia. It bought DLF&rsquo;s TerraForce in 2009 for an unknown amount. &ldquo;We are open to acquiring companies if they offer value for money,&rdquo; says G4S&rsquo;s Prasad. Ramesh Iyer, CEO of the Rs 1,200-crore Topsgrup, is scouting for companies in India as is SIS&rsquo;s Sinha. Others like Checkmate Securities also have FIPB approval for raising #66 crore in foreign equity. As per news reports, the company is in talks with Standard Chartered PE for selling a 49% stake. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;I have the capital and I&rsquo;m always looking for acquisitions,&rdquo; says Rajiv Kaul, executive vice-chairman and chief executive of CMS Info Systems. The Rs 1,100-crore firm is a market leader in the cash-in-transit market and services around 32,000 ATMs across India. Kaul agrees the market is fragmented, but believes in the next five-six years, it will stabilise with three or four major players. &ldquo;Scale is the name of the game in cash-in-transit services. If you don&rsquo;t have volumes you cannot make money,&rdquo; he points out.</p>\n<p class="p3">Since most security firms tend to be localised operations, acquisitions are being done for just those reasons &mdash; gaining scale and geographical reach. With the Securitrans deal, CMS&rsquo; share of the cash management services market grew from 25% to the current 58%. Topsgrup&rsquo;s buyout of GuardWell, which had 5,000 employees in South India, helped it become the No. 2 player in the southern market after ISS.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Eye in the sky</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">As security needs and expectations increase, plain vanilla man-guarding is giving way to technology-enabled security services. In India, man-guarding accounts for 60% of the market but that&rsquo;s not the case in developed markets where the share is 46%. Now, security practices aided by electronic devices are gaining ground here as well &mdash; including sophisticated technologies such as biometric readers for fingerprints, voice and even iris scans. &ldquo;Many of our clients now want CCTVs and control rooms to monitor alarms,&rdquo; says Sinha. &ldquo;The idea in India, though, is not to replace guards but avoid human errors,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The biggest hurdle in the adoption of such technology has been price &mdash; the equipment is imported and the price tag reflects the additional cost. Now, local firms are stepping up to offer home-grown security solutions. Firms like Adit Security Systems, Zicom, Axis Technologies and Enkay Technologies offers equipment like CCTV surveillance, access and entrance control systems, biometric and whole host of fire detection and perimeter protection alarms. On average, these products are 30-40% cheaper than imported products.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;More and more people are opening up to adopting technologies such as fingerprint door-locks, video door-phones and alarms in both corporate and residential segments,&rdquo; says Pramod Rao, MD, Zicom, which has been operating in the electronic security equipment field since 1994. &ldquo;These products are picking up in even residential sector as costs have come down over time. Moreover, people are beginning to view security as a key need and priority.&rdquo; It becomes easier to adopt technology when there&rsquo;s a direct and visible impact on the bottomline. When it started the cash-in-transit business, CMS invested an undisclosed sum in setting up an IT network that gave it real-time information on money collected. Collectors were also given handheld devices to enter data in real time, minimising risk of fraud. &ldquo;Our IT systems enable us to raise red flags quickly and avoid losses for our clients and ourselves,&rdquo; says Kaul.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Our IT systems enable us to raise red flags quickly and avoid losses for our clients and ourselves" - Rajiv Kaul, CEO, CMS Info Systems</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Technology is only part of the story. Providing better trained staff and offering value-added services is fast becoming a differentiator. Topsgrup worked with a telecom sector client to set up a guard patrol-based security approach for its cell towers, rather than posting one guard at each tower. &ldquo;We trained these guards to perform basic functions at the towers like replacing batteries. This helped the client save 40-50% of security cost,&rdquo; says Iyer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We trained our guards to perform basic functions at the telecom towers. It saved 50% of the client''s security cost" - Ramesh Iyer, CEO, Topsgrup</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In any case, regular training is mandated by the PSARA, which calls for a minimum 160 hours of training at the entry level. Of this, 100 hours are in the classroom, learning about metal detectors, CCTV monitoring and unarmed combat, while the rest is on-the-job training. Bigger firms such as Topsgrup, SIS and G4S already have training facilities. SIS has 80 branches served by four regional training academies that churn out 15,000 guards a year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There&rsquo;s increased emphasis on the quality of training too. Delhi-based AP Securitas has tied up with Israel&rsquo;s ARES Group, which is run by former secret service and military officers and promises psychological profiling, polygraphy and &lsquo;reliability analysis&rsquo; to screen candidates. Many security training and education institutes have sprung up to offer diplomas and courses in security management. India Skills (a joint venture between Manipal Education and UK-based City &amp; Guilds) offers a diploma after 194 hours of training to equip guards with abilities like handling emergencies and operating disaster and security equipment. The International Institute of Security and Safety Management offers certificate courses in subjects like CCTV and visitor monitoring, hotel security, baggage scan and evacuation and managing hostage situations. &ldquo;Governments in states like Jharkhand have become interested in setting up such centres because of the employment potential for youth from rural areas,&rdquo; says Vikram Singh, chairman, Central Association of Private Security Industry. Better training will ensure better salaries and less exploitation, he feels. Currently, an entry level security guard makes Rs 7,000 a month, while those with English fluency or experience earn over Rs 9,000 and those trained in using firearms earn up to Rs 15,000 per month.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Obstacle course</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">But if there are opportunities across the spectrum, there are also many challenges. The biggest, of course, relates to the quality of talent. As Arjun Walia, promoter of Securitas India, says, &ldquo;You are only as good as your security guard. Well-trained guards are a company&rsquo;s best asset.&rdquo; Rural areas are the typical catchment area but few are employable, says Sinha. &ldquo;Lack of employable guards is the biggest constraint for the sector.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The uneven adoption of PSARA, which calls for mandatory training of guards, is also a hurdle. So far, only 10 states have passed the Act; in others, an overlap of regulators adds to the complication. For example, Maharashtra has a Security Guards Board but licenses are granted by the PSARA controlling authority and joint commissioner of police. &ldquo;One has to constantly shuttle between the two authorities,&rdquo; complains Iyer. In states that do not follow the minimum guidelines for hiring guards, private security agencies often get away with malpractices like not paying provident fund, hiring people with questionable integrity and deploying them without training.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Offense is the best defense - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Another concern relates to restrictions on arms carried by guards, especially for those engaged in the security of high-risk establishments. In November 2012, private security guards rode with cash vans to 103,000 ATMs across India and many more guarded bank ATMs, jewellery shops and fuel stations. The home ministry allows arms licenses to ex-servicemen to get employment as guards with banks and private establishments but private security agencies are not allowed to get an arms license for their security guards. &ldquo;We are slated to get [business for] another 100,000 ATMs by 2014 and that involves moving a lot of cash. It is only fair that arms be allowed,&rdquo; says Kaul. A Ficci study reports that the industry currently employs 30,000-50,000 gunmen. Since agencies are not permitted arms licences, they hire &lsquo;retainers&rsquo; &mdash; individuals who hold such permits. &ldquo;At times, the industry is forced to hire persons with questionable credentials just because they hold an arms licence. Agencies should be allowed to procure and use retainers along the same lines as banks,&rdquo; argues Sinha.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The good news for the industry is that these issues hardly come in the way of its growth. With more, industrial clusters, retail and hospitality developments, increase in terrorism and rising urban crime rates, the need for private security will only go up.

Ask SK Dutt, president and head-group HR, ABG Group. &ldquo;A few years ago, search firms used to be adamant about not cutting even 1% of their commission; now they are more open to negotiations,&rdquo; he says. He is, of course, talking about the changing attitudes of executive search firms over the past four to five years. Tough times &mdash; slowing revenue growth and the pressure to manage costs &mdash; have pushed Indian companies to take a long hard look at how cost-effective and accountable their search firm partners are.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">This is hardly surprising &mdash; hiring at the senior level is a highly monied affair and the cost of mis-hiring can be extremely expensive for an employer. &ldquo;A global study puts the total cost of mis-hires in the senior category at 26 times an executive&rsquo;s annual package,&rdquo; points out Ronesh Puri, managing director, Executive Access.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"A global study puts the total cost of mis-hires in the senior category at 26 times an executive''s annual package" - Ronesh Puri, MD, Executive Access</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Accordingly, established industry practices are beginning to change. Until now, the standard practice in global search has been to charge fees that amount to a third of a hired executive&rsquo;s annual package. This has begun to drop, with most leading firms such as ABC consultants and Hay Group now charging between 8-17% for mid-level hires. Even for C-suite searches, this fee is being lowered. &ldquo;We charge between 20-30% for such positions now,&rdquo; says Tulika Tripathi, India managing director at Michael Page, a global recruitment consultancy. Others from the industry agree that 25% is the new norm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Cash on delivery</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Typically, a search firm received a third of its total fees in advance when it got the mandate, another third when it shared profiles of potential candidates, and the balance after closure. If the candidate confirmed but did not join, the search firm still got to retain its fees. Now, companies are being careful, and many are switching to contingent hiring, where no fee is paid out before the position is closed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Even in retained search &mdash; usually for senior hires that require greater engagement with the search firm &mdash; hirers are building safeguards. Subramanian Suryanarayanan, national head, HR, Tata AIG General Insurance, says his firm has now switched to contingent searches for junior levels, while it continues with retained searches for CXO roles as is the industry norm. &ldquo;We work with select search firms and build covers to protect against monetary risk of non-closure,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Lower advance fees are another option offered by search firms to minimise client risk. &ldquo;We charge only 20% of the fee upfront and the rest is paid to us after closure,&rdquo; says Rajiv Burman, managing partner at Lighthouse Partners, a Delhi-based search firm. Some are willing to even engage on a &ldquo;rolling&rdquo; retained basis. &ldquo;If we have paid an advance and the candidate does not join, then we request the search firm to adjust this amount against a hire in future,&rdquo; says DCB Bank&rsquo;s group vice president for HR, Hamsaz Vasunia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Lighthouse charges only 20% of the fee upfront and the rest of it is paid to us after closure" - Rajeev Burman, MD, Lighthouse Partners</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">What if a candidate joins a new position but leaves soon after? While earlier, search firms would not agree with replacing the candidate free of cost or at a discount, now it is more or less a given. &ldquo;Such guarantees could go up to nine months in case of a CEO or between three to six months for CXO roles,&rdquo; says Bhavishya Sharma, director, Athena Executive Search &amp; Consulting. While most companies work with a loose agreement, some insist on formalising these terms. &ldquo;We have a strict six-month replacement clause, which is built into the contract. Search firms are held accountable and have to provide a free replacement&nbsp;to the satisfaction of the organisation or refund the amount paid by the company&nbsp;in case of non-closure within the agreed timeframe,&rdquo; says Suryanarayanan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Follow-up call</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Most search firms of course try to ensure such situations do not arise. Tripathi says her firm goes even beyond guarantees: &ldquo;We call regularly, enquire about [the candidate&rsquo;s] performance, and try to settle issues raised by the client,&rdquo; she says. A few are now also agreeing to link their fees to the candidate&rsquo;s performance on the job, though DCB Bank&rsquo;s Vasunia says there aren&rsquo;t many of them doing this yet. Yet others like Athena are using an innovative approach. &ldquo;For a recent placement for senior positions at a start-up firm, we took ESOPs as part payments linking us to the long-term growth of the company. For another client, the requirement was for a senior leader who could execute successfully and we would get a bonus if he did,&rdquo; says Sharma.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We call regularly, enquire about [the candidate''s] performance, and try to settle issues raised by the client" - India MD, Michael Page</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Search industry executives contend that while the demand for accountability and cost-effectiveness is fine, it needs to be tempered with the benefits they bring to the table. Athena&rsquo;s Sharma points out that the most common reason for a person leaving is not performance but culture.

(290, 16, '', 'Morning delight', '<p class="p1">The alarm pings seemingly hours before it&rsquo;s time to wake up. The children have to be shepherded to school, there&rsquo;s no time for gym and the lists of pending chores will stay pending another day because there&rsquo;s a meeting that&rsquo;s going to finish late in the evening. Is this what runs through your head in the morning? Yes! says Preeti Kumar, who works for a leading private bank in Bengaluru and commutes 22 km to work each way. She is health-conscious but her mornings are too frantic to warrant a &lsquo;proper breakfast&rsquo;. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s never enough time these days,&rdquo; sighs the 35-year-old who still rates <em>idli-chutney</em> as her favourite morning meal. &ldquo;So these days, we just have cereal. It&rsquo;s nutritious and convenient and there is a lot of variety.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Kumar is among the growing numbers of Indians who are driving the fast-exploding breakfast cereal market, valued by Euromonitor International at approximately Rs 870 crore in 2012, which Kellogg&rsquo;s leads with a market share of 57%. &ldquo;As compared with what we had in the 1990s, we are now in a very receptive market,&rdquo; says Aditya Bagri, general manager, marketing, of the Rs 45-crore Bagrry&rsquo;s India, a No.2 homegrown player with a 15.2% market share. &ldquo;It is no longer necessary to explain the health benefits [of breakfast cereals] because consumers are already aware. We also find that many younger people are willing to move away from heavier traditional breakfasts to cereals.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It wasn&rsquo;t always like this. Just ask Kellogg&rsquo;s. The American giant got off to a decidedly soggy start when it launched in India in 1994. A nation that was used to starting its mornings with a hot, savoury meal didn&rsquo;t warm up to the idea of a sweet breakfast with cold milk. It&rsquo;s taken the company the better part of the past 20 years to lead a market that&rsquo;s still minuscule compared with global markets. Still, there&rsquo;s finally an expanding, sustainable market for breakfast cereals with several big players including PepsiCo, Marico, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (GSKCH), Britannia and Dr Oetker Fun Foods. How did these companies finally find a recipe for success in this market?</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Breakfast power</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">First, a little background. The breakfast cereals market is divided into hot cereals (mostly oats, but also oat bran and wheat bran), and ready-to-eat (RTE) cold cereals (corn and wheat flakes, and muesli). Oats (the fastest growing segment of the Indian market) and muesli (next in growth) are not new products but have grown in popularity only in the past six-seven years. To some extent, of course, the market is self-propelled, thanks to higher spending power and hectic lifestyles. The other big reason is the widespread communication on health, especially on the escalating incidence of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and obesity in Indians. Not only are influencers such as doctors, nutritionists and the media passing on these messages, the companies diligently themselves play the health card in all their communication. &ldquo;New markets require companies to go to customers with powerful reasons to change, which is what these companies have done,&rdquo; says brand analyst Santosh Desai. &ldquo;The focus in the breakfast cereals market has been to highlight nutrition and create cultural familiarity with hot and spicy options.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Hardsell pays- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">It seems to be working. A five-year study first published in November 2011 by Euromonitor International, charts the growth of the breakfast cereals market from about Rs 222.4 crore in 2006 to Rs 751.5 crore in 2011, an energetic CAGR of 27.6%. And if you are wondering why oats is the new wunderkind on the market&rsquo;s menu, it&rsquo;s because the ravenous hot cereals segment grew by a CAGR of 47% in the same period. Note, this was on a smaller base of Rs 38.5 crore compared with the Rs 183.9 crore held by RTE cereals in 2006, which make up the rest of the cereal market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The penetration of packaged breakfasts [ready-to-cook <em>upma</em>, <em>poha</em>, <em>parantha </em>etc] is still negligible, even though brands like Britannia&rsquo;s Healthy Start and Quaker&rsquo;s Nutri-poha and Nutri-upma are attempting to pitch them alongside breakfast cereals. Instead, the real action is in oats and cold cereals. In fact, the Euromonitor report predicts that the breakfast cereals market will grow by a CAGR of 16% between 2011 and 2016, rising to Rs 1,565.20 crore, with hot cereals at about Rs 829.54 crore and RTE cereals at Rs 735.60 crore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>Go with the grain</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">If there&rsquo;s ever been a clear case of supply-led demand, it&rsquo;s probably the breakfast oats market. For the longest time, Bagrry&rsquo;s was the only &ldquo;name&rdquo; in the oats market. Then, PepsiCo rolled out Quaker Oats in 2006 and by 2011, companies such as Marico, GSKCH and Britannia had all launched their own versions. &ldquo;The oats category has been a bit commoditised, but Horlicks Oats has been building its consumer franchise profitably,&rdquo; reveals Soumava Sengupta, GM, foods, GSKCH. Horlicks Oats was launched in November 2011 and Sengupta says the product accounts for 10% of the GSKCH foods portfolio. Different pack sizes and a brand promise of nourishment have been the main planks of GSKCH&rsquo;s marketing for oats.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Where Horlicks has stuck to plain oats, Marico has grown its Saffola Oats to become the No.2 player in breakfast oats (after Quaker) by offering variety. Sameer Satpathy, executive vice-president and marketing head of the consumer products business at Marico, points out that one hurdle in the acceptance of oats was the taste (or rather, the lack of it). Admit it, plain oats tastes like the horse&rsquo;s food it was originally grown for. &ldquo;The consumer sees health and taste at the opposite ends of the spectrum. Growth can be unlocked only if this trade-off is minimised,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;So, the research and development team at Marico was given a simple brief: how can we make oats not just acceptable but one that can be relished?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Consumers see health and taste as opposites. Growth can be unlocked only if this trade-off is minimised" - Sameer Satpathy, executive VP, consumer products, Marico</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">It wasn&rsquo;t easy getting the flavour right for the spiced oats, though &mdash; incidentally, Marico was the first to launch flavoured oats in India. &ldquo;Preferences change every 200 km and arriving at taste preferences that will be liked everywhere, without which the supply chain becomes inefficient, is a particularly interesting challenge,&rdquo; says Satpathy. Marico&rsquo;s solution: six flavours catering to regional preferences.</p>\n<p class="p3">Marico&rsquo;s success owes a lot to an insight on Indian consumers &mdash; the preference for savoury over sweet options at breakfast. Check the aisles of any supermarket in the US or Europe and you&rsquo;ll find oatmeal variants such as maple sugar, cinnamon, honey and various fruit flavours. In India, even Quaker &mdash; which has no savoury flavours in the US, its biggest market &mdash; has launched &ldquo;lemon-veggie&rdquo; and &ldquo;homestyle masala&rdquo; options. And, while it hasn&rsquo;t let go of its sweet tooth, the flavours have a distinctly Indian feel &mdash; strawberry-apple and <em>kesar-kishmish</em>. &ldquo;Flavours have to align with the habits and every day life of consumers,&rdquo; says brand analyst Desai. &ldquo;So, to get the flavours right, brands have to keep old habits in mind even as they try to create new ones.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">The potential of the oats segment has spared no one, not even the leader in the breakfast cereals market. &ldquo;We launched Kellogg&rsquo;s Heart-to-Heart Oats to participate in the exploding oats category,&rdquo; confirms Kellogg&rsquo;s India&rsquo;s managing director, Sangeeta Pendurkar. India is the only market where the king of cold cereals has stepped into the ready-to-cook category. It&rsquo;s not the first time Kellogg&rsquo;s has tailored its offering to suit the local market here.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>On second try&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Kellogg&rsquo;s entry into India was almost an exercise in how not to launch a brand. Not enough products, not enough stores, exorbitant prices, alien tastes ignored&hellip; the list goes on. &ldquo;The products were not marketed for good taste as they are in the US, but instead for health reasons,&rdquo; adds Deborah Cross, food industry analyst and packaged food expert at Euromonitor International. &ldquo;They assumed there was a gap in the market for premium brand products, so introduced only three corn flakes brands, only in premium outlets. Many consumers either had no access to, or could not afford the Kellogg&rsquo;s products. They did not do much due diligence and market research on the Indian market until several years after they entered it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Once the research was done, Kellogg&rsquo;s slowly started tweaking its India strategy. It expanded its offering to include locally popular flavours such as mango, banana and strawberry. In parallel it paid equal attention to children, virtually creating the children&rsquo;s cereal market with products such as Chocos and Honey Loops. Pricing was an issue &mdash; at the time of launch, Kellogg&rsquo;s basic corn flakes was considerably more expensive than then-market leader Mohun&rsquo;s. In 2006, the company came up with single-serve packs priced at Rs 10; unit for unit, it was still costlier than Mohun&rsquo;s but the packs were aggressively promoted as an after-school and early evening snack. &ldquo;We have assimilated a lot of data on breakfast habits across the country,&rdquo; says Pendurkar. &ldquo;Rather than a purely demographic segmentation, adults and children are equal opportunity markets for us and we are building the segments simultaneously.&rdquo; She declines to say whether the company is in the black or not, nor does she confirm the company&rsquo;s filing with the RoC, that shows sales of Rs 301 crore and a profit of Rs 9 crore for FY11.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Rather than a purely demographic segmentation, adults and children are equal opportunity markets for us" - Sangeeta Pendurkar, managing director, Kellogg''s India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">As the current head of a patient player who had to wait for nearly two decades before the market took off, Kellogg&rsquo;s Pendurkar feels, &ldquo;there is no formula for the waiting period&rdquo;. Any change of habit is a long-haul game and there are too many variables &mdash; consumer needs and investment by the organisation, among others &mdash; to arrive at a formulaic result. Still, once it realised it was on the wrong track, Kellogg&rsquo;s followed a conventional blueprint, checking all the right boxes when it came down to product, price and promotion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>Everyone wants a bite</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Indeed, one reason for the growth in the breakfast cereals market is the determined marketing efforts of the various players. Kellogg&rsquo;s is perhaps the most visible, thanks to its celebrity endorsements but others are also ensuring their brands are seen and remembered, especially at the point of sale. Saffola, for instance, has gone national with its oats variants only in the past year, while its muesli was launched in August 2012. Since it soft launched the masala oats in South India, the marketing efforts &mdash; including on-ground activations with local celebrity chefs, festival-themed cooking shows, trial packs, in-store promotions &mdash; were concentrated in that region. Similarly, with its early-mover advantage, Quaker Oats had close to four years to establish its presence before other big players stepped into the breakfast oats space. It did this with traditional TV and print ads, as well as online. Apart from the usual social media presence, the company also created Good Morning Heart, which offered health diagnostics, healthy cooking and fitness tips, and advice from nutrition specialists and dieticians. In 2009, it started the &ldquo;mission to make India heart healthy&rdquo; in collaboration with Apollo Hospitals, Chennai police and some corporate houses, where it offered an online health check-up and personalised diet counselling by nutritionists. Two years later, it followed up with the Smart Heart Challenge that invited employees with high risk of heart disease to change their eating habits, work out and de-stress daily, and have their cholesterol checked at Apollo Clinics, all for free. &ldquo;Oats is still a nascent category in India, but the fastest growing within the breakfast segment,&rdquo; says a PepsiCo&nbsp; spokesperson. &ldquo;We are investing heavily to educate the consumer.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Over the years, Kellogg&rsquo;s too has pumped in serious sums of money into marketing activities in India. It is a regular advertiser on television and in print and has signed on celebrity brand ambassadors for its various products.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Not surprisingly, local players find it difficult to match the marketing muscle of the big multinationals. Bagrry&rsquo;s, for instance, does virtually no advertising, instead it is focusing on improving its distribution network &mdash; it&rsquo;s already available in over 130 cities and towns across India, Nepal and Bhutan. But Bagri isn&rsquo;t complaining about the advertising onslaught.&ldquo;The multinationals have opened up the category and built awareness, which is a plus,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;So the competition here is more a marketing opportunity than a negative.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The multinationals have opened up the [cereal] category and built awareness, which is a plus" - Aditya Bagri, general manager, marketing, Bagrry''s</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Certainly, another small player, the Mumbai-based Express Foods, is cashing in on the growing popularity of muesli by offering something more than just a box of cereal (even though the company does that with eight variants under the Harvest Crunch brand). In late 2011, it launched the Express Foods Cereal Bar at an upmarket department store in south Mumbai; there are now five such cereal bars across Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi. Here, customers can make their own muesli mixture, choosing from premium ingredients such as cranberries, blackcurrants, Belgian chocolate chips and Californian almonds. &ldquo;Customers like the concept because of the customisation possibilities,&rdquo; points out C Jaikishan, director, Express Foods. &ldquo;Not having the financial resources to compete with the advertising budgets of the Goliaths means our products are our brand ambassadors,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Will all this frenetic activity ensure that the market continues to remain charged up? Analysts believe that while the overall market will certainly grow, there could be a shuffling of marketshare &mdash; Kellogg&rsquo;s leads the pack currently but will have to work harder to remain on top. &ldquo;Most of the innovation in breakfast cereals within the last few years has been in hot cereals and muesli, and Kellogg&rsquo;s mainly offers RTE flakes,&rdquo; explains Euromonitor&rsquo;s Cross. &ldquo;Hot cereals trend more with the traditional tastes of Indian consumers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Internationally, the breakfast cereals market is mature, even ageing, with multiple formats, flavours and pack sizes. In India, as Marico&rsquo;s Satpathy points out, &ldquo;penetration is low and so is the frequency at which breakfast cereals are consumed.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, then, is a market that is only just waking up.&nbsp;</p>', 'Breakfast cereal makers are finally succeeding in turning a cold market into a hot opportunity ', '34,35', '', 0, '', 'morning-delight-290', 285, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Morning delight', 'Breakfast cereal makers are finally succeeding in turning a cold market into a hot opportunity ', '', '', '', 'Breakfast cereal,Kellogg''s,Bagrry''s India,Quaker Oats,Saffola', 0, NULL, '2015-01-28 17:47:33', '2015-01-28 18:12:18', '2013-04-13', 0),

While no dramatic uptick is expected in the first quarter of the new financial year, some analysts believe earnings should start improving from the second quarter and that FY14, overall, will be much better than FY13. Much of this hope is driven by an expected fall in inflation and further easing by the central bank. Among the believers is Abhay Laijawala, director, research, Deutsche Equities India. He thinks the low earnings cycle will bottom out and an upswing will kick in from the second quarter of FY14. He says, &ldquo;We expect GDP to grow at 6.5% for FY14 from the 5% projected this year and believe interest rates will be pared by 100 basis points.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">That said, the biggest bugbear that the government has to deal with is the current account deficit. What are the chances of it playing spoilsport via a depreciating rupee. Though a weak rupee certainly benefits software and export oriented companies, it means expensive crude and increased input costs for companies that are import dependent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Laijawala believes it should not be a problem. &ldquo;The worst should be over as far as the current account deficit is concerned, as will be reflected in the December export numbers. Gold prices too could taper off due to the government&rsquo;s efforts to restrict gold imports. All this will have an impact from Q2 onwards,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">If this sunny scenario works out, companies could certainly gain from a revival in investment and consumer spending. Companies operating in the cement, auto and capital goods have taken it on the chin and could be the first to benefit.

After all, none other than a committee headed by C Rangarajan had made the recommendation in October 2012.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Politics and economics, however, make for strange bedfellows. While sugar producers may be right in demanding partial or full decontrol, the government has its own compulsions to deal with. Prime among them is the currently high CPI (10.91%), to which rising food prices are the biggest contributor. Given the double-digit inflation, there isn&rsquo;t much room for higher sugar prices that would have resulted if levy sugar was abolished. Under the levy sugar system, sugar mills sell 10% of their production at Rs 19 a kg to the government. In case the levy is abolished, not only will there be a high subsidy to be provided for, there will be knock-on effect on food inflation too. &ldquo;If removal of sales at levy price is implemented, the government will have to procure sugar at market price (Rs 32) to meet its PDS requirements, thus relieving the industry of an annual loss of #3,000 crore,&rdquo; says Sanjay Manyal, analyst, ICICI Direct.</p>\n<p class="p3">As the government has not been reimbursing sugar companies on time, they fund their working capital via debt. On their part, they also delay paying farmers for cane. High cane prices have ensured that farmers have benefited but companies have lost out.

This postponement has resulted in a meltdown in sugar stocks.

So, are there any bargains to be found here? IIFL analyst Bhavesh Gandhi says, &ldquo;Post-deregulation one can buy Balrampur Chini, but other than that it&rsquo;s better to avoid the sector.&rdquo; Manyal, too, recommends Balrampur Chini and Dhampur Sugar as they have relatively lighter balance sheets compared with Renuka Sugar or Bajaj Hindusthan.

How else would one explain the performance of its stock price, which was up 60% last year, and has corrected more than 20% since its recent high in November 2012?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Titan has been a darling of the stock markets, admired both for its governance and performance track record. Over the past five years, as its overall revenues and profits grew 31% and 41% respectively, its market-cap multiplied eight-fold. But that glitter seems to be wearing off now. Ironically, the same factors that contributed to its growth so far are posing a challenge now.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The undisputed star in Titan&rsquo;s portfolio, Tanishq brings in more than 80% of overall revenues through 176 stores that sell gold and diamond studded jewellery. It&rsquo;s a bet that clearly paid off for Titan when it entered this space. Launched against wide scepticism in 1994, the jewellery business gradually made its mark, growing by 36% in the past five years alone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In 2012, though, some of the sheen had begun to wear off. Same store sales (sales from stores that have been in operation for at least one year; also called &lsquo;like-to-like (LTL) sales&rsquo;) rose by a modest 8-10% over the past three quarters of FY13, compared to 25% in the preceding three quarters. This was the lowest growth rate among all of Titan&rsquo;s product lines. But it had little to do with the company&rsquo;s operating philosophy or even its strategy, which has served it well for nearly two decades. All-time high prices of gold were in fact to blame, and these deterred buyers from flocking to jewellery stores. That was a hard blow in an economy singed by inflation and mired in uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Party Spoiler</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">It is no secret that Indians love their gold. Festive splurges, wedding season sales and the security of gold as an investment asset make it the country&rsquo;s second-largest imported item, after crude oil. In FY12, India imported $56.5 billion worth of the precious metal, up 50% from the previous year. As gold imports increased further this fiscal, making up nearly half of the current account deficit, the government decided to curb gold imports by hiking the customs duty from 4% to 6% in January this year to control the deficit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While that did set in fresh concerns over waning demand for jewellery, there are greater worries related to two key proposals by the RBI. If implemented, these will not only increase financing costs for the company but also impact its working capital. The first recommendation to link gold leasing rate to the base rate would push gold leasing rates up from the present 3.5% to 8-10%. Under a lease arrangement, the buyer &mdash; in this case, Titan &mdash; pays rent on gold till it is consumed. The gold contracts are closed at the time of product sale and not at the time of purchase. This way, no inventory is carried, avoiding any mark-to-market loss or gains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Not as glittering- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Titan, which is the only company allowed to import gold directly &mdash; apart from banks and state-owned firms &mdash; shifted most of its procurements to local banks after RBI cut the lease period from 180 days to 90 days for gold procured through state-owned firms such as Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation (MMTC) and State Trading Corporation (STC). But now, RBI has proposed to cut the leasing period for banks too. Titan has been in talks with the authorities to maintain status-quo, but it is unclear whether the central bank will oblige.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Analysts say that a longer lease period is vital for Titan as it takes around 120 days to sell the leased gold and pay back the banks or state-owned firms. At 90 days, it would have to pay for unsold gold as well, which could impact not just its working capital and cash flows but expose it further to volatility in gold prices. Global investment bank Jefferies estimates that the impact of an increase in gold lease rates and decrease in lease period on Titan&rsquo;s earnings could be as much as 11%. In such a case, the company&rsquo;s management has indicated that it would go for direct imports where it can at least improve on margins.</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Silver lining</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">All this won&rsquo;t amount to much till consumers start buying again. &ldquo;Unless there is an improvement in overall sentiment, gold demand is unlikely to recover sharply,&rdquo; says Gautam Duggad, vice-president, Motilal Oswal. An uptick just might be around the corner and the upcoming wedding season should bring in some cheer for Titan and others in the business.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Unless, of course, the proposed amendment to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act kicks in sooner. The amendment, which extends know your customer (KYC) details to a larger universe of gold buyers, will require retailers to furnish PAN for purchases above Rs 50,000. Presently, KYC details are mandatory only for customers who buy gold worth over #5 lakh. It&rsquo;s unlikely though, as a recent Morgan Stanley report indicates, that this amendment will apply only to bullion and precious gems and may not include jewellery retail.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Performance pressure- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Then again, given its market leader position in the organised jewellery retail space (5% share), investors could do well to cut it some slack. It has taken quite a while for the watchmaker to build a respected brand in the jewellery market, estimated at Rs 135,000 crore. In a business where unorganised and family-owned jewellers dominate with nearly 90% share, Titan&rsquo;s competitive strengths and consumer focus earns praise from brand consultant Harish Bijoor. &ldquo;Titan does not give customers what they want today. They are always one step ahead and offer customers what they will need tomorrow,&rdquo; he says. He points to the company&rsquo;s latest brand, Mia, aimed at the working woman, where it&rsquo;s addressing what promises to be a big market in the coming years. The fact that consumers have been shifting from local jewellers to national chains as they become more discerning about quality and design, augurs well for Titan too.</p>\n<p class="p3">It fits in with the strategic shift that Titan has been grappling with for some time now. The watch business defined brand Titan until some time ago. Today, watches contribute less than one-fifth to total revenues, and price hikes to pass on increased input costs have reduced volume growth. So, even as revenues grew by 13% in the first nine months of FY13, volume growth for the watch business has been rather modest at 2%. &ldquo;Watches are becoming more a part of consumers&rsquo; discretionary spend rather than a necessity,&rdquo; says Abneesh Roy, associate director, Edelweiss Securities. &ldquo;Most people have mobile phones, which now double up as their watch.&rdquo; No wonder, Titan is looking to expand the sales network of its high-end brand Helios. There are currently 41 stores and the company is looking to add another 100 in two-three years. The Helios stores also house 25 international brands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Titan&rsquo;s other businesses &mdash; engineering and eyewear &mdash; bring in about 4% revenues. Titan Eye+ has emerged as the largest retail eyewear chain in India with 215 stores, and revenues from eyewear have grown by 10% in the first nine months of FY13. Analysts are more excited about the Fastrack brand where the company retails fashion accessories like bags, belts and wallets. Titan plans to include more categories like helmets in the near term and target the kids market through the Zoop brand.</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Standing tall</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">For now, jewellery is the star to watch out for. While a 10-year bull run since 2002 saw a CAGR of nearly 20% in gold prices, Titan&rsquo;s jewellery business model has never been tested in a situation like now. Its management track record, so far, offers some comfort. While the new store expansion that the company undertook in FY13 will lead to higher operating costs, analysts concede that in a full year of operation these showrooms will augment the company&rsquo;s revenue growth. The company is expected to post revenue growth of 21-22%, earnings growth of 23-24% and an operating margin of 9.5% in FY14. Analysts also expect the company and its peers to pass any increase in costs to consumers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Store expansion has been measured, though. During the first nine months of FY13, of the targeted space addition of 200,000 sq ft in its jewellery business, Titan added 110,000 sq ft, and is looking to close the year with 150,000 sq ft added. According to analysts, the company has indicated that the balance will be added in the June 2013 quarter. &ldquo;Retail store expansion is a very critical part of strategy because same store growth has been a challenge,&rdquo; says Edelweiss&rsquo; Roy. &ldquo;The only way to prop up growth has been through new store expansion as it helps in gaining market share from unorganised players.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Titan isn&rsquo;t the only one. All leading jewellers including Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri and PC Jeweller are looking to add new stores to grow sales. Kerala-based Kalyan Jewellers has opened three showrooms of 15,000 sq ft each, in Mumbai recently. &ldquo;Cannibalisation and competition are issues we shouldn&rsquo;t ignore,&rdquo; caution Citigroup analysts Aditya Mathur and Jamshed Dadabhoy in their report on Indian retail jewellery. They say that increased competition is the reason Titan&rsquo;s revenue growth, despite a 25% retail space addition, was only 14% on a y-o-y basis, during the first nine months of FY13.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">If the new regulations on gold imports come through, Morgan Stanley estimates that Titan&rsquo;s return on capital employed, which stood at 63% at the end of FY12, could be hit by 15%. What&rsquo;s encouraging is that Titan is expected to generate free cash flow of more than Rs 875 crore in FY13, which should help fund its increased working capital needs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala must be seeking comfort in the cash being generated, for he recently added 71,000 shares, increasing his stake to 10.31%. At its current price of Rs 245, the stock trades at 24.5 times its estimated FY14 earnings. That&rsquo;s lower than its 10-year forward average multiple of 26 times. But remember that the high forward multiple was a function of high expected growth, which is in question now. So, what should you do? The stock has support around the Rs 220 level. Therefore, one needs to&nbsp; watch out for this level. If it holds in the days to come, go ahead rekindle the romance. If not, then wait it out.&nbsp;</p>', 'Titan''s scorching growth in the jewellery business has hit a speedbreaker, but it is doing all it can to get back on the fast track', '6', '', 0, '', 'missing-bustle-294', 289, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Missing bustle', 'Titan''s scorching growth in the jewellery business has hit a speedbreaker, but it is doing all it can to get back on the fast track', '', '', '', 'Titan industries,Tanishq,Gold jewellery,Titan Eye+,Fastrack', 0, NULL, '2015-01-28 18:29:08', '2015-01-28 18:45:44', '2013-04-13', 0),

(296, 24, '', 'Pairing it right', '<p class="p1">Ernest Hemingway famously wrote about wine in Europe being &ldquo;something as healthy and normal as food, and also as a great giver of happiness and well-being and delight&rdquo;. Chandigarh-based Yashovardhan Saboo, who runs Ethos, India&rsquo;s largest retail chain of Swiss-made watches, agrees heartily with the description. His love for the drink that came to be associated with sophistication, even snobbish attitudes, began from reading authors like Hemingway and F Scott Fitzgerald, whose references to wine (and the consumption of it) informed their depiction of early 19th century European culture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It wasn&rsquo;t until he was 24, though &mdash; during his first trip to Europe &mdash;that Saboo was able to quench his curiosity. He learned to enjoy and appreciate the finer aspects of wine much later, entertaining overseas customers. &ldquo;While dealing with foreign clients, you can either connect using food or alcohol. As vegetarian, I thought wine was a better way,&rdquo; says the managing director of KDDL, which is into high-end watch components and precision engineering solutions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Saboo recalls the crisp winter&rsquo;s day in Basel when a friend took him to a blind tasting session. It involved tasting and sorting wines into three categories &mdash; ordinary, good and great &mdash; without knowing the brand. Noting the reactions of the 20-odd participants who obviously knew their stuff, he was surprised to find that his assessment was pretty close to theirs. &ldquo;Even if you aren&rsquo;t familiar with wines, it is quite easy to differentiate the great ones from the simple ones when you focus,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Wines of same vintage or year could taste different even if opened at the same time, depending on how they were stored. &ldquo;Every bottle you open is like a blind date. There is a lot of anticipation and you never know what it will be like. So, I can&rsquo;t stick to one; I need to keep trying and exploring,&rdquo; says Saboo. His favourite among Indian wines is the Grover La Reserve, though he thinks it&rsquo;s not as good as it was 10 years ago. &ldquo;I like wines from Bordeaux and Burgundy [France], Piedmont [Italy], Napa Valley [USA] and the Priorat region [Spain] the most.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In 2003, a chance conversation with a member of the Delhi Wine Club encouraged Saboo to launch one in his city. Now, the Chandigarh Wine Club hosts blind tastings and dinners for its 50 members about four to five times a year. Those travelling abroad share their latest discoveries, acquisitions and experiences with wine, upon their return. Sometimes, experts are called in to conduct tasting sessions and introduce wines.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">So, what does a vegetarian like Saboo pair his wine with? Cheese always works &mdash; especially a range of hard cheese, like <em>parmigiano reggiano</em>, goes well with Tannic wines for him. For someone who isn&rsquo;t sure how to pick the perfect cheese for their drink, Saboo suggests this golden rule, &ldquo;Coupling cheese and wine from the same region is always a good option.&rdquo; Other than that, pasta, moderately-spiced food, and anything <em>tandoori</em> go down equally well. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about how you like it, and not what experts tell you to like, or brands that are trendy,&rdquo; he concludes.&nbsp;</p>', 'A deep interest in wine naturally complements Yashovardhan Saboo''s business interests in expensive Swiss watches', '27', '', 0, '', 'pairing-it-right-296', 291, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Pairing it right', 'A deep interest in wine naturally complements Yashovardhan Saboo''s business interests in expensive Swiss watches', '', '', '', 'Yashovardhan Saboo,Ethos,Wine', 0, NULL, '2015-01-28 18:50:49', '2015-01-28 18:54:31', '2013-04-13', 0),

A trade surplus country till 1956, it was turned into a massive trade deficit nation. The regressive licence-permit regime used the Monopolies Act and Industries Act to severely restrict growth and operations of the private sector. Yet, ingenious Indian businessmen found ways to grow both at home and abroad through the political and bureaucratic atmosphere of suspicion and distrust. But there is hardly any reliable account of the bumpy ride that some of the successful and other less fortunate Indian multinationals and their entrepreneurs had to go through under those trying circumstances. Most Indian business books read like poor PR handouts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Eminent business journalist Parthasarathi Swami&rsquo;s <em>Boar in Boots</em> is probably the first attempt by any researcher and author to pen the pleasure and pangs of those new generation of business explorers &mdash; suddenly exposed to a highly competitive environment after the government had to belatedly opt for capitalist economic reform &mdash; as they attempted to make their mark at home and abroad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The story of Chennai-born, Shanghai-based caterer M Antony&rsquo;s rise as the richest Indian in China is on a completely different plane compared with Infosys Technologies (China) CEO Rangarajan Vellamore&rsquo;s unique effort to make the wholly-owned Indian enterprise a rare success.

(298, 24, '', 'A Zegna for fashion', '<p class="p1">There&rsquo;s something forbidding about the name of a fashion house that doesn&rsquo;t trip off the tongue with the felicity of a Dolce Gabbana. And while it could have gone with simply Zegna (pronounced like the flower zinnia, which is currently in full bloom in Delhi), the full throated Ermenegildo Zegna is a bit of a tongue-tripper. That it offers only menswear and has been associated with formal clothing that implies a corporate look, and with CEOs usually professing to wearing brands such as Hugo Boss and Armani, you might wonder what&rsquo;s in store for the Indian male straying into a Zegna store.</p>\n<p class="p3">I didn&rsquo;t have to do even that to gain an insight into how the 100-year-old brand is managing its Indian business. Zegna has been around in Delhi and Mumbai longer than we realise and with a growing footprint around the world, its collection is becoming increasingly &ldquo;trans-seasonal&rdquo;, according to country manager Luca Giovine. And that&rsquo;s less of an oxymoron, when one considers that brands across continents are investing in materials and trends that defy geographies and climates, thanks largely, as Giovine points out, &ldquo;to airconditioned environments&rdquo;. The result is fashion that migrates easily across seasons, which is important, &ldquo;since our customers are travellers who want the same things that are in trend at the same time in New Zealand as in London&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Actually, that&rsquo;s a challenge that isn&rsquo;t pertinent to Zegna alone as fashion houses grapple with &ldquo;moods, colours, but mostly materials&rdquo; across trends to arrive at a signature look that will find takers globally. As fashion gets edgier, it must become more &ldquo;mass&rdquo;, something that goes beyond the slate and charcoal look associated with corporatewear. For Zegna, that change has been heralded with its choice of lightweight silks replacing the more usual linen so that its dedication to luxury fabrics remains undiluted. Woven in a manner that &ldquo;allows the fabric to breathe well in Mumbai weather&rdquo;, it remains to be seen whether it will work as efficiently in Delhi &mdash; where the extreme summer heat makes anything other than cotton or linen impossible to wear &mdash; but which is potentially a larger market for the brand than Mumbai.</p>\n<p class="p3">Whether the current colours or materials find favour in India in general is less important since a significant segment of the market here is made up of Zegna&rsquo;s &ldquo;made-to-measure&rdquo; business, with buyers preferring bespoke fittings and, presumably, choice of materials and colours. Buying off the shelf might be &lsquo;cheaper&rsquo; than customisation, but Zegna&rsquo;s customers are buying into its &ldquo;top quality casual wear&rdquo; for everyday office and clubbing, reserving traditional winter clothing for overseas travel. Even then, they&rsquo;re moving away from customary heavy fabrics since they&rsquo;re unlikely to be tramping around the pavements of Davos or Manhattan as they move from one heated venue to another. As fashion becomes less dependent on seasons, one can only wonder if that&rsquo;s a good thing &mdash; or bad. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>&mdash;The author is a Delhi-based&nbsp;writer and curator</strong></p>', 'Customised menswear and trans-seasonal casuals define the summer trend of 2013', '17', '', 0, '', 'a-zegna-for-fashion-298', 293, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'A Zegna for fashion', 'Customised menswear and trans-seasonal casuals define the summer trend of 2013', '', '', '', 'Ermenegildo Zegna,Menswear', 0, NULL, '2015-01-28 19:22:58', '2015-01-28 19:25:42', '2013-04-13', 0),

(301, 12, '', 'A creative bent of mind', '<p class="p1"><span class="s1">R</span>ajiv Jayaraman had a set schedule in California a decade ago. The 24-year-old would spend the week at Oracle, focusing on patents and products. Weekends were reserved for theatre: he was part of a troupe that performed plays for charitable organisations. It was a happy balance: while patents gave him the thrill of creation, they took years to turn into products; acting, on the other hand, was all about living in the moment. But somewhere between plays and patents, the entrepreneurial bug bit Jayaraman. &ldquo;That is when I thought of doing something at the intersection of technology and story-telling,&rdquo; recalls Jayaraman, the 34-year-old founder-CEO of Knolskape.</p>\n<p class="p2">The five-year-old Knolskape does just that, creating simulation-based products for managers and B-school students. With the basic idea that it&rsquo;s easier to learn by doing, the company has developed off-the-shelf as well as customised virtual learning tools and experiential learning products for clients such as Standard Chartered Bank, Mindtree, Cognizant, Volvo and L&amp;T Infotech, as well as leading B-schools such as Kellogg, National University of Singapore, Indian School of Business and Insead. &ldquo;This is story-telling where the protagonist is also the learner,&rdquo; says Jayaraman, whose company started making profits from its second year of operations and is expected to clock revenue of #3 crore by June 2013.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>An entrepreneurial education</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">For someone with a creative bent of mind, Jayaraman&rsquo;s foray into entrepreneurship began on a conventional note: he enrolled for an MBA at Insead with a vague idea of &ldquo;later&rdquo; getting into animation. It was to be a life-changing decision. For a subject in human resources, he was assigned a simulation product. &ldquo;For the first time, I was not sitting in a lecture. I was doing things and seeing their impact immediately. That was my a-ha moment,&rdquo; says Jayaraman.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Knolskape - Element</strong></p>\n<p class="p6"><span class="s2">As it happened, Insead offered only that one simulation-based learning, whereas he saw potential for extending the concept. &ldquo;I started looking at other subjects where one could</span> learn through experience and the foundation of Knolskape was laid.&rdquo; The timing couldn&rsquo;t have been worse &mdash; Jayaraman graduated in 2008, when the global economy was on the verge of collapse. Instead of setting out completely on his own, therefore, he set up Knolskape &mdash; a portmanteau of &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; and &ldquo;landscape&rdquo; &mdash; at Insead in Singapore. While Insead paid Rs 35 lakh for the work the company did in the first year and provided office space, Knolskape bootstrapped itself for four years.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">In the first year, Jayaraman and his eight-member team worked on getting their product strategy right, creating products for Insead and other educational institutions. As Knolskape focused on enriching management curriculum, institutions such as ISB and Kellogg soon signed on as clients. &ldquo;Since we started through Insead, many doors opened for us,&rdquo; he says. Indeed, the company&rsquo;s grown so far entirely through word of mouth.&nbsp; By year two, when Knolskape had an independent office, corporate clients too came on board. Now, the company has about 25 clients, including B-schools and corporates, across South East and West Asia and the US.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7">&nbsp;<strong>Role playing</strong></p>\n<p class="p9">So, how do Knolskape&rsquo;s products work? It&rsquo;s fairly simple. The cloud-based products allow a user to log in and participate in any simulation-based case study. In a simulation for soft skills training, for instance, two animated characters could be in conversation. When the student intervenes and adds his observations/ comments, the conversation changes and becomes dynamic &mdash; every wrong option will take the learner to a dead-end. Another simulation for pricing strategy has the participant play the role of pricing director in an airline. As the student takes decisions on fares, the simulation is equipped with events that affect a customer&rsquo;s choice of airline; it also offers insights on effective capacity utilisation and the impact of the decisions on profitability and the competitive landscape.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p9"><strong>Fun at work- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">Different products are available for various management areas such as leadership, IT, HR and sales. Balagopal Vissa, associate professor of entrepreneurship at Insead, says a part of his research was on the networking style of entrepreneurs. Knolskape helped him develop a tool to analyse a participant&rsquo;s behaviour and networking style. &ldquo;It brings concepts to life and it is so much easier to demonstrate through experience,&rdquo; he says. The IP for this tool is with Vissa while Insead bore the costs of developing it.</p>\n<p class="p6">While the initial ideas were developed in association with Insead faculty, Knolskape has built its own product development capability and is now also customising content for clients. For instance, if a team within a company wins a big contract, Knolskape can turn their strategy and approach into a simulation-based case study for others in the organisation. Goals, functions, roles etc., can all be modified depending on the business requirements and international versions created for global customers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">Knolskape is also setting up on-campus simulation labs to give students greater access to its products. Five B-schools in Bengaluru have already signed on for a subscription model where students will pay Rs 500-700 per session. Jayaraman declines to name the institutions as the contracts are yet to be signed. &ldquo;Pilots are trained in flight simulators and surgeons on cadavers. But managers take decisions without understanding their impact on the company or customers. We want managers to learn the art of prediction instead of passive thinking,&rdquo; says Jayaraman.</p>\n<p class="p6">The revenue model, too, is straightforward &mdash; the company charges a licence fee based on the number of players and also offers an annual subscription model for a basket of simulations. The pricing is in the range of Rs 2,500-5,000 per simulation for off-the-shelf products. Customised products cost between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh. According to Jayaraman, those prices are comparable with other simulation products in the market.</p>\n<p class="p6">Knolskape has formidable competition in the form of Harvard Business Publishing, but its USP lies in customising case studies as well as offering soft skills training through simulations. Similarly, while Sweden&rsquo;s BTS offers simulation-based leadership development for corporate customers, that is largely centred on top management, whereas Jayaraman&rsquo;s company covers almost all levels of hierarchy, ranging from frontline managers to CXOs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">The ability to customise products will give the company an edge when it comes to scaling up, believes Jayaraman. But the challenge is attracting the right talent, with technical as well as design knowledge. &ldquo;It is not easy to get people with knowledge in design as well as computer science,&rdquo; he rues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">Having moved to India in 2009 with an eight-member team, the company now has 20 employees, including engineers from BITS Pilani (Jayaraman&rsquo;s alma mater), designers and product managers, who create the simulation gaming products. Now, he plans to build a marketing team to evangelise experiential learning and simulation and make the company more visible to academicians and companies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">Knolskape&rsquo;s had a fairy tale journey so far: zero investment, blue-chip clients and no marketing effort. Jayaraman is confident his client base will only expand going forward &mdash; indeed, his aim is to cross Rs 100-crore topline in the next five years. &ldquo;Today, if you miss a lecture at 9 am, it&rsquo;s gone. There will come a time when the student will be in the in driver&rsquo;s seat, gaining access to knowledge about anything, anywhere and at any time.&rdquo; And Knolskape is ensuring it&rsquo;s perfectly placed to cash in on that transformation as and when it takes place.&nbsp;</p>', 'When a theatre enthusiast mixes his love for drama with technology, the result is a company like Knolskape', '33', '', 0, '', 'a-creative-bent-of-mind-301', 296, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'A creative bent of mind', 'When a theatre enthusiast mixes his love for drama with technology, the result is a company like Knolskape', '', '', '', 'Knolskape,Virtual learning,Experiential learning,Simulation-based learning', 0, NULL, '2015-01-29 11:59:59', '2015-01-29 12:17:08', '2013-04-27', 0);

(302, 12, '', 'Ready, steady, roll', '<p class="p1">Circa 2005. A newcomer to Mumbai steps out of Chhatrapati Shivaji Airport to be greeted by a vast bank of black-and-yellow taxis. Any thoughts of an easy ride home, though, are quickly dispelled &mdash; the drivers refuse to go by the meter, which, in any case, is likely to be rigged. There is little point in rejecting one cabbie and moving on to another: they are part of a cartel that expects compensation for having waited for passengers. With luggage in hand and the clock ticking, the traveller gives in without too much fuss, knowing all the while he&rsquo;s being taken for a ride &mdash; literally.</p>\n<p class="p3">Fast forward nearly a decade. After collecting your luggage from the carousel, you head to the counters near the departure gate and ask for a car to your destination. Within minutes of stepping out of the terminal, a cab draws up, the driver politely loads your bags into the boot, the air-conditioner is turned on and you get a printed receipt at the end of your GPS-guided journey. Welcome to the world of radio taxis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Call cabs - Element</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">This isn&rsquo;t a new business &mdash; call taxis (also called fleet or radio taxis) have been around since the turn of the millennium in southern cities like Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. But it was Meru, which launched in Mumbai in 2006, that really moved the business into high gear. Now the megapolis alone has approximately 5,000 such cabs from four brands, and similar services have sprung up not only in metros but also in smaller cities such as Lucknow, Ludhiana, Patna and Raipur. Private equity (PE) has already displayed its interest in this growing business and everybody seems to be in expansion mode. Just what is driving this growth?</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Revving up</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Certainly, the math is in favour of radio taxis. Sample this: the EMI on a sedan can be Rs 12,000-15,000, a driver&rsquo;s salary is upward of Rs 10,000 a month, while petrol costs for a 40-km commute is upward of Rs 250 daily. That&rsquo;s about Rs 30,000 a month and it doesn&rsquo;t include parking and vehicle maintenance charges. A 40-km trip in a radio taxi, in contrast, costs about Rs 800 (most operators across cities charge a uniform Rs 20 per km after the first km of travel), which works out to just Rs 16,000 a month. Sure, conditions apply &mdash; bookings need to be made in advance and last-minute cancellations aren&rsquo;t unheard-of. But all the evidence points to a growing demand for these services. The market is estimated at just over Rs 2,500 crore, growing at 15% a year. Of the 480,000 taxis on Indian roads, only 15,000 are radio cabs &mdash; and estimates suggest that even 30,000 fleet taxis will be barely enough. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Currently, the numbers are nowhere close to that. Meru, Mumbai&rsquo;s first radio taxi service, started with just 45 cars and now operates 5,600 cars across four cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad). Mega Cabs, which has operations in seven cities, has 2,800 cars, while Easy Cab runs 3,000 radio taxis in four cities. Newcomer Tab Cab has 2,800 taxis in Mumbai, while smaller players such as Priyadarshini and Viira collectively account for just over 60 cars in the city. Flash Cabs in Lucknow runs 20 cars while Pune&rsquo;s Wings Radio Cabs has a fleet of 50 cabs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Those numbers are set to grow. Kunal Lalani, chairman of Mega Cabs, says the company will have 4,500 vehicles by end-June while Jagdish Purohit, managing director of Tab Cab, declares his fleet will grow to 4,000 cabs by December after which the company will launch services in Delhi and Bengaluru. Meru, meanwhile, will add another 1,000 vehicles to take the total to 6,600 (<em>see: In high gear</em>). And Shashank Agarwal, CEO of Flash Cabs, which rolled out services in Lucknow in November 2012, is already talking of doubling fleet size to 40 by end-April. &ldquo;There is lack of awareness but the number of transactions is increasing rapidly, indicating the possibility of fast growth going forward,&rdquo; he predicts.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>In high gear- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Indeed, increasingly, tier 2 cities are also showing up on the radar of radio taxis. Carzonrent founder Rajiv K Vij, whose company runs Easy Cabs, points out that there is potential for significant growth in cities such as Chandigarh, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Visakhapatnam, Bhubaneswar and Ranchi, among others. &ldquo;There is financial prosperity, high usage of automobiles and many premium hotels are opening up in these places. Moreover, corporate customers are moving to these cities, airports are being renovated and these will become important points for car rental services,&rdquo; he lists.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"There is potential for significant growth in cities such as Chandigarh, Jaipur, Ranchi and Visakhapatnam" - Rajiv K Vij, CEO, Carzonrent</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Lalani of Mega Cabs agrees. &ldquo;The ailments of metros plague smaller cities too. There are traffic nightmares, it is not easy to get drivers and cost-benefit analysis favours renting a car over owning one,&rdquo; he points out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Limited partnership</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">How does the fleet taxi business work? In Delhi, operators can get a permit for by paying just Rs 4,000. Those permits are hard to come by in Mumbai &mdash; issue of new permits was halted in 1997, citing the large number of taxis already on the roads. However, operators such as Meru, Mega and Easy Cabs have grown their fleets in the city either by persuading black-and-yellow cabbies to switch to radio cabs or taking their permits on lease for 15-20 years. The payments made range from Rs 1 lakh to over Rs 2 lakh. In contrast, Tab Cab (promoted by the Nagpur-based SMS Infrastructure) started off with a bang by buying 4,000 permits during a rare auction by the Maharashtra state transport department, paying a staggering #2.61 lakh per permit. (Auctions of permits aren&rsquo;t a regular event; even now, the department is learnt to be sitting on 12,000 permits that it is yet to auction.) Other cities don&rsquo;t have the legacy of a robust taxi culture, resulting in permits being available easily at much lower prices.</p>\n<p class="p3">Even if permit prices vary widely, most operators follow a similar business model where they share revenue with drivers. &ldquo;Drivers are our business partners; they pay us a fixed amount every day. They are not our employees or wagers,&rdquo; points out Purohit. Typically, a vehicle starts making profits after four years. Here&rsquo;s the math. All fleet owners buy vehicles on loans; for an Rs 8.5-lakh sedan, the annual repayment is close to Rs 2 lakh. Assuming the car runs for 300 days in a year, it earns a rental of Rs 3.6 lakh annually, from which insurance, maintenance and repairs can take up to Rs 1 lakh. That leaves the operator only around Rs 60,000 per vehicle per year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Drivers are our business partners; they pay us a fixed amount every day. They are not our employees or wagers" - Jagdish Purohit, MD, Tab Cab</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">For drivers, being part of a radio taxi fleet works out very well. Not only are they assured business, all they have to pay for is the daily rental and fuel &mdash; all income after these deductions belongs to them. In addition, some fleets such as Tab Cab offer additional benefits, such as medical claims and monthly offs. Purohit adds that if a Tab Cab driver earns under Rs 12,000 a month, the company makes up the shortfall. That&rsquo;s an unlikely scenario. Most drivers do daily runs of 100 km, which earns them Rs 2,000 a day. CNG costs about Rs 2.6 a km, which means a daily outgo of Rs 260; after paying that and the Rs 1,200 rental, the driver is still left with about Rs 540 every day. Which explains why about half the radio taxi drivers in Mumbai are switchovers from regular cabs.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Hailing investors</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Not surprisingly, PE investors have already displayed their interest in the sector. The Rs 300-crore Carzonrent India, which operates Easy Cabs, received its first round of PE funding from Sidbi Ventures in 2005 &mdash; Rs 6 crore for a 10% stake. Subsequently, Sequoia Capital pumped in $6 million in 2006 and in 2011, the company raised Rs 36 crore in a third round of PE funding from BTS Investment Advisors. Today, PE firms hold more than 30% in the company. And Vij continues to be upbeat on the potential. &ldquo;The model is very scalable. We will add 15,000 more radio taxis by FY16,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There is scope for much more.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s a thought echoed by Pramod Kabra, partner at India Value Fund (IVF), which invested Rs 50 crore in Meru Cabs in December 2006 and an undisclosed sum (said to be Rs 160 crore) after that. IVF now owns 85% of the company. &ldquo;We like to invest in companies or segments where leaders have not yet emerged and the growth potential is huge. What has happened in London and Singapore [the development of a robust radio taxi system] can happen here too and we believe Meru is well placed to capture the market,&rdquo; he points out. Without sharing exact numbers, he adds that Meru will have made a net profit on a topline of Rs 180 crore in FY13 &mdash; the first year it will show a profit. &ldquo;Three cities [barring Mumbai] give us 20% return on capital employed,&rdquo; he says, referring to the operator&rsquo;s presence in Delhi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s a telling exclusion. Without exception, all operators believe the radio taxi business has scope for great growth. &ldquo;Mumbai has a taxi culture, unlike Delhi or Bengaluru where autos are preferred. We have the advantage of positive legacy here and the numbers will continue to grow,&rdquo; says IVF&rsquo;s Kabra. Right now, though, the numbers for Mumbai &mdash; the biggest market for taxis, given its role as the financial capital of the country as well as regulations that restrict autorickshaws to the suburbs &mdash; are hardly encouraging.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Potholes in Mumbai</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">No radio taxi player is making money in Mumbai, the city with the highest number of radio taxis and trips &mdash; nearly 18,000 a day. &ldquo;Mumbai has been giving us negative return on capital employed for the past five years,&rdquo; admits Siddharth Pahwa, CEO of Meru Cabs. Radio taxi owners point out three factors behind the lack of profitability in Mumbai.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">First, until September 2010, the radio taxi fare as set by the state government was a low Rs 15 per km even though it was Rs 20 in other cities; the rate in Mumbai was hiked to Rs 20 only in November 2012. Second, the airport in Mumbai is in the middle of the city, so travel from the suburbs to the airport doesn&rsquo;t really run up the meter as much as it does in Delhi or Bengaluru, where the airport is still in the outskirts. Third, poor road conditions and high corrosion levels increase repair costs and, therefore, operating costs in Mumbai.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There&rsquo;s also a political angle, although no one talks about it on record. Some radio taxi businesses are backed by politicians and are seen as exempt from the woes afflicting other players. Meanwhile, there&rsquo;s a new regulation according to which an individual has to be a resident of Maharashtra for at least 15 years to be eligible for a cab driving permit. It&rsquo;s a vote bank-pleasing move that effectively bars all recent immigrants, who have so far been making up the bulk of taxi drivers in the city. Which means there&rsquo;s now an acute shortage of fleet taxi drivers in Mumbai.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Operators have also, at various points in time, faced opposition from regular taxi drivers&rsquo; unions, which have seen their numbers reducing as drivers opted for radio cabs. While all operators have disallowed the forming of unions in their companies, Meru has been plagued by frequent strikes by drivers since its inception. The last strike at the company lasted 18 days in February, and saw the company addressing customers through print and social media, alleging it was the victim of a ploy to lure away its drivers. &ldquo;We have never recognised or derecognised any union. But people can bring any organisation to a standstill,&rdquo; says Pahwa.</p>\n<p class="p3">As it is, the consensus is that in the long run, not more than two or three large operators will survive in the radio taxi market. &ldquo;This is an operationally challenging and capex-heavy business,&rdquo; says Pahwa. &ldquo;Over time, large players are able to build network efficiencies while small players get left out. And that is when consolidation starts.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Fleet taxis are an operationally-challenging and capex-heavy business" - Siddharth Pahwa, CEO, Meru Cabs</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">But that&rsquo;s still some time away. Right now, fleet cabs are still the most practical and economical for many corporates and professionals in big cities &mdash; and increasingly, in small towns as well. In the past one year alone, radio taxi services have been launched in Raipur (Eco Cabs), Lucknow (Flash Cabs), Nagpur (Wings Radio Cabs) and Patna (Mauryan Cabs). Looks like nobody will be lifting their foot off the accelerator any time soon.</p>', 'Increasing traffic snarls and fuel costs are driving commuters to fleet taxis', '33', '', 0, '', 'ready-steady-roll-302', 297, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Ready, steady, roll', 'Increasing traffic snarls and fuel costs are driving commuters to fleet taxis', '', '', '', 'Call taxis,Radio taxis,Meru,Mega Cabs,Easy Cabs,Tab Cab', 0, NULL, '2015-01-29 12:18:22', '2015-01-29 13:21:35', '2013-04-27', 0),
(303, 16, '', 'Small town blues', '<p class="p1">Till just about a year ago, cities such as Jaipur and Ahmedabad were building a reputation not just as must-see destinations for tourists but also as business hubs for large companies. These secondary cities, along with others like Bhubaneswar and Chandigarh, were the toast of IT, ITeS and financial services companies as they expanded back-end operations here to take advantage of lower rentals and a more affordable local workforce. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It seems to have been a shortlived trend, though. Rising real estate prices in these smaller cities and an uncertain macro-economic environment have once again rendered them less attractive for such companies. According to the recently released Demand Analysis and Real Estate Trends (DART) report on office space occupancy by real estate consultancy DTZ India, only 27% of the companies polled had plans to go to secondary cities in 2013, down from 35% in 2012.</p>\n<p class="p3">Much of the rush to tier 2 cities was driven by demand-supply issues. Ramesh Nair, MD (west) at Jones Lang LaSalle India, says between 2005 and 2007, many companies began to set up shop in smaller towns because there wasn&rsquo;t enough supply in the metros.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Things have changed quite a bit now, as office space rentals in tier 2 cities have risen and, in some cases, are comparable to peripheral locations of metro cities. Capital value per sq ft of office space in Pune is around Rs 4,500, which is nearly as high as Noida, where prices are in the Rs 5,000-6,000 range. &ldquo;Companies would rather be in Noida than in Jaipur, which has almost the same office rentals,&rdquo; adds Rohit Kumar, head of research, DTZ India.</p>\n<p class="p3">There are other problems that come with moving to a secondary city. Ravi Ahuja, executive director, Cushman and Wakefield India, notes, &ldquo;Nearly 80% of people who apply for jobs there are not employable; so, even though the wage cost may be lower, getting the right people becomes a problem.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Infrastructure, too, hasn&rsquo;t kept pace with demand. Reeling under the pressures of rapid growth, the quality and delivery of public utilities in these cities leaves much to be desired. &ldquo;There are five-hour power cuts in many places. And when you are on the outskirts of a city, transportation costs go up as you have to provide transport for your employees,&rdquo; Ahuja adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But as with most trends, this one too is likely to make a comeback when the economy revs up. Right now, says Kumar, &ldquo;those from the IT, BFSI and telecom sectors have been hit hard. We have seen that companies such as Infosys, Cognizant and TCS have pared down their forecasts and cut back manpower intake.&rdquo; That will change along with the economic climate. &ldquo;Things will look up after the second quarter of this year. Demand will be renewed for office space and when stock in tier 1 cities gets exhausted, focus will shift to tier 2 cities,&rdquo; he concludes.

The big challenge is to ensure that it doesn&rsquo;t come across as one annoyingly long commercial. Mayank Pareek, COO (marketing &amp; sales), Maruti Suzuki, admits that the key is to seamlessly integrate the movie&rsquo;s content and storyline with what the brand has to say. Eight years ago, Maruti Suzuki had first tasted success with its newly launched Swift featuring prominently in Yashraj Films&rsquo; <em>BuntyAur Babli</em>.</p>\n<p class="p3">Prathap Suthan, managing partner at Bang in the Middle, an independent advertising agency, cautions that this is a route fraught with risk. &ldquo;If the film had flopped, the brand&rsquo;s image would have tanked. That said, only Maruti could have pulled it off since the brand is generic.&rdquo; On a total budget of Rs 10 crore &mdash; production costs being Rs 5.5 crore and promotions and advertising accounting for Rs 4.5 crore &mdash; the film has managed theatrical collections of over Rs 11 crore. MSM, which owns the Sony television channels, is said to have paid Rs 2 crore for the satellite rights. &ldquo;Actually, most of the money came in before the release and we needed to make just Rs 1.5 crore to recover cost,&rdquo; says Ashish Patil, business and creative head at Y Films.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Predictably, Pareek is excited about the prospects of this model. He is confident that content integration will be the next big thing in brand building: &ldquo;If people are hooked on to the content, the brand will get a chance to be seen or heard.&rdquo; As for the film maker, Patil is thinking of a sequel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&mdash; Krishna Gopalan</p>', 'Does Mere Dad Ki Maruti show the way for advertiser-funded cinema in India?', '7', '', 0, '', 'dude-wheres-my-ertiga-304', 299, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Dude, where''s my Ertiga?', 'Does Mere Dad Ki Maruti show the way for advertiser-funded cinema in India?', '', '', '', 'Yash Raj Films,Maruti Suzuki', 0, NULL, '2015-01-29 13:30:29', '2015-01-29 13:34:25', '2013-04-27', 0),

Till four years ago, Anugraha had a two-stage process for dyeing the t-shirts, leggings and women&rsquo;s tops it produces and exports. That was until Bengaluru-based Novozymes South Asia introduced Kumaar to a better enzyme that helped bring this down to a single-stage process. &ldquo;We are able to save an hour per batch, and much more in water and power costs,&rdquo; says Kumaar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Enzymes &mdash; biodegradable proteins found in living organisms &mdash; catalyse body functions such as digestion and blood clotting. Industrially, these catalysers can replace conventionally used chemicals and speed up industrial processes, saving costs and reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It takes around 150,000 litres of clean water to produce 1 tonne of knitwear. According to Novozymes&rsquo; Danish parent, if the textile industry across the world adopts enzymatic solutions in the production of cotton textiles, it could save 28% on water, 80% on chemicals and 25% on its energy costs. That may sound like marketing spiel, but there is no denying that with 47% market share globally, Novozymes &mdash; Novo Nordisk in its original avatar &mdash; counts detergents, food and beverages, textile and pharmaceuticals players as its primary customers.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>World of their own- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Its India story is nowhere as spectacular. While Novozymes South Asia dominates with a 50% share in the Indian enzymes market, it&rsquo;s a small pie worth just Rs 600 crore roughly and populated by 17-odd players (<em>see: World of their own</em>). That, after three decades in the country, doesn&rsquo;t count for much. Though Novozymes&rsquo; journey in India has been one of sluggish growth, it only mirrors the evolution of a business that&rsquo;s taking off now.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>A long journey</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">First, a bit of history. &ldquo;In 1983, we had a liaison office with two employees,&rdquo; recalls GS Krishnan, president, Novozymes South Asia, who&rsquo;s been with the company for 22 years. The first port of call was the brewing industry. Soon after, India&rsquo;s economic liberalisation opened up new sectors. Detergents were the most promising, as more Indians took to premium products like Surf Excel and Ariel. &ldquo;By the mid 1990s, the enzymatic detergent caught up well here,&rdquo; points out Krishnan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Soap opera- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In 1998, Novozyme set up full-fledged operations in India. A couple of years later, a re-tapping facility was set up to package bulk enzymes imported from its centres in the US, Denmark and China into smaller quantities for sale. Adapting to Indian conditions was key. &ldquo;Western stains are sauce-based, but ours are curry-based. So, we tweaked our detergent enzymes accordingly for the Indian market.&rdquo; Now, detergents bring in 35% of revenues (<em>see: Soap opera</em>), and Krishnan says all leading detergent players such as Unilever and P&amp;G are Novozyme customers globally. Soon enough, industries such as beverages and textiles, too, began toying with advanced processes. Textile companies used enzymes, for example, to create the &lsquo;stone washed&rsquo; effect in jeans, while distilleries used them for manufacturing grain-based alcohol as a better substitute for molasses-based alcohol.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Small is beautiful- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Though detergents are the largest category for enzyme makers in India, only 15% of detergent brands in the market today are enzymatic. The adoption is even lower in other categories. &ldquo;There are structural issues in India. For example, the extent of food processing, where enzymes have an application, is low here. In the West, baking enzymes are used in bread, but in India we have traditional foods like <em>roti</em>, <em>naan</em> etc. It is hard to target such traditional segments,&rdquo; points out Piyush Rathi, managing director of the Thane-based Advanced Vital Enzymes &mdash; Novozymes&rsquo; closest competitor in India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">He may have a point there. Unlike markets elsewhere in the world, price-conscious consumers and manufacturers in India have been reluctant converts until now. &ldquo;Selling an enzyme is a highly technical proposition. You need to demonstrate the benefits,&rdquo; says Krishnan. This means working closely with customers and demonstrating on site how enzymes can help cut costs and shore up efficiency. For instance, Rathi&rsquo;s comment notwithstanding, Novozymes has developed an enzyme that keeps <em>rotis</em> and <span class="s1"><em>n</em></span><em>aan</em> fresher for longer, which finds takers in restaurants and packaged foods companies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Chaitra Vijaypura Narayan, associate director of the chemicals materials &amp; food practice at Frost &amp; Sullivan India, agrees that potential users need plenty more convincing on the value proposition of enzymes. &ldquo;These can&rsquo;t be stored like chemicals for a long time. Then, there is the initial cost factor &mdash; a textile bleaching enzyme, for instance, is 25-30% costlier than a peroxide chemical, though this cost is compensated by savings later,&rdquo; she explains. Also, the volumes are still too small to justify setting up a submerged fermentation plant, needed to produce enzymes. Little surprise, then, that 75% of industrial enzymes sold in India are still imported.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Going for the kill</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">In 2006, when Novozymes opened its research and development centre in India, it wasn&rsquo;t at the top of its game; homegrown Biocon was, in fact, chugging right ahead. &ldquo;Biocon was big time into enzymes then,&rdquo; points out Narayan. That&rsquo;s when Novozymes made a bold gambit. In FY07, it bought Biocon&rsquo;s Rs 100-crore enzymes business, accounting for 12% of its business, at a high multiple of around five times. It paid Rs 460 crore for the business, which was largely producing pectinase enzymes for the juice and wine segment.</p>\n<p class="p3">Competitor Rathi, though, is critical of the deal. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they benefited from the acquisition. The wine and juice segment hasn&rsquo;t offered them much growth,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Consider this. Post acquisition, Novozymes&rsquo; turnover more than doubled from Rs 100 crore in FY07 to Rs 225 crore in FY08. But, in the following four years it has managed a CAGR of just 7% to touch Rs 297 crore in FY12 (<em>see: One-time pop?</em>). At the time of the buy, the parent company had mentioned that it expected &ldquo;the acquired business to have a long-term annual growth of more than 15% in sales.&rdquo;&nbsp;But currently it is the detergents and textiles segments that are its biggest revenue contributors, with food and beverages and other segments accounting for the balance. Krishnan, however, defends the buyout. &ldquo;We were not market leaders but managed to become one after the acquisition. Also, in a scattered and vast market such as India, we got a strong distribution network and today 95% of what we produce is exported.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>One-time pop?- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">According to the management, the growth in the wine and beverage segment in India is nascent, while demand in export market is seasonal. Krishnan says, &ldquo;Consider the juice market in Australia: if the apple crop is good, the demand will be high and so will be the growth and <em>vice versa</em> if the crop is bad.&rdquo; The company, however, refused to divulge the current contribution of the Biocon business to its overall turnover.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Growth pangs</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Five years since the buyout, Novozymes is now looking at strategic R&amp;D alliances to add its 200-odd product portfolio. One is with Pune-based Praj Industries on developing second-generation biofuels in India. The other is an exploratory research agreement with IIT Chennai-incubated Sea6 Energy to jointly develop a process for making biofuels from seaweed. Srikumar Suryanarayan, chairman, Sea6 Energy, says the partnership was a natural one. &ldquo;We have managed to grow weed in seawater, but we needed someone who could develop an enzyme to convert seaweed into ethanol.&rdquo; He expects to move to pilot project stage in three-four years.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Investments in biofuels might not appeal to many today, but in five-six years, they will be very important,&rdquo; says Narayan. The focus on this business is also in line with the company&rsquo;s global strategy, outlined recently by Novozymes&rsquo; new global CEO Holk Nielsen who assumed charge on April 1. However, in India, like other developing markets, biofuels haven&rsquo;t taken off, thanks to food security concerns and the lack of a comprehensive roadmap for the sector. So, is it worthwhile to put in money and so much time on biofuels in India? &ldquo;There have been implementation issues. But for the future, going green and clean is a wise thing to do,&rdquo; says Narayan.</p>\n<p class="p3">As for profitability and growth forecasts, Krishnan refuses to share numbers but adds, &ldquo;We are profitable in India. Otherwise how would a two-employee company grow to 400-plus people company and sustain?&rdquo; But with larger competitors like DuPont &mdash; which ranks second globally, with a 21% share of the $3.8-billion market&mdash; entering the fray with similar offerings, it&rsquo;s time for Novozymes to step up its game to stay in the reckoning.&nbsp;</p>', 'Novozymes is working on a growth formula that will sustain its leadership in the enzymes space', '9', '', 0, '', 'the-change-agent-305', 300, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'The change agent ', 'Novozymes is working on a growth formula that will sustain its leadership in the enzymes space', '', '', '', 'Industrial enzymes,Novozymes South Asia', 0, NULL, '2015-01-29 13:36:45', '2015-01-29 13:50:21', '2013-04-27', 0),

(307, 20, '', 'Stuck in a rut', '<p class="p1">How&rsquo;s this for an open offer? Buy a stock for Rs 22 from the open market and sell it for Rs 340. Sounds like a no-brainer but the only hitch is that we are talking of a hypothetical situation. The stock in question is that of ports major Marg, which is trading at Rs 22 and is liable to make an mandatory open offer at Rs 340. However, whether the offer will fructify or not is in question, given that the promoters and the regulator are at loggerheads over the offer.</p>\n<p class="p3">In October 2011, the promoters had made a voluntary open offer to acquire up to 76.5 lakh shares, or 20% of diluted capital, at #91 a share. However, on inspection of the documents, Sebi detected two instances of violations of the Takeover Code that bars promoters from acquiring shares in excess of 5% in a year. In February 2007, Marg had issued 27 lakh GDRs to non-promoters, in turn paring the promoter&rsquo;s stake to 36%. A month later, the promoters raised their stake to 50% by converting 37 lakh warrants. Again, in March 2011, promoter holding rose to 49.84% against 42.48% in the previous quarter. As a result, Sebi directed the promoters to make an mandatory open offer based on the then-prevailing price of around Rs 216. Together with interest of Rs 214 a share, the price worked out to Rs 340 a share. But the management&rsquo;s contention was that the increase in holding was not due to secondary market share purchase. The case is now with the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT). While the promoter has also put in a plea to withdraw the open offer, Sebi has ruled that takeover regulations do not permit withdrawal of a mandatory open offer. In case the SAT upholds the ruling, Marg could move the Supreme Court (SC), feel market observers. In such a case it will be a long-drawn affair and the situation could get tricky for investors. Sanjay Arora, CIO, Escorts Mutual Fund, who in the past has successfully played the arbitrage game available in open offers, is wary of buying into Marg. &ldquo;Several cases of open offers are still being heard in the SC. These cases can drag on for years, so there is no point holding a stock under these circumstances,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">A case in point is that of Nirma which wants to withdraw its open offer made for Shree Rama Multi-tech in 2006, alleging governance violations. Nirma had then harped on Sec 27 (1) (d) of the Takeover Code, which allows withdrawal of the offer under &ldquo;special circumstances&rdquo;. But Sebi refused to accept that the argument and pointed out that Nirma should have done its due diligence before acquiring the company. Nirma had in 2008 moved the SC, which is yet to give its final judgement.</p>\n<p class="p3">However, investors looking for a quick gain still have an opportunity. Shriram EPC has made an open offer for Orient Green Power at Rs 15 while its current price is Rs 14. &ldquo;Investors can still make a return of 7% on the trade,&rdquo; sums up Escorts Mutual Fund&rsquo;s Arora.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&mdash;V Keshavdev</p>', 'A Sebi-promoter wrangle could throw Marg''s open offer off course', '5', '', 0, '', 'stuck-in-a-rut-307', 301, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Stuck in a rut ', 'A Sebi-promoter wrangle could throw Marg''s open offer off course', '', '', '', 'Sebi,Open offer,Marg', 0, NULL, '2015-01-29 14:24:33', '2015-01-29 14:28:23', '2013-04-27', 0),

(309, 20, '', 'Lights, camera, digital', '<p class="p1">Surat&rsquo;s Valecha Road is called the <em>subzi mandi</em> of theatres by folks in the film industry. The 3 km-long stretch has 17 licensed &lsquo;video parlours&rsquo; with up to 125 seats each, which play movies from CDs. Atul Patel, a film distributor to 60 screens across Gujarat, owns 10 such parlours; he also has a two-screen multiplex coming up in at Kangori in Poladpur, Maharashtra. Patel owned only two video parlours when he first invested in digital equipment in 2007. &ldquo;It [this growth] wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible but for digitisation,&rdquo; agrees the owner of the &lsquo;Modern Movie&rsquo; video parlours, whose digitisation service provider is the Chennai-based Real Image Media Technologies. &ldquo;Screening films first day-first show has done the magic.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The success of Surat&rsquo;s video parlours is playing out at standalone screens as well. The first day Salman Khan&rsquo;s blockbuster <em>Dabangg 2</em> showed in Diamond Theatre, in Mumbai&rsquo;s western suburb of Borivali, a sea of humanity waited to make its way inside. The theatre&rsquo;s owner, octogenarian Mahmud Khan, has signed up with Mumbai-based UFO Digital Movies and like Patel, Khan says this kind of crowd pull would have been impossible had he not embraced digitisation in 2008 and started showing a film from the first day of its release.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In the pre-digitisation era, given the high costs of analog prints, most film-makers would release only 150-200 prints across the top cities. It would take several weeks for the used prints to reach smaller towns such as Surat, where demand for the movie would have already died out since pirated prints were easily available. &ldquo;We would show pirated prints within two days of release to attract crowds,&rdquo; admits Patel. Distributors and theatre owners in such places struggled to break even if the film was a hit, and their losses were heavy given that the flop rate in the Indian film industry is as high as 80%. Nearly eight years after the first theatres in India turned to digitisation, the technology is proving a win-win proposition for film-makers and theatre owners.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>The dream merchants</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">While there are a handful of companies in India that offer digital technology to theatres, the two big players are Real Image and UFO Digital Moviez, both of which started operations in 2005. With 4,000 and 2,900 screens respectively, UFO and Real Image account for the lion&rsquo;s share of the market. A new entrant is United Media Works (UMW), which uses its own digital distribution technology (Digibutor) to cater to only tier 2 and tier 3 towns. So far, it has three theatres in Gujarat and also shares its technology with six video parlours in Mumbai and Surat. &ldquo;Our model will be an out-and-out value model, for everything from tickets to F&amp;B,&rdquo; explains Ashish Bhandari, co-founder and MD, UMW. According to the Ficci-KPMG 2013 report on media and entertainment, close to 77% of theatres in India are now digitised, up from 50% in 2009; total digitisation is likely in the next two years. Digitisation has been a game changer for single-screen theatres, points out Arvind Ranganathan, CEO, Real Image. &ldquo;Many of our single-screen owners in South India are now offering more content: theatres in Tamil Nadu are now also airing Malayalam and Kannada films.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Ours is a value model, where everything from tickets to F&amp;B will be offered at a good value" - Ashish Bhandari, co-founder and MD, United Media Works</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Indeed, digitisation is helping reverse the slide in single-screen theatres. The Film Federation of India reports that single-screen theatres are disappearing &mdash; they were down from 13,000 to 10,167 in the last five years. This is largely because of the shortage of prints, which gets diverted to the irresistible lure of swanky multiplexes and large single-screen theatres in big cities, even though they add up to only 15% of the screens available in India. &ldquo;Digitisation has enabled scores of single-screen theatre owners to resurrect their dying business,&rdquo; agrees Pankaj Jaysinh, COO, UFO Digital Moviez.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Now showing: profits</strong></p>\n<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Digitisation is a positive-sum game for exhibitors. An analog theatre </span>typically spends about Rs 13 lakh on equipment (the projector, mainly). The distributor bears the cost of making the print (Rs 50,000-60,000 for each print, which can be used ideally for 300-400 screenings) and sending it to various theatres; in return, he gets a share of the ticket sales. The cost of equipment for digital theatres ranges from Rs 3 lakh to as much as #25 lakh, depending on the projector quality. Again, the distributor bears the cost of making the print (a maximum of Rs 18,000-20,000 per print), which the technology provider transmits to the theatre &mdash; both get a share of ticket sales. In many cases, rather than paying upfront for the equipment, theatre owners pay a share of the cost and then a monthly rental of Rs 15,000-30,000 to the service provider.</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>"Many single-screen owners in South India have upgraded themselves to become two-three screen cineplexes" - Arvind Ranganathan, CEO, Real Images</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">Convincing theatre owners to embrace digital technology has been a challenge since although there are no running costs, there is a large initial investment. That&rsquo;s when film producers decided to step in. &ldquo;The producers realised that digital screens would not only bring down their print costs by more than half, it would also result in wider screening,&rdquo; explains Gautam Dutta, CEO, PVR Pictures. &ldquo;They asked the service providers to offer the equipment at a substantial discount, so that the theatre owners are motivated to make the switch.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7"><strong>"Digitisation has enabled single-screen theatre owners to resurrect their dying businesses" - Pankaj Jaysinh, COO, UFO Digital Movies</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">After he went digital, Patel in Surat hiked his average ticket price from Rs 15 to Rs 30, which caused a temporary dip in footfalls. &ldquo;I released the film on the very first day and got a two-day lead while it took my competitors almost two days to screen the pirated version,&rdquo; he says, adding that very soon, his patrons did not mind the additional cost. Today, Patel gets full-house audiences for his Sunday shows, which he tickets at Rs 50 apiece, especially for blockbusters like <em>Dabangg 2 </em>or <em>Son of Sardar</em>. His monthly revenue has gone up nearly three-fold to close to Rs 3 lakh per screen for moderately <br /> successful movies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7">Diamond Theatre&rsquo;s Khan points to another advantage in going digital &mdash; more shows every day as well as variety in programming. &ldquo;Unlike before, when we had to manually mount the print on the projector for each show, frequently change the carbon sticks to ensure that the lighting on the screen is adequate, today everything gets controlled by UFO from their centralised server,&rdquo; he points out. Digital prints also have superior resolution over analogous prints. And instead of huge projectors, content is transferred to the theatre via satellite. &ldquo;This has enabled me to have more number of shows and, apart from the regular Hindi and Marathi films, squeeze in a show each of a Gujarati and Tamil films during weekends.&rdquo; Khan declines to share financials of his 571-seat theatre, but says he is able to hold out profitably with an average ticket price of Rs 72, which sells well against the Rs 200 charged by multiplexes.</p>\n<p class="p7">Like Khan, Praful Gandhi owes much to digitisation. The owner of the 41-year-old Sharda Theatre at Dadar in Mumbai would have had to down his shutters but for digitisation. The absence of air-conditioning and a gloomy ambience still keeps Hindi blockbusters away but Sharda has moved up from third-rate Hindi and Marathi films to first-day shows of hit Bhojpuri cinema. &ldquo;We now manage a decent 50-60% occupancy,&rdquo; Gandhi says, pointing out that 100% occupancy in a 1,150-seat theatre would be asking for too much.</p>\n<p class="p7">Similarly, Ratan Jain and Dharmesh Shah, the duo behind Gold Digital Cinema, who earlier produced and distributed films under the Time Audio and Video banner (<em>Khiladi, Vijaypath, Hero</em>), switched to the film exhibition business in 2006 only after the arrival of digitised films. &ldquo;We would have never ventured into film exhibition had it not been for digital cinema,&rdquo; says Ratan Jain, director, Gold Digital Cinema. The company launched its first screen in Gwalior in 2006, and since then has grown to 56 screens across the country, most of them old cinemas converted into digital screens in places such as Shillong, Alwar and Bilawal. Jain cites the example of his 100-seat theatre in Bilawal, which clocked revenues to the tune to Rs 20 lakh with the release of <em>Rowdy Rathore</em>. &ldquo;Bilawal has a population of around 500,000 and a film like <em>Rowdy Rathore</em> wouldn&rsquo;t have been released in a town as small as that, had we been on analog technology,&rdquo; he explains.</p>\n<p class="p8">&nbsp;<strong>Box-office bonanza</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">For film-makers, going digital has had a direct impact on the bottomline. They have been able to widen their reach considerably and at far cheaper rates (since digital prints cost less than a third of what physical prints cost). Then, since the film is transmitted electronically, it is possible to have same-day release across multiple theatres &mdash; <em>Dabangg 2</em>, for instance, was released in 3,000 theatres. Given that most films nowadays make at least 60% of their total box office earnings in the first week of release, simultaneous release is a masterstroke at ensuring revenue maximisation since it also reduces losses due to piracy (rampant in smaller towns that were shown delayed releases). With digital cinema, distribution costs are down by two-thirds, agrees Kamal Jain, CFO, Eros Entertainment, elaborating, &ldquo;Earlier, apart from the print costs, we used to incur expenditure on physically transporting the film to various places, which has been completely eliminated.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>"The huge sums on physically transporting the film to various places has now been eliminated" - Kamal Jain, CFO, Eros Entertainment&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">A recent KPMG study shows that ever since single-screen cinemas started upgrading their facilities, they have become indispensable for the box-office success of most&nbsp; mass-market films. A film such as <em>Agneepath</em>, for instance, had total collections of Rs 120.3 crore, 60% of which came from single-screen connections. Similarly, 58% of <em>Housefull 2</em>&rsquo;s revenues of Rs 112.8 crore came from single screens. According to the report, it&rsquo;s the same scene with moderate hits like <em>Vicky Donor</em>, which clocked revenues to the tune of Rs 38 crore (42% from single-screen cinemas), and <em>Ishaqzaade</em> (#37.5 crore; almost 53% from single-screen cinemas). &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7"><em>Dabangg 2</em> released across 3,000 screens and had earned nearly Rs 58 crore by the third day &mdash; the film&rsquo;s production cost was Rs 50 crore. &ldquo;Most films are able to touch the Rs 100 crore figure only because of digitisation,&rdquo; says Manmohan Shetty, chairman of Adlabs Entertainment. A pioneer in offering digital technology in India, Shetty sold his digital technology arm, Scrabble, to UFO last year.</p>\n<p class="p7">Indeed, the approach to film exhibition itself has changed. Rakesh Roshan&rsquo;s blockbuster, <em>Kkrish</em>, was released with 800 prints in the analog platform (read: huge distribution costs) in 2006. The total cost of making and releasing the film was in the region of Rs 41.5 crore and it garnered net revenues of Rs 69 crore. In contrast, Rani Mukherjees&rsquo;s 2012 release <em>Aiyyaa</em>, which had a budget of Rs 16 crore, was released in 942 centres (578 digital prints and 142 analog, adding up to a print cost of just over Rs 2 crore). <em>Aiyyaa</em> was declared a flop after it fetched just Rs 7 crore at the box office in the first week but, &ldquo;Thanks to a digital release, <em>Aiyyaa</em> was able to release in more centres at a much lower cost,&rdquo; says UFO&rsquo;s Jaysinh. &ldquo;Had the film been released only on analog, its distribution cost alone would have been in the region of Rs 3.2 crore and the losses would have been higher.&rdquo; Almost 80% of the films released these days are going digital.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7">Small films have also flourished. The Vidya Balan starrer, <em>Kahaani</em>, was released in 700 theatres despite being made on a shoestring budget of Rs 11.5 crore and it totted up net revenues of Rs 68 crore. &ldquo;If screens were not digitised, we would have never looked at releasing a small budget film beyond 200 theatres,&rdquo; points out Kamal Gianchandani, president, PVR Pictures, the production and distribution arm of the PVR cinema brand.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7"><strong>"If screens were not digitised, we would not have released a small budget film beyond 200 theatres" - Kamal Gianchandani, president, PVR Pictures</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">More importantly, losses are also minimised. Gianchandani goes on to cite the example of one of PVR&rsquo;s small budget releases. <em>Teen Thay Bhai</em>, which didn&rsquo;t do too well at the box office. PVR released the film in 650 theatres and it made sense to do so only because it was being released on the same day across the country. &ldquo;Had it been on analog, we wouldn&rsquo;t have looked at more than 30 cities,&rdquo; Gianchandani confirms. &ldquo;More importantly, theatre owners beyond these 30 cities would have refused to take the film a week later because it was declared a flop. The same day release across cities has helped us cut losses in a big way.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p7">The FICCI-KPMG Entertainment report puts the current size of the domestic theatrical industry at Rs 8,510 crore in 2012, estimated to grow at a CAGR of 10.8% to cross Rs 14,220 crore in 2017. While Ranganathan of Real Image expects the number of screens to grow to 20,000 in the next three to four years, Eros&rsquo; Jain shares some interesting statistics, &ldquo;The US has 117 screens for every million population but we only have 12 screens for every million population in India.&rdquo; The Ficci report estimates that number to be even lower &mdash; just eight screens for every million people.

(311, 24, '', 'The art of social investing', '<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A</span>sit Koticha is a man who doesn&rsquo;t speak to the media too often. And his rare interviews are all about markets and finance. But question Koticha on social causes and the floodgates open willingly. &ldquo;The need is humongous,&rdquo; says Koticha, founder and chairman, ASK Group, when he is asked what draws him to the many causes he supports. &ldquo;Wherever a rupee is spent, it creates social impact. Therefore, we are present in diverse areas: we work in education, in healthcare, in sports&nbsp;and in housing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">In education, Koticha supports the Sunbeam schools in Mumbai, which reach out to over 1,000 slum kids and children of construction workers, mill workers and domestic helpers living in <em>chawls</em>, enabling them to compete with their privileged peers and aspire for careers beyond their circumstances. &ldquo;We monitor their growth even after they have reached the level of higher education,&rdquo; Koticha says. He has also been instrumental in building schools and primary healthcare centres in Saurashtra. More than 1,500 houses have been built for the poor and Koticha&rsquo;s target is another 7,000-8,000 houses in the next few years. &ldquo;We are also supporting what is called the OGQ &mdash; the Olympic Gold Quest for 100 gold medals for India by 2020,&rdquo; adds the man who is chipping in for the Dhoni Foundation, too.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Another major project that has Koticha&rsquo;s considerable commitment and interest is a new department of philosophy and a convention centre for Mumbai University, his alma mater. &ldquo;We have committed Rs 32 crore for Mumbai University,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Till now, we have not taken any money from outside. Going forward, we may do so as the cost of the convention centre is going to go up to Rs 150-200 crore. We would like people to participate and give back to the university.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Apart from ASK Foundation and the Asit Koticha Foundation, Koticha channels his funds and time through an organisation called Life in Rajkot, which is concerned with preventing maternal mortality. His considerable expertise in the markets and his understanding of how money flows impact his commitment to social service as well, especially so in two ways.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;One is the way in which we look at investments and estimate the returns that we can generate,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Just as if I am investing in one company and not investing in another company by looking at what return I can get, I choose one activity over another by determining its impact vis-&agrave;-vis what we are not doing. That helps us decide better. Secondly, we are able to assess the human resource potential of people working in the social service sector &mdash; their vision, calibre, their ability to execute. So, we apply the same principles as we do in investing. We believe social spending is also social investing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;I get a lot of hope and encouragement from this,&rdquo; says Koticha, when asked if the magnitude of problems leads to despair. &ldquo;I always remember the starfish story. You are walking by a beach and so many starfish are dying on it. A guy is picking them up one at a time and throwing them back into the water. Another guy tells him it&rsquo;s not going to make any difference because so many of them are dying. His answer is that it&rsquo;s going to make a hell of a lot of difference to the one starfish that made it back to the sea.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Koticha&rsquo;s brother and wife are fully involved in his efforts. Besides, &ldquo;My daughter has recently completed her MBA and majored in social service,&rdquo; says the proud father. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s also very keen and intends to make it her career. So, as a family, we are all involved. It would be great if we are able to take it forward like this.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Somewhere in the next 10 years, Koticha says, &ldquo;We want to take up a district. Right now, there are various NGOs doing different things. Somebody is building houses in one village; somebody else is building a school in another. If we can all work together, the impact will be much better and larger.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">ASK supports its employees in participating in its social service endeavours. &ldquo;We go to villages along with our staff and their families. For example, if we are building houses for the poor, we actually lay the bricks with our own hands,&rdquo; says the famously camera-shy Koticha.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;The degree of involvement depends on the individual,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;Different people may wish to do things in different ways. That&rsquo;s up to them. I feel more inspired and fulfilled if I become involved directly. I recommend every person should try it.

(312, 24, '', 'A framework for success', '<p class="p1">After a long time, I have read a book that has engaged me from start to finish &mdash; especially a book on strategy. No jargon, no lecturing, no macro level truisms &mdash; just plain, down-to-earth learnings with very workable suggestions. This is what a successful CEO (Alan Lafley of P&amp;G) and a hands-on dean (Roger Martin of the Rotman School of Management) have produced in <em>Playing to Win</em>.</p>\n<p class="p3">Essentially, the writers have taken a fundamental approach to strategy &mdash; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a set of choices about winning&rdquo; &mdash; and how it drives you to decisions on where to play and how to win. Underlying all this is the basic premise of a clear vision backed by an insightful understanding of your customers, both trade and consumers. None of this will work unless you have the internal capabilities (people) and resources (money).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The book is filled with the success and tribulations of P&amp;G brands such as Oil of Olay, Crest and Pampers, and the acquisition of Gillette, and how, in each case, strategy was employed to win. What I found most interesting was just how few of us go beyond analysing current competitive pressures without actually anticipating competitive action/reaction to our well-planned moves. Lafley and Martin emphasise that merely putting a strategy in place is not enough, unless a deep understanding of the market and consumer leads to the launch of a differentiated product. If one is unable to differentiate, it is imperative to be a genuine low-cost producer, otherwise one is doomed to failure. The other obvious elements like brand, distribution, pricing, advertising and promotion are a given and a must.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It is not enough to enter an attractive market or growing segment. You must then have one or both of these key strengths (low cost and differentiated product) to reap long-term gains. Mars successfully followed this strategy against Hershey in candy bars. Closer home, it was Parle-G biscuits that played the low-cost producer game and carved a huge segment in the biscuit market and, in fact, outplayed Britannia. It took Britannia years to retaliate with Tiger, a differentiated product in the glucose segment. I wish this book had been available to me earlier &mdash; it would have been invaluable during my tenure at Britannia!</p>\n<p class="p3">Mistakes, however, continue to occur. Companies feel they have the required strengths to enter a growing segment or a new market without ensuring that all the pieces that add up to a winning strategy are in place. Lipton&rsquo;s entry into biscuits, Marico&rsquo;s entry into health snacks, Unilever&rsquo;s earlier entry into noodles and GSK&rsquo;s entry into tetrapack milk-based drinks all can be found in the graveyard that houses product launches resulting from incomplete strategy.</p>\n<p class="p3">The lessons, then, are simple. Ask the right questions, simplify and crystallise the issues and come up with the right choices. Then, clearly communicate the same to your team and adopt the Lafley-Martin model for a winning strategy. Do not overestimate your strengths or underestimate the response of your competitors.

A study conducted by <strong>George P Gao </strong>and <strong>Qingzhong Ma</strong> examines the relationship between insider silence and extreme future stock returns, which could be either positive or negative. By looking at extreme scenarios like mergers and bankruptcy that occurred between 1992 and 2010, their research proves that in case of mergers insiders refrain from buying the stocks before the announcement and insiders of a bankruptcy firms avoid selling before the filing. Also, to protect themselves, insiders abstain from trading for a longer time if the information is more extreme. Thus, a longer period of silence is associated with even more extreme returns.</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>Title:&nbsp;</strong>The Sound of Silence: What Do We Know When Insiders Do Not Trade?</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>Source: </strong>Social Science Research Network</p>\n<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>The flip side of star CEOs</strong></span></p>\n<p class="p1">An organisation&rsquo;s performance depends highly on its CEO&rsquo;s decision-making skills.

(313, 24, '', 'Animal spirits', '<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I</span>t&rsquo;s well enough known that the French would rather discuss terroir than tigers, so a French spirit &mdash; that too, a <em>vodka</em> &mdash; that donates part of its profits to saving the tiger in the wild is exceptional enough to be rare. Perhaps that conviction comes from Renaud Dutreil&rsquo;s cosmopolitanism as a resident of New York, or maybe it&rsquo;s part of his belief in contributing to the planet. Either way, it serves to muddy the waters enough so you stutter when asking why the French, so provincial when it comes to guarding the GI for their champagnes and cognacs, are delving into Soviet terrain with the Tigre Blanc.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;The vodka, packaged in a beautiful bottle with the requisite stripes, sounds as though it might be a white riesling, and even though the family has traditionally produced wine and cognac, on special occasions a clear spirit from an unlabelled bottle would be opened to serve to guests. This was the &ldquo;family recipe&rdquo; for what it now being bottled as the first wholly Made-in-France vodka (Grey Goose, though made in France, is an American brand). And with a launch in France in November 2012, and more recently in India as part of its international promotions scheduled for 2013, it&rsquo;s making a strong bid to take over what was considered Siberian gut rot, but has been refined through five distillations in copper Alembic stills that are typically used for making cognac, to create a spirit that is &ldquo;feminine, delicate, fun &mdash; a women&rsquo;s drink&rdquo;, according to Dutreil.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;A good vodka&rsquo;s charm lies in its lack of distinctive taste so that it mixes well, but in Tigre Blanc&rsquo;s case, it could be the use of water from the Cognac region and its deep layers of filteration that give it an edge. &ldquo;Grain alcohol,&rdquo; says Dutreil, &ldquo;has been part of the French tradition.&rdquo; Vodka itself is not entirely new to the country, having been courted in the mid-19th century when the Russians had invaded France, making it &ldquo;very fashionable&rdquo; at the time, though it lost its appeal in the interim decades till it became the darling of the swish cocktail set in the new millennium.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;If Tigre Blanc is being marketed as a luxury product (bottles are priced at Rs 2,360 for the classic and Rs 3,900 for the special editions), it&rsquo;s because Dutreil believes that it is &ldquo;more part of culture than economy, a bridge across cultures&rdquo;. And given France&rsquo;s ability to innovate and adapt, &ldquo;mixing&rdquo; &mdash; as in mixology &mdash; &ldquo;is a very important part of the DNA of this brand&rdquo;. Tigre Blanc, therefore, isn&rsquo;t intended for rough guys. It is, Dutreil insists, &ldquo;an elegant spirit&rdquo;, a &ldquo;love filter&rdquo; if you will, for young consumers across India, China and Brazil as much as the European continent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">No wonder the India launch, part of its debuts planned across key markets in Europe, North America, West Asia and Africa, where it will be available in duty free stores and in select bars, was accompanied by cocktails created by brand mixologist Ulric Nijs, using ingredients such as fruit extracts, vanilla liqueur, cream, and as an ode to India, curry leaves and rock salt. While simplicity and the ability to travel across cultures is obviously important when creating cocktails &mdash; Brazil&rsquo;s caipirinha, a great favourite in bars across the world, being such an instance &mdash; &ldquo;cocktail geekiness is the key to enjoying a good drink,&rdquo; Nijs says.

What&rsquo;s more, over 60% of current growth in the Rs 13,200-crore market is coming from within the industry. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Hair and there</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">Within a year of its launch in 2002, Trends in Vogue tried five different formats &mdash; men-only, women-only, very low-cost (#30 per haircut), family salon and high-end salon &mdash; finally settling for a mix of unisex high-end spa-and-salons (Limelite) and mid-range family salons (Green Trends). &ldquo;Till 2005-06, there were separate sections for men and women but, as the market and the &lsquo;culture of beauty&rsquo; evolved, we started having unisex hair cutting areas and separate sections for beauty treatments,&rdquo; explains R Gopalakrishnan, business head, Trends in Vogue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Today, a typical client is 25-35 years-old and, surprisingly, male. &ldquo;Men&rsquo;s grooming is now a big part of the market,&rdquo; says Ranganathan. The India Salon Report confirms this &mdash; 53% male respondents visit the salon once a month and 20% do it twice, with 67% trying out new services like hair massages or spa therapies. While the average monthly spend per person at a salon is Rs 1,500-2,000, women customers spend more than men.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">In return, they expect pampering service, a relaxing ambience and superior beauty products. So Limelite has secluded alcoves that replace the banter of a salon with a spa&rsquo;s tranquility, while customers are treated to premium products from L&rsquo;Oreal Professional, Skin Miracle (Malaysia) and Remy Laure (USA) in addition to house brands like Meera coconut oil and the Raaga Professional range. To add to this experience, Trends in Vogue is also working on bettering its technology-led customer interface. &ldquo;Soon we will offer online and mobile-based appointment bookings. We are developing tablet-based hair styling and colouring apps on which your photo can be uploaded and hair styling and colouring styles can be tried out virtually,&rdquo; says Ranganathan.</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Fresh look&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">Nationally, the attractiveness of the franchise proposition that Trends in Vogue offers will matter. Typically, a Green Trends salon spread over 1,200-1,500 sq ft of space in a suburban, residential neighbourhood, requires a Rs 30-40 lakh investment to start. A Limelite salon, with 1,500-2,000 sq ft in an upmarket locality, will need a Rs 60-70 lakh investment by the franchisee. All of this is in exchange for brand mileage, training and standardisation support from Trends in Vogue for an 85%-15% revenue split between the franchisee and the company. Gopalakrishnan says average monthly revenues hover at around Rs 6 lakh per salon, although premium locations can generate up to Rs 14 lakh a month. Operating margins for the salons segment are estimated between 25% and 30% according to a Ficci-PwC report titled <em>Riding the Growth Wave: Wellness 2011</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Training makes some difference too. Trends in Vogue&rsquo;s in-house training academy &mdash; with centres across Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kolkata &mdash; fusses over the perfect service provider, and hair stylists are at the top of the staff ladder. Over time, Ranganathan wants to turn his academy into an undergraduate college offering degrees in beauty care as well as styling.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;All of this depends on the group&rsquo;s ability to adequately fund its plans. &ldquo;We are looking at raising funds via bank loans and internal accruals for the current expansion. We will get to private equity later, in the second year of this expansion, unless a particularly good acquisition opportunity comes along,&rdquo; elaborates Ranganathan, who says he&rsquo;s also buying out small start-ups and chains with half a dozen outlets, which can be funded with internal accruals. &ldquo;Our ambition is to grow nationally and become the top player in the industry.&rdquo; Now, that&rsquo;s a bold bet.&nbsp;</p>', 'Trends in Vogue is taking its south-centric salon brands national.

(317, 12, '', 'Jobs, just a referral away', '<p class="p1">When 26-year-old Madhav Banerjee recently decided to shift from Mumbai to Delhi, he was looking at more than a job change; he also wanted to move out of his industry. Six months ago, Banerjee, a 2011 graduate from Chetana&rsquo;s Institute of Management &amp; Research, had landed a job with Sharp Business Systems, the Indian arm of Japanese consumer electronics major Sharp, in Mumbai. He was now keen to join the research and analytics sector. The only problem was finding the right job. Then, while on Facebook, he stumbled upon Round One, an online service that helps job seekers get referrals. &ldquo;I registered and was lucky enough to find a job in Noida,&rdquo; says Banerjee, who now works at Gyan Research and Analytics.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Round One is a job referral site started in April 2011 by Nishant Mathur, an MBA from Insead who had previously worked with Accenture in Atlanta, Delhi and Mumbai. Mathur says he was inspired to start the site from his own experience of referring someone he knew. &ldquo;A couple of years ago, I met a friend who had moved back from the US. She was looking for a job with Accenture and was more than qualified to get it. However, even after a month after applying through job portals and the company&rsquo;s website, she did not hear back from them. I then connected her to a former colleague and after he referred my friend, she got an interview call within two weeks.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">This helped Mathur realise the value of networking and personal recommendations. &ldquo;Currently, networking is serendipitous &mdash; based on who your family friends are or who you met at a party last weekend. There is no simple, transparent, quick and effective way to earn people&rsquo;s recommendations or even to network with them,&rdquo; says Mathur, who started Round One with Rs 15 lakh of his own money.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">This is how Round One&rsquo;s model works. A job seeker sends a referral request to an employee of a company he&rsquo;s interested in. If the request is accepted, he pays a fee and speaks to the employee over the phone. If the employee is satisfied with the job seeker&rsquo;s credentials, the employee refers the candidate to the HR department. Referrers generally accept to speak with about a third of the profiles that are sent to them; a job seeker is allowed to connect with the referrer over the phone only after that. Since the referrer would already have screened the job seeker&rsquo;s profile by the time they talk, 80% of the job seekers are referred after the conversation. In case they are not referred, their fee is refunded.</p>\n<p class="p4">Mathur says a recommendation increases an employee&rsquo;s chances of getting hired by as much as 10 times. &ldquo;Based on anecdotal evidence from our system, I believe that is in line with our platform as well,&rdquo; says Mathur. Employee referral programs are fast gaining ground across India Inc and many organisations reward referrers with up to two weeks&rsquo; pay upon a successful hire. Mathur cites a 2010 report by CareerBuilder, which says 69% of organisations have a formal employee referral program. &ldquo;In India, this would be slightly lower, but not very different. Almost all large companies have such programs, and the smaller ones that don&rsquo;t, still encourage employees to make referrals,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">To sweeten the deal further, Round One also gives referees Round One points, which Mathur likens to frequent flier miles. &ldquo;They are given 500 points worth Rs 100 for each person they speak to. They can be donated to charity or can be encashed in return for vouchers such as Sodexo.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">To make sure the employee is serious about referrals, Round One does background checks using a proprietary method involving both online and offline sources. Employees have to fill a feedback form after every interview giving their decision about the referral, which is shared with the job seeker as well. &ldquo;We believe in transparency between the job seeker and the employee,&rdquo; says Mathur. &ldquo;We share all the details of the employees, so the job seeker can choose the right person for referral.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">According to Mathur, Round One has over 12,000 referrers from 2,000 companies, and 400,000 job seekers registered with its service. They are mostly from the IT, banking, KPO and consultancy sectors. Round One&rsquo;s customers are typically 20-35 years old, and from tier 1 or 2 cities. &ldquo;The concept usually appeals more to those with a clear sense of the location or industry they want to be in.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p1">&nbsp;<strong>On a roll</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Round One&rsquo;s primary method of marketing so far has been social media, especially LinkedIn. In the past couple of months, the company has started search engine optimisation marketing as well. Round One earns its revenue from the one-time registration fee of Rs 100 and the additional fees (from Rs 500 to Rs 900, depending on how experienced the job seeker is) job seekers pay to interact with referrers. About 30-50% job seekers apply for more than one referral, which helps boost the company&rsquo;s income. Round One broke even in June 2012 and currently earns about Rs 8 lakh every month.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Round one- Element</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">Mathur says revenues have been growing at 25% every month. &ldquo;I see three areas for scaling up &mdash; service, business and geography,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The simplest one is geography.&rdquo; He wants to go global now, and the first stop will be the US, where he plans to launch the service in June. &ldquo;We are looking at South East Asia, England, South Africa and Australia &mdash; mostly English-speaking countries,&rdquo; he says. He&rsquo;s looking to grow his team and is also now in talks with angel investors and VC firms for funding.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">While so far, the job seeker has been paying for interactions, Round One is also exploring a model where it can get companies to sponsor interactions. &ldquo;Companies benefit from referrals as well, so we thought we will ask them to sponsor interactions,&rdquo; says Mathur. &ldquo;We are also in talks with educational institutions, who can sponsor interviews on the site for campus recruitment.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Round One is also looking at expanding the scope of its services by adding a networking platform. Sometime in the future, Mathur wants to expand the model to connect other parties in a similar fashion. &ldquo;We could connect students and universities,&rdquo; says Mathur. &ldquo;This would be networking beyond recruitment and networking beyond your network. We will launch this by the end of next year.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p1">&nbsp;<strong>Strong point</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Globally, companies like employeebuddy, referralrecruitment, jobprize and wisestep operate in the same space. Naturally, Mathur contends that their models are different from his. &ldquo;These companies are merely a bulletin board of open positions for job seekers, and a r&eacute;sum&eacute; databank for employees. They do not have a system for interactions, which is the secret sauce in the recipe. While the end result might be similar [a referral], the services offered by those companies are completely different.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">But not all HR managers have warmed up to the idea. While Sulbha Kaushal Rai, HR manager at Ernst &amp; Young agrees that the model is good, she adds that E&amp;Y already has a robust employee referral program, which contributes to 55% of its hiring needs. &ldquo;Since we are into professional services, most of our employees are chartered accountants (CAs) and MBAs,&rdquo; says Rai. &ldquo;CAs are a very close knit group. People know each other, so we have never had a shortage of referrals.&rdquo; For others, though, this may well be the new, smart way to addressing their talent woes.&nbsp;</p>', 'Online portal, Round One, gives candidate referrals a fresh twist', '30', '', 0, '', 'jobs-just-a-referral-away-317', 311, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Jobs, just a referral away', 'Online portal, round one, gives candidate referrals a fresh twist', '', '', '', 'Round One,Employee referrals', 0, NULL, '2015-01-29 18:04:27', '2015-01-29 18:15:26', '2013-05-11', 0),
(318, 16, '', 'The road less travelled', '<p class="p1">In 1904, when the first motor rally in India was organised with special permission from the viceroy, Lord Curzon, the race was about neither speed nor difficult terrain. The aim of the rally, which covered 960 km between Delhi and Bombay around Christmas that year, was simple &mdash; to test the reliability of the vehicles on Indian roads and make them popular in the country. The maharaja of Mysore, Nalwadi Krishna Raja Wadiyar, even announced a special prize for the car that arrived in Bombay in the &ldquo;smartest condition&rdquo;. Only amateur drivers could participate in the Indian Road Race and the vehicles took well-carved out routes that allowed their owners &mdash; maharajas and the ultra-rich &mdash; to show off their possessions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Fast forward nearly 110 years. Motorsports is all about tough terrains, building brands, connecting with the youth and testing vehicles to help R&amp;D. Not surprisingly, almost all companies in the automotive space &mdash; and many outside it &mdash; want to be part of the motorsports circuit in India. While JK Tyres and Maruti Suzuki are perhaps the pioneer, having been associated with the sport since the 1980s, and others such as MRF and the oil PSUs too have long associations, companies such as Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, Tata Motors and Toyota have entered the circuit as late as 2011.</p>\n<p class="p3">The association isn&rsquo;t about mere sponsorship and putting their logos on cars and drivers&rsquo; racing suits. These companies are creating a presence in motorsports either by setting up their own teams to participate in popular national and international events, or even starting their own events.</p>\n<p class="p3">Toyota&rsquo;s Etios Motor Racing, which involves driving training programmes, road shows, exhibition races and a one-make race championship is scheduled for later this year. Volkswagen flagged off the first Polo R Cup in 2010, just a few days after it unveiled the new version of the Polo. And in 2011, Tata Motors set up its motorsports division, Full Throttle to compete in existing rallies and races and organise its own off-road and motorsport activities, which will help promote the sport in India and showcase the company&rsquo;s vehicles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Then there&rsquo;s M&amp;M, which forayed into the two-wheeler market in 2009, and is using motor racing as a platform to not only develop technology, but also create awareness about its brand. In 2011, Mahindra Racing became the first Indian team to participate in the FIM MotoGP World Motorcycle Racing Championship and the Italian National Motorcycle Racing Championship the following year. &ldquo;Our participation in racing will help us develop our two-wheeler technology, significantly shortening technological learning curve. It also helps showcase our engineering and technology expertise,&rdquo; says SP Shukla, president, group strategy, and chief brand officer, M&amp;M.</p>\n<p class="p3">The reasons M&amp;M entered motorsports are precisely what led market leader Maruti Suzuki as well to foray into the segment over three decades back. &ldquo;We look at motorsports as the ultimate test of man and machine; it is a perfect fit for auto makers,&rdquo; says Mayank Pareek, managing executive officer, marketing and sales, Maruti Suzuki India. &ldquo;When you try your cars in Siachen and other tough areas, you get tremendous feedback [on the car&rsquo;s performance], which is incorporated in future products.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Maruti flagged off its flagship event, the Raid-de-Himalaya, in 1998. In addition, it also conducts other annual events such as Desert Storm, Dakshin Dare and the Young Driver Contest. Interestingly, these aren&rsquo;t one-make races &mdash; participation is open to vehicles of any make. Not surprisingly, then, the events see large turnouts. While 275 people participated in the Storm Rally in February 2013, Raid de Himalaya had 260 drivers last October. In contrast, Volkswagen&rsquo;s event is more exclusive, restricted to just 20 drivers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">As a marketing and brand-building strategy, the involvement with motorsports should strike the right chord. According to automakers&rsquo; estimates, the average age of a car buyer has come down from 46 a decade ago to 36 now. In 2007, 10% of car sales came from customers below 25 years of age. Today, about 16% of cars are bought by under-25s. The best way to reach out to this target group is through activities they enjoy and that includes motorsports &mdash; of Formula One&rsquo;s viewership of 550 million across the world, about 30 million are estimated to be Indians. And the average age of participants in amateur motorsport events is 34.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The Indian Grand Prix has certainly helped. &ldquo;Bringing F1 to India has created a new level of interest in motorsports and automakers are leveraging that,&rdquo; agrees Karun Chandhok, racing driver and motorsports consultant.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">No company is willing to say how much it is investing in motorsports, but Chandhok says the biggest investment is typically in the car hardware &mdash; making the vehicles ready for racing. &ldquo;Companies have to make extra investment in safety systems, roll cage, make modifications to the engine, gear boxes and suspension and use special tyres for racing vehicles.&rdquo; For example, an Etios that costs #5 lakh on road can go up to #6.5 lakh when customised for the race track.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Compared with the returns generated, most companies believe the expenditure on motorsports is money well spent. &ldquo;It provides a platform for customer engagement and association with the brand, which makes it worthwhile to invest in it,&rdquo; sums up Pareek.&nbsp;</p>', 'Motorsports is the new brand building and feedback tool for auto majors', '33', '', 0, '', 'the-road-less-travelled-318', 312, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'The road less travelled ', 'Motorsports is the new brand building and feedback tool for auto majors', '', '', '', 'Motorsports,Motor racing', 0, NULL, '2015-01-29 18:17:33', '2015-01-29 18:24:41', '2013-05-11', 0),
(319, 16, '', 'Polished performance', '<p class="p1">Robotic machines zip up and down an uncomfortably hot and deserted factory floor, transporting finished tiles from one end to the other. The machines flip out 70,000 sq m of tiles every day and stack them with a precision no human can match. The location: Kajaria Ceramics&rsquo; tile manufacturing unit at Gailpur near Bhiwadi, Rajasthan. Around 900 of Kajaria&rsquo;s 1,500-odd employees work full time in three shifts, operating machines and in maintenance, administration and accounts. Another 600 are contracted for work such as loading of finished goods, unloading of raw materials and other allied jobs.</p>\n<p class="p3">Set up in 1998 with an investment of Rs 442 crore, the Bhiwadi plant is Kajaria&rsquo;s only facility that is fully automated. Kajaria Ceramics began operations in 1988 with a technical collaboration with Spain&rsquo;s Todagres, the world&rsquo;s second-largest tile maker. Those days, the first unit in Sikandrabad, Uttar Pradesh, could produce about 1 million sq m of floor tiles in a year. Today, the Rs 1,300-crore company is India&rsquo;s largest producer of ceramic and vitrified tiles with an annual installed capacity of 41 million sq m across five facilities &mdash; Sikandrabad (Uttar Pradesh); Gailpur (Rajasthan); Vijaywada (Andhra Pradesh); and two in Morbi (Gujarat).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>At the top of the heap- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In a largely unorganised industry estimated at Rs 17,000 crore and growing at a CAGR of 15%, Kajaria has managed to emerge as the second-largest player in the Rs 8,500-crore organised tiles segment with a 16% share, after H&amp;R Johnson (part of the Rajan Raheja Group, which owns <em>Outlook Business</em>). High demand for vitrified tiles over the past five years from major cities has helped Kajaria clock sales CAGR of 25%. Much of this has to do with the publicly-listed company&rsquo;s calibrated approach to building its business.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Building blocks</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Meet chief operating officer Rajveer Chaudhary, who has been with the company for 15 years. He believes the secret sauce in Kajaria&rsquo;s success story is the attention it paid to evolving consumer preference from ceramic to vitrified tiles, and in penetrating tier 2 cities. Vitrified tiles &mdash; made by the addition of quartz and feldspar &mdash; are more durable than ceramic glazed tiles. They fetch more profits too. More importantly, vitrified tiles carry higher operating margins of 16-17% compared with 14-15% for ceramic tiles.</p>\n<p class="p3">To begin with, Kajaria started importing vitrified tiles from China, Spain and Italy. This move was backed by massive brand building and an advertising blitzkrieg across TV channels beginning 2004 to create enough visibility in the market. As demand kicked in for its branded vitrified tales, the management undertook a capex programme in FY09 to increase manufacturing capacity. It set up an 8,000 sq m a day unit in UP and then a second plant in Rajasthan with a capacity of 18,000 sq m a day for glazed and polished vitrified tiles. Today, of its total capacity of 41 million sq m, vitrified tile capacity is 16.8 million sq m &mdash; an eight-fold increase in three years. But all of it was not organic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Cutting edge- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Seizing on the opportunity of working in a largely unorganised industry, the company acquired marginal players that lacked strong brand support or distribution network. Over the past couple of years, it picked up majority stakes in four small and mid-sized companies based in Gujarat and South India for Rs 37.12 crore. It acquired a 51% stake for Rs 11.61 crore in Morbi-based Cosa Ceramics, which manufactures double-charged vitrified tiles, with a capacity to produce 6,000 boxes (or 8,000 sq m) of vitrified tiles per day. Kajaria also bought 51% in Hyderabad-based Vennar Ceramics for Rs 13.65 crore. Vennar is at an advanced stage of setting up a plant to manufacture 2.30 million sq m per annum of high-end ceramic wall tiles, the addition of which will take the total annual capacity of the company to 38.30 million sq m (including 10 million sq m capacity of its subsidiaries). Another 51% stake was acquired in Gujarat&rsquo;s Jaxx Vitrified for Rs 6.26 crore. Jaxx comes with an annual capacity to produce 3.10 million sq m of polished vitrified tiles. The 51% stake in Soriso Ceramic for #5.60 crore fetches Kajaria a further capacity of 2.30 million sq m of rectified ceramic floor tiles a year. Rectified ceramic tiles are mechanically finished on all sides to achieve uniform size and optimum precision, and are typically larger tiles, used along with small tiles to create patterned designs. &ldquo;In Gujarat, tile manufacturers are good at making products but they are not good at marketing,&rdquo; Chaudhary explains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Kajaria has been quite active in judging demand in the market and acting accordingly,&rdquo; agrees Ishpreet Bindra, an analyst with Sushil Finance. &ldquo;Instead of expanding its own capacity it started acquiring companies and besides importing a certain amount of high-end tiles, which it sells here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Manufacturing prowess was then backed by an expansive distribution network. Over the past decade, Kajaria doubled its network to 660 dealers and 5,000 smaller sub-dealers. Today, it has a strong presence in the north, which contributes 42% to revenues; the south contributes 29% and the balance comes from the west and east zones. According to analysts, the strategy of adding dealers in a relatively slow manner since 2002, compared with peers, has had a positive impact. &ldquo;The network is distributed in such a way that it leads to lower cannibalisation, thus limiting undercutting and does not lead to the dilution of the Kajaria brand,&rdquo; state Dolat Capital&rsquo;s&nbsp; analysts Nehal Shah and Mahvash Ariyanfar in a report.</p>\n<p class="p3">Continuous product innovation has helped too. &ldquo;Kajaria focuses on innovation in designs and concepts. We believe they introduce new designs and variants almost every day and at any given point in time, have more variety than any other player, making it a unique selling point,&rdquo; states the report. &ldquo;We introduce about 100 designs in wall and floor tiles every year. At present we have 650 designs in wall and 300 in floor tiles,&rdquo; points out Chaudhary.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Sprinting ahead- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Besides, the company also placed emphasis on customer experience. Kajaria World and Galaxy showrooms display tile samples, and mock bathrooms and kitchens in various combinations. So far, 52 such showrooms of 2,500-4,000 sq ft size have opened in metros and smaller towns, of which 20 are company owned and the rest are franchisees. &ldquo;Kajaria World showrooms are on franchise and Galaxy showrooms are owned by dealers and they contribute a higher share to our revenue than normal dealers. Besides our own 22 showrooms display a wide range of our&nbsp; products,&rdquo; adds Chaudhary. This presence is significant since retail accounts for 80% of sales volumes, with the balance coming from real estate developers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Treading smartly</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Over the past three years (FY09-FY12), Kajaria has seen revenue and operating CAGR of 25% and 30%, respectively, with equal share of revenue contribution coming from ceramic and vitrified tiles. More impressively, profits have grown at a CAGR of 109%, largely backed by strong working capital management, rising cash flows and consequent reduction in debt. Still, some challenges remain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Rising fuel prices are a lingering concern for tiles manufacturers, and Kajaria is no exception. Natural gas, the largest cost component for Kajaria, accounted for 19% of overall expenses in FY12. Despite holding out to cost pressures in the past, in Q3FY13, the company&rsquo;s operating profit margin declined by two percentage points to 14.61% because of higher fuel costs. &ldquo;The price of natural gas in India has doubled in the last two years from Rs 15 to Rs 30 per standard cubic metre. In China, most factories use coal gas, which is much cheaper than natural gas,&rdquo; says Chaudhary.</p>\n<p class="p3">But despite cost increases, consolidated revenues grew 24% to Rs 1,162 crore and profits 28% to Rs74 crore for the nine months ended December 2012. This was due to savings made on interest costs, after repaying outstanding debt. Currently, the company has manageable debt of Rs 225 crore on its books. A large part of Kajaria&rsquo;s financial performance has been driven by its move to scale up the value chain and reduce dependence on imports of vitrified tiles, high-end tiles and sanitary ware. For instance, trading sales &mdash; the sale of imported tiles, in trade parlance &mdash; bring lower margins of 10% against 20% in own manufactured products. The company is adopting a similar strategy in high-margin value-added products such as sanitary wares. Currently, it imports wares from Vitra in Turkey. In FY13, the brand contributed Rs 20 crore in revenues and but now the company is setting up a manufacturing plant in Gujarat through a joint venture to produce sanitary wares.</p>\n<p class="p3">By moving up the value chain, Kajaria has managed to counter competition from the unorganised sector. Morbi, the largest ceramic tile hub in the country, along with Kadi and Himmat Nagar in Gujarat, is the ceramic tiles hub of India with 450 units. Chaudhary explains that it is hard to compete with these units because they operate at lower cost and, hence, sell at lower prices. Instead, Kajaria is banking on its strong distribution network and premium products that account for more than 70% of its revenues to spur growth. Volumes are expected to rise as Kajaria seeks greener pastures (read: new markets). &ldquo;Our overall margins will not come down as we keep penetrating newer semi-urban and smaller cities,&rdquo; points out Chaudhary. Currently, tier 2 and 3 cities contribute 25-30% to the company&rsquo;s topline.</p>\n<p class="p3">The bogey of Chinese imports is gone after anti-dumping duty was introduced by India. That&rsquo;s another positive factor in Kajaria&rsquo;s favour. While the cyclical nature of real estate business continues to be an important determinant of sales, Chaudhary maintains there&rsquo;s no slowdown in demand, at least for now. &ldquo;There is always some kind of home renovation going on and our proportion of sales to developers is still nascent [20%], so we are not too worried.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">For now, Kajaria wants to consolidate its operations and build on its existing strengths. There are no capacity addition plans afoot even as the company looks to wrap up the acquisition of Oozy Vitrified in Gujarat, which has an annual capacity of 7,000 sq m.

(321, 20, '', 'Spectacular bust', '<p class="p1">Stats on star investors usually show how they&rsquo;ve beaten the market or highlight their one rockstar stock. Talk about Big Bull, aka Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, too, usually centres on his legendary picks such as Titan and Crisil. But there is one investment bet in his 26-stock portfolio that has gone bust, spectacularly.</p>\n<p class="p3">In 2006, Jhunjhunwala paid Rs 20-odd crore for a 21% stake in A2Z Maintenance &amp; Engineering Services, an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) company engaged in power distribution and facility management services (FMS) among other interests. In 2010, it went public, raising Rs 776 crore (fresh issue of Rs 675 crore and offer for sale of Rs &nbsp;101.25 crore). Under the offer for sale, Jhunjhunwala sold over 1 million shares at Rs 400 a share, pocketing over Rs 40 crore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But the gains evaporated on the very first day, when the stock tanked on listing. To soothe frayed nerves, Big Bull bought 1.375 million shares at Rs 350.77 a share, forking out Rs 48 crore. At the end of the quarter his 19.11% stake was still worth a respectable Rs 450 crore. But the stock continued to head southward. Again on May 22, 2012, Jhunjhunwala bought 2.65 million shares for Rs 26 crore at Rs 100 a share, thus pumping in an additional Rs 75 crore in the company and raising his stake to 22.68%.</p>\n<p class="p3">Today, in just two years, the stock has come off 94% to Rs 19.45 as on April 18, against a 4% fall in Sensex. Though Jhunjhunwala sold part of his stake in March, at 18% he is the biggest non-promoter shareholder and the stock remains the biggest bet, in percentage holding terms, within his portfolio. But its value is now a paltry Rs 25 crore.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Tripping over- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">What went wrong with A2Z? For starters, it bit off more than it could chew, starting off as an FMS provider and moving on to installing power distribution lines and sub-stations. However, with power distribution a shambles, the sector was de-rated by the Street. Besides, A2Z allocated a chunk of the IPO proceeds for its biomass plants of 60 MW, but has been facing delays in execution and signing power purchase agreements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While analysts had panned the IPO for its aggressive multiples [26 times, against the then-industry multiple of 15x for EPC companies], what raised eyebrows was how profit and margins plummeted dramatically post listing. From a profit of Rs 93 crore in FY10, prior to listing, A2Z posted a Rs 19 crore loss in FY12. And for the nine months of FY13, the loss widened to Rs 25 crore on sales of Rs 436 crore. To top it all, the company&rsquo;s debt piled up from Rs 405 crore to over Rs 1,100 crore as of FY12.</p>\n<p class="p3">The Street sensed something was amiss when Jhunjhunwala stepped down as director in late 2012 and also pulled out his nominee director, Manish Gupta, early this year. Rajeev Thakore, an independent director, too resigned from the board and earlier, in 2012, the company&rsquo;s group CFO too quit to become a &lsquo;financial advisor&rsquo; to&nbsp;the company.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Still, retail investors piled into A2Z &mdash; perhaps thinking they were getting a stock with a marquee investor cheap &mdash; and their numbers doubled from 12,000-odd as of December 2010 to over 24,000 by March 2013. Last heard, the management referred the company to the corporate debt restructuring cell. It remains to be seen whether A2Z gets bailed out.

(322, 20, '', 'Making a splash', '<p class="p1">In 1996, Rajiv Mittal left London and came to Chennai to set up the Indian office of the company he worked for. Eight years later, when the Indian operation was put on the block, Mittal and three executive directors of the company decided to make a bid. Management buyouts are still a rare occurrence in India &mdash; and buyouts of Indian arms of MNCs almost unheard-of. But, in September 2005, with some help from ICICI Ventures, the quartet bought 75% of the company they worked for, paying Rs 60 crore. A year after Mittal decided to try his hand at the unthinkable &mdash; he made a bid to acquire the parent company in Austria. Again helped by the PE firm, he succeeded and the deal was completed in 2007.</p>\n<p class="p3">Just what company are we talking about? It&rsquo;s the Chennai-headquartered VA Tech Wabag, a Rs 1,400-crore tech firm that&rsquo;s carving a niche for itself in the water treatment business, offering solutions for sewage treatment, industrial waste water treatment, drinking water treatment, desalination and water reuse, to clients across government and industry. It also has ambitions of establishing itself as one of the top three players globally in the water business (currently, VA Tech is in the top eight). The company has given a guidance of growing revenue to &euro;1 billion (Rs 7,100 crore) by 2017 &mdash; a four-fold increase in as many years. Of this, nearly half will come from the Indian market, 25% from overseas business and the rest through acquisitions. Can it achieve all that? That&rsquo;s the billion-euro question.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>At home and abroad</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">According to EverythingAboutWater, the total Indian water market is estimated at about $15 billion, while the water and wastewater treatment market size is about $420 million; both are growing at 18% a year. Another report, this one by the Water Resource Group, estimates that about half the country&rsquo;s water demand will go unmet by 2030 if existing conditions continue. Nearly 75% of India&rsquo;s population lives in water-stressed areas. So, it comes as no surprise that the Indian government is focusing on improving water infrastructure through its landmark schemes under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), where 20% of the total spend is earmarked for capacity addition. VA Tech, with a presence across the water spectrum, is in a position to take advantage of this. At home, the company competes with domestic players such as Thermax, Ion Exchange and Hindustan Dorr Oliver, as well as international rivals such as Veolia, Suez and Degremont. But it does have a couple of advantages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">First, the takeover of its parent gave VA Tech access to cutting edge technology, with over 100 patents. &ldquo;This is one of the clear differentiators,&rdquo; agrees Mittal, the managing director. Also, the company is present across the water spectrum unlike, say, Thermax, Ion Exchange and Driplex, which compete only in the industrial water segment, while Degremont and Enviro Control are present mainly in the waste water segment. That&rsquo;s helped the company increase the contribution to total revenue from Indian business from 58% to 66%, between FY09 and FY12.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>World wide wet - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">On the international platform, its pedigree has helped the company win projects in over 20 countries across North Africa, Europe and Asia where it can play the low-cost advantage card <em>(see: World wide wet)</em>. VA Tech consciously follows an asset-light model, focusing on design and engineering in the projects it undertakes while outsourcing the majority of its construction jobs. About 81% of its business comes from engineering-procurement-construction (EPC) services, while operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) accounts for the balance.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>A salt-free diet</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Now, the biggest opportunity, believes the management, lies in desalination. By 2018, VA Tech estimates, desalination capacity in India will be around 5,350 million litres a day (mld) having grown at 30% a year from the current 900 mld. It recently completed its biggest desalination project till date, the Rs 1,100-crore Nemmeli plant in Chennai, which will supply 100 mld every day to Chennai residents, taking care of 10-12% of the city&rsquo;s requirement. While VA Tech has earned Rs 530 crore for the design and construction of the project, it also has an O&amp;M contract for the plant, which will generate another Rs 500 crore over a seven-year period.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Although there were some delays in the Nemmeli project, the company has been able to use it to springboard its way to more projects. In 2010, VA Tech entered into an alliance with Sumitomo Corporation to compete for large water infrastructure projects. The consortium won a $350 million project to build a 192 mld desalination plant in Muscat, Oman. VA Tech&rsquo;s share of the project, which is likely to be completed in the next two years, will be around Rs 400 crore.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>The fourth wave- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Recently, the Tamil Nadu government also announced two more desalination plants. While a 150 mld plant will come up next to the existing one at Nemmeli, another will be set up at Pattipulam near Chennai with a capacity of 200 mld that can be increased to 400 mld. Analysts believe VA Tech will be at an advantage when bidding opens on the projects, since it has already built the largest plant in the country. In fact, the company is likely to be one of the major beneficiaries of even the central government&rsquo;s increasing investments in water supply and waste water treatment&nbsp; (<em>see: The fourth wave</em>). &ldquo;The sector is so attractive and it is up to us and our ability to harness the growth opportunities,&rdquo; says Mittal.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Order, order</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">At the end of December 2012, VA Tech had an impressive order book of Rs 4,269 crore, but the slowdown has had an impact, with orders taking longer to come by. &ldquo;There has been some slowdown but we have managed to get our share of the pie. We may have had to work harder for it but we will achieve the order book growth we had promised for FY13,&rdquo; says Mittal confidently. At the beginning of FY13, the company has indicated an order book growth of 20% for FY13. It is looking at a similar growth for FY14. The company is also confident of achieving its full-year revenue guidance of Rs 1,650-1,700 crore with operating margins of 9-9.5%. That&rsquo;s lower than the industry average of 10-10.5% and in defence, the company points to high-cost overseas subsidiaries, which it says it has since turned around. Now, VA Tech is looking to build up volumes for margins to improve further. Besides, Mittal points out, margins on the standalone business are at 12.5-13%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Delays are a concern but they are also all too common in the project business. Where projects involving the government may at times run into hurdles in getting approvals or funds released, even natural phenomena such as a heavy monsoon can stop work for up to a couple of months at a time. In some cases, VA Tech has itself funded the project to ensure timely completion &mdash; the Nemmeli project is a case in point, although now some 70% of the design and construction cost has been paid to the company by the Tamil Nadu government. &ldquo;Delays lead to cost escalation, resulting in lower margins. Our customers have the willingness to pay but, at times, may not have the ability. So, we put in our cash to complete the projects,&rdquo; explains Mittal.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Aqua fresh - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">This is where the company&rsquo;s strong balance sheet and cash reserves of about Rs 350 crore come to its aid. &ldquo;Unlike many EPC companies that come with stressed balance sheets, VA Tech&rsquo;s asset light business model ensures that the company remains cash rich and that works to its advantage,&rdquo; points out Nitin Bhasin, infrastructure analyst at Ambit Capital.</p>\n<p class="p3">VA Tech is also becoming careful in the kind of projects it chooses. Since chances of delay in execution as well as payment are higher in municipal and state government projects, it prefers multi-laterally funded and central government initiatives. &ldquo;The company works in a space where most of the payments are made by the government or government entities and dealing with them can be very challenging. But it has done well on that front,&rdquo; praises Jerry Rao, founder of Mphasis and a director on the VA Tech board. Indeed, as there has been some lag in government spending in India, the contribution of the domestic industrial business is now about 45-50% of revenue, while the government business contributes 50-55% compared with earlier when government business contributed about 75%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Meanwhile, when there has been a slowdown of orders in some of VA Tech&rsquo;s otherwise-strong markets, such as Libya and Algeria, due to political unrest in 2011, the company has turned its focus to newer markets such as Turkey, Sri Lanka and West Asia. &ldquo;Having a diverse presence across countries works in its favour because when one economy is a facing a downturn, you can focus on other markets to generate growth,&rdquo; says Sumit Chandwani, managing partner, Arth Capital. Chandwani was with ICICI Ventures when it invested in VA Tech and played an instrumental role in both its takeovers. He continues as an independent director on the company&rsquo;s board.</p>\n<p class="p3">Over a five-year period (2007-2012), the company&rsquo;s revenues have grown by an average 34% and profits have grown by 61%. During the nine months ended December 2012, revenues grew by 20% to Rs 925.5 crore and profits more than doubled to Rs 29.6 crore. Ambit&rsquo;s Bhasin feels that, given the growth trajectory of the company, its current valuations are attractive. &ldquo;The company&rsquo;s revenue growth trajectory from mid-teens is likely to shift higher to 20% during the next two years. Given that the stock trades at 11-12x its FY14 earnings, we think it is very attractive,&rdquo; he adds. Over the past one year (as April 22, 2013), VA Tech&rsquo;s stock has gained 16%, outperforming the Sensex during that period. The company is also well-poised to gain from the increased spending in water infrastructure, sewage and waste water management in emerging markets. With Mittal eyeing &euro;1 billion in revenues in the next four to five years, most analysts are bullish on the stock on account of the strong management team, increasing investments in the sector and execution track record of the company. Bhasin has a price target of #750 on the stock, which currently trades at #492. With the odds in its favour, it definitely seems worth a bet.&nbsp;</p>', 'A strong balance sheet and cheap valuation seem to work in favour of water treatment major, VA Tech Wabag', '6', '', 0, '', 'making-a-splash-322', 316, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Making a splash', 'A strong balance sheet and cheap valuation seem to work in favour of water treatment major, VA Tech Wabag', '', '', '', 'Water treatment,VA Tech Wabag', 0, NULL, '2015-01-29 19:01:18', '2015-01-29 19:11:26', '2013-05-11', 0);

Grocery products from Great Value, with brands such as Equate (pharmacy), Mainstay (low-cost furniture and bedding), Ol&rsquo;Roy (dog food), Dr Thunder (soft drink) and Parent&rsquo;s Choice (baby products) bring in close to 40% of the big-box retailer&rsquo;s revenues of $421 billion. Similarly, UK-based retail giant Tesco earns 50% of its &pound;64 billion revenue from private brands. Its two private labels Tesco Value and Tesco Finest are worth &pound;1 billion each.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With margins as high as 20% in FMCG categories and 40% in apparel, private labels are the mainstay of retailers worldwide. These similar quality and low-priced alternatives to regular manufacturer brands not only draw consumers into stores, they help improve revenues and drive up profitability for retailers. According to market research agency Nielsen, private labels contribute 17% to retailers&rsquo; revenues in the US, UK and France. In India, that figure is closer to 7% of organised retail sales (which itself is just 7% of total retail).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">To be fair, private labels have made their mark already, but only up to a point. The Rs 10,000 crore-crore retail giant Future Group, owned by Kishore Biyani, generates Rs 200 crore in revenues from them. Almost 20% of the FMCG business of the group&rsquo;s flagship value format, Big Bazaar comes from its in-house brands such as Cleanmate and Sach. In soups, about 25% of sales come from its brand, Tasty Treat. Other leading chains such as Mukesh Ambani&rsquo;s Reliance Retail and Harsh Goenka&rsquo;s Spencer&rsquo;s have long been focusing on private labels too. Over 200 stock keeping units (SKUs) of Walmart&rsquo;s Great Value are available at its Easy Day stores in India. And one can see a significant presence of Tesco Value brands at the Tata Group&rsquo;s Star Bazaar. Nearly 22% of the merchandise at K Raheja Group&rsquo;s HyperCity, too, comprises its own brands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But in the absence of scale, inadequate brand building and the effects of a slowdown in consumer spending, Indian retail&rsquo;s private label story has yet to take off from its modest levels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Too many odds</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">In fact, only few experts are upbeat about private labels making a significant difference to the business anytime soon. &ldquo;The reason for that is none of the retail companies (barring Future Group) generate adequate volumes to invest in large number of private labels,&rdquo; says Ankur Bisen, associate vice-president (retail and consumer products) at retail consultancy Technopak.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">He&rsquo;s right. Walmart has over 8,000 stores across 26 countries, while Tesco has about 3,000 stores across formats in the UK alone. In comparison, India&rsquo;s largest retail company, Future Group, has 240-odd stores of Big Bazaar, while hypermarket chain HyperCity has just 13 stores. In the apparel retail space, the largest player, Future Group&rsquo;s Pantaloon has 70-odd stores, while K Raheja-owned Shoppers&rsquo; Stop has 50 stores.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The recipe for success in private labels is scale leading to high volumes and, hence, higher margins and better profitability. &ldquo;But in a $500 billion retail market, where organised retail constitutes only $35 billion, it is difficult to generate volumes,&rdquo; says Bisen. Raghu Viswanath, MD of brand valuation and consultancy, Vertebrand, points out that most Indian retailers haven&rsquo;t invested in their private brands. &ldquo;Retail brands in India have done little in building equity of their store brands,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If you go to buy biscuits, there are more chances of you picking up a pack of Parle or Britannia biscuits rather than the store brand, simply because you are not too sure of the quality of the store brand.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Stock disposal becomes a huge concern with private labels" - Punit Agarwal, managing director, Promart</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The other stumbling block for Indian retailers as far as private brands are concerned is mounting inventory costs (especially in apparel retail). &ldquo;Stock disposal becomes a huge concern with private labels, resulting in high inventory costs,&rdquo; says Punit Agarwal, managing director of discount retail apparel format, Promart. &ldquo;In a low volume business, it makes more sense to buy merchandise from brands on consignment basis,&rdquo; he adds. In the consignment model, the retailer stocks SKUs of a particular brand for around two-three months, and if an SKU fails to generate sales, the retailer has the option of returning it. Promart has four private label brands, manufactured by its sister concern, Vemb International. For now, Agarwal has no plans of expanding his portfolio. &ldquo;Since my private labels are manufactured by our sister-concern, we only manufacture to our stores requirements. Unless the volumes of sales really increases, I don&rsquo;t see the need to increase our private label contribution.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Three years ago, Shoppers Stop too cut down its private labels from 20% to 10%. &ldquo;In the private label business, it is scale economy that works. The gross margins may be as high as 30-35% (in apparel), but it is highly capital intensive. The inventory costs are high and unless there is scale, it will be difficult to sustain,&rdquo; points out Abneesh Roy, associate director, institutional equities (research) at Edelweiss. He has a point. One reason for Vishal Retail&rsquo;s downfall was its private labels-only apparel strategy and, consequently, dangerously high inventory levels.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Will FDI help?</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">While FDI in retail may bring in more capital into the business, it&rsquo;s unlikely to boost the retail business at least in the short to medium term. &ldquo;We are unable to take our private label business to the next level only because we don&rsquo;t have volumes. I don&rsquo;t see FDI bringing about a huge change,&rdquo; explains Mark Ashman, chief executive officer, HyperCity.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"I do not see foreign direct investment bringing about a huge change" - Mark Ashman, chief executive officer, HyperCity</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Govind Shrikhande, managing director, Shoppers Stop, says the success of store brands hinges on consumer maturity, the quality of private label development and&nbsp;retailers price positioning. &ldquo;FDI and private labels are not related. A multi-brand retailer in luxury or bridge to luxury positioning would always maintain a lower private label ratio, whereas a mass retailer would continue to increase the private label share,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"A store brand''s success relies on the retailer''s price positioning" - Govind Shrikhande, managing director, Shoppers Stop</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Retail industry experts don&rsquo;t see the current modern retail contribution of 7% going beyond 20% in the next 10 years. &ldquo;It will take at least three-four years before store expansions happen and for retailers to actually invest in a robust private label business,&rdquo; points out Roy. The reason for the slow growth is again to do with the policies. &ldquo;There are several issues such as high real estate, high sourcing costs, labour laws, etc that needed to be sorted out in order to fuel growth,&rdquo; points out Bisen of Technopak.</p>\n<p class="p3">While private labels bring in higher revenues and profitability in the long run, the question being asked is how committed are retailers to their private label business at a time when their core business is floundering. &ldquo;Most Indian retailers are yet to understand the dynamics of the market,&rdquo; says Santosh Stephen, managing director of Symega Savoury Technology that makes table top seasonings, spice blends and soup mixes for chains such as Reliance Retail, Star Bazaar, Hypercity and More. &ldquo;Till about 2008-2009, their growth trajectory was positive and encouraging. However, since then there has been a steep decline in volumes and the number of outlets opened. The volumes forecast never materialised,&rdquo; he adds. Located at Pancode in Kerala&rsquo;s Ernakulam district, Symega makes 10% of its annual revenues of Rs 65 crore (FY13) from private label supplies in India.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;&ldquo;Retailers are yet to come to size and scale to start thinking about private labels,&rdquo; says Nikhil Sen, CEO, Unibic, which supplies cookies and other confectionary products to retailers such as Big Bazaar and Reliance Retail, among others. &ldquo;We have had instances where inventories were returned as the retailers were not able to gauge demand correctly. I expect this segment to grow in future as it has done in the West. But modern retail has to first turn profitable and get scale.&rdquo; Currently, the Rs 150-odd crore cookie manufacturer gets close to 15% of its revenues from contract manufacturing.</p>\n<p class="p3">In India, vendors that manufacture private labels are usually SMEs that lack capabilities to supply to retailers nationally, unlike the ones in the US and the UK, which churn out revenues of $10-12 billion. Vertebrand&rsquo;s&nbsp; Vishwanath says Indian contract manufacturers operate on limited quality standards or supply-chain capabilities. &ldquo;Once global retailers come in, it is unlikely that they will source from them. A large scale consolidation will be on the cards. Only the bigger ones will remain in business, the smaller ones will either get acquired or will fold up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While private labels are undoubtedly the way forward for modern retail in India, like elsewhere, the jury is still out how an evolving retail sector buffeted by the effects of the economic slowdown and spiralling costs, will address this challenge. Will Big Bazaar&rsquo;s Tasty Treat Noodles ever outsell Nestle&rsquo;s Maggi? Will Tasty Treat ever make it to the &pound;1 billion club like Tesco Value?

So we decided to focus on this segment,&rdquo; says Dalmia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>The right fit</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">In 2001, the business grew enough for the company to open a second manufacturing unit, and two more facilities soon after, investing around Rs 45 crore. In 2007, Prateek acquired the garment making units of Hubli Apparels, adding capacity of 125,000 shirts/trousers a month. The same year, Sidbi Venture Capital invested Rs 30 crore in Prateek. Now, it has over 6,000 employees across six manufacturing facilities, making over 7.2 million pieces of garment a year. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Dalmia says Prateek&rsquo;s distinctiveness is in the design-to-delivery solution it brings to the market. &ldquo;We have a 50-member (textile, graphic and fashion designers) design management company called Munch that researches market trends in fabrics, trends and accessories, designs and develops them.&rdquo; Started in 2004, Munch is headed by a separate CEO and is run as an independent business, servicing outside clients such as the Taj Group, Royal Enfield and DIAL, among others, in areas like uniform and packaging design, communication and brand design.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">This kind of end-to-end product development and delivery support is what private labels typically seek from their suppliers. Prateek caters to retailers such as Pantaloon and Lifestyle for their store brands at present and Dalmia is confident this business will grow as more&nbsp; retail chains find value in creating and selling their own brands. &ldquo;Every retailer is facing problems like high rentals and manpower costs, and even [manufacturer] brands are not making money. So, simply from the point of making more margins and profits, retailers have to sell private labels,&rdquo; he says. Retail experts concur that on average Indian garment retailers stand to make 20-25% more selling private labels than other brands. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Testing times</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Dalmia reckons it will be a good three-four years before private labels really take off in India, pointing out that India still has very few big apparel retailers. But he insists that fashion is among the segments best suited for modern retailers to launch their own brands. &ldquo;Fashion is more elastic than food,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Sometimes, customers do not even check the brand. If it looks attractive and is being sold at a store they trust, people buy the clothes.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">For manufacturers, though, progressively thinning margins &mdash; currently in the 5-10% range &mdash;and lack of scale among retailers make this business difficult to be in, right now. &ldquo;Clients ask for impossible margins. We have had to break relationships with some in the past, because of this,&rdquo; says Dalmia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">The pressure on margins is showing up in the bottomline &mdash; a net profit of Rs 20 lakh for the six months ended September 30, 2012, on an operating income of Rs 153.7 crore, compared with Rs 2.5 crore on an operating income of Rs 377.5 crore for all of FY12 (source: Icra). That could be cause for worry but Dalmia says some course correction is on the way.</p>\n<p class="p3">Until the next round of retail expansion happens and volumes go up, exports will remain the focus, especially the high-margin premium garments segment where Prateek&rsquo;s design-led integrated model scores well. For the private label business too, Dalmia plans to take a similar approach. &ldquo;Exporters from countries such as Bangladesh already sell to mass market brands like Tesco and Walmart. We want to focus on more premium [global] brands like, say, Debenhams and Target,&rdquo; he says. Raghu Viswanath, founder of Vertebrand Management Consulting, a brand valuation and consultancy firm, agrees that Indian garment manufacturers are better placed to cater to the premium segment that requires more design inputs and value-adds. &ldquo;Players like Prateek will benefit if they can tap the mid to top end of the market,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>A new yarn</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Online sales are another platform that Dalmia hopes will contribute significantly in the future. Right now, the company&rsquo;s own brands such as Locomotive, Hylander and Black Coffee already sell on e-commerce sites such as Jabong and Myntra but the numbers are small. In March 2013, Icra upgraded Prateek&rsquo;s credit rating from B to BB-, making a positive note of the company&rsquo;s e-retail presence and new customer additions in the export market (it had downgraded the company a year earlier for its stretched liquidity position). Viswanath says that while there are many companies in India in the contract manufacture space such as Indus Clothing and Indian Design, Prateek&rsquo;s global supplier status should give it an extra edge in the business.</p>\n<p class="p3">The company had plans of doubling capacity with a seventh unit at Tumkur (70 km from Bengaluru) on 28 acres of land with about Rs 80 crore investment, and had acquired land for this in 2008. But the economic slowdown had put things on hold. Bilteek, its joint venture with Turkey&rsquo;s Bilsar in 2011, added fresh capacity of 260,000 pieces a month. Dalmia says more capacity can be added now, if the need arises. With more brands entering the market and the Indian consumer tuning into global trends, he says design and finish will become more critical in the future and retailers will have to go the extra mile to catch the customer&rsquo;s eye. &ldquo;When they do, Prateek will be among those best suited to cater to their needs with our unique design and manufacturing strengths,&rdquo; he smiles.</p>', 'Prateek Apparel''s design-to-delivery model appeals to retailers, but maintaining margins is a struggle', '29', '', 0, '', 'made-to-order-324', 318, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Made to order', 'Prateek Apparel''s design-to-delivery model appeals to retailers, but maintaining margins is a struggle', '', '', '', 'Prateek Apparel''s,Phulchand Exports', 0, NULL, '2015-01-30 11:12:26', '2015-01-30 11:19:20', '2013-05-11', 0),
(325, 20, '', 'A taste of things to come', '<p class="p1">I can do a blind tasting and tell you the tomato ketchup brand,&rdquo; says Vijay C, director of Bengaluru-based Indira Foods. He&rsquo;s pointing to the stack of tomato ketchup bottles and packets arranged neatly on his table along with an assortment of processed food packets. After all, tomato ketchup was Vijay&rsquo;s first offering when he set up a few machines in 2001 to sell to local hotels and food services clients.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Today, Indira Foods makes tomato and tamarind paste, tomato ketchup, pickles and jams, and ready-to-cook <em>dosa</em> batter for in-store brands of retailers such as Future Group&rsquo;s Food Bazaar, Aditya Birla group&rsquo;s More and Auchan (formerly, Spar), and institutional clients such as Pizza Hut, and also sells them under its own brands, Splitz and Indira&rsquo;s. It is also the biggest exporter of tamarind concentrate from India, selling close to 1,500 tonne of the sour pulp, annually. Of this production, 50% is exported to countries in West Asia, the US, Europe and Australia as a bulk supplier.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Private labels bring in nearly a third of Indira&rsquo;s revenues. Sales from Vijay&rsquo;s own brands make for about 10% of the business. Exports contribute 20% while the rest comes from bulk buyers in the food services industry. Sales of Splitz tomato ketchup and paste, and tamarind concentrate have been growing, though mainly in South India. &ldquo;We currently sell it in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh and plan to expand to more states,&rdquo; informs Vijay.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Indira Foods - Element&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Vijay launched the firm when he was a full-time student union worker in his late 20s, with a seed capital of Rs 12 lakh. &ldquo;We took a loan from the bank and bought a few machines. My brother too had a similar business so I had some idea about the business,&rdquo; he says. As demand increased, he took up more loans, amounting to Rs 3.6 crore by 2007. Today, Indira employs 250 people and Vijay expects FY13 revenues to hit Rs 36 crore, up 50% from the previous year&rsquo;s Rs 24 crore. &ldquo;Growing the business has not been easy. For the past 10 years, I used to pick up the phone on the first ring even if I was fast asleep. Now things have stabilised and we should hit scale,&rdquo; he explains, referring to a Rs 200-crore target he&rsquo;s set for the business over the next four-five years.</p>\n<p class="p3">Most of this will come from new products such as Splitz&rsquo;s tomato paste. A 60 gram packet is equivalent to half a kg of tomatoes and priced at Rs 12, so it should be a value proposition for the consumer. Contends Vijay: &ldquo;No one has ever tried to sell tomato paste in India. At most there have been purees that are much more diluted and priced very high.&rdquo; Tomato paste and puree are both made by boiling tomatoes and straining them. But the paste is cooked for much longer. As a result, it is three times as concentrated as puree and tastes much richer.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Building an appetite</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Vijay&rsquo;s excitement is a bit measured when it comes to the private label business, though. &ldquo;It has been growing at 5-10% and we don&rsquo;t expect the FDI deregulation to do any wonders in the short term,&rdquo; he says, adding that the market for private labels will grow as retailers gain scale, but sales will go up significantly only after three or four years. He points out most retailers in India still do not have well-formed private label strategies. &ldquo;They know they can make more money on selling private labels than on [manufacturer] brands so they want to do it. But they are not very sure of what branding and positioning they want to give to such store-owned brands,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">He recalls how executives from one retailer insisted they wanted only the best quality premium pickles under their private label brand, but balked when told about the costs involved. They then asked Indira to procure medium-quality ingredients that would be less expensive. Another problem is that retailers sometimes discontinue their private label brands for one reason or the other. &ldquo;We have to be careful about planning our inventories. For instance, we may have printed labels in advance, and then suddenly find ourselves saddled with them,&rdquo; says Vijay.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">One reason for such inconsistent strategies, Vijay points out, is the constant churn in the top management of modern retailers as well as managers dealing with third-party manufacturers like Indira. &ldquo;We have to start the entire process again, as a new person often comes in with new ideas of how he wants to do business,&rdquo; he says. A major grouse of private label manufacturers is the thin margins that retailers offer. &ldquo;They insist on the lowest margins, even lower than FMCG companies we sell to.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Technopak&rsquo;s vice president for retail and consumer products, Ankur Bisen, explains that this is because unlike in the West, retail is just an 8-10 year old concept in India. After furious expansion and new store openings in the initial years, retailers now have a number of problems on their plate &mdash; how to make operations profitable, which formats work and which stores they need to shut down. &ldquo;The private label part comes after that,&rdquo; says Bisen, adding that retailers will eventually get their act together. &ldquo;This is the phase of transition in India. And most retailers and private labels have realised that they are going through a necessary learning curve, and this cycle cannot be cut short,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Vijay, however, is bullish on private labels for the expertise and processes they bring. When Future Group began sourcing from Indira a couple of years ago, it insisted on clear guidelines on cleanliness, quality and deadlines being followed. &ldquo;Till then, we had been somewhat informally organised. We were forced to put in processes and pay greater attention to detail,&rdquo; says Vijay. For instance, for the requirement that people wash hands before touching food, Indira installed foot-operated soap dispensers and automatic water dispensers, and educated its workers. As a result, Indira&rsquo;s plants are now even certified for export of food items to the US. &ldquo;We are the only people who are allowed to export tamarind pulp calling it tamarind pulp out of India,&rdquo; he beams.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The main thrust in Indira&rsquo;s future growth will be on products under the Splitz brand &mdash; tomato paste, tamarind pulp, tomato sauce, jams and pickles, and ready-to-eat <em>ragi</em> products. These are already available in markets near Bengaluru and have been well received, says Vijay. Now he wants to take his business to other parts of India. For this, he&rsquo;s busy arranging capital and looking for an investor through a stake sale. This money, he says, will be used to grow pan-India distribution and beef up the brand. &ldquo;Our businesses have now stabilised and have the necessary scale to get into the next level. Now we want to build on the hard work we have done,&rdquo; he sums up.</p>', 'Indira Foods is on a strong footing to meet the next wave of private label growth', '29', '', 0, '', 'a-taste-of-things-to-come-325', 319, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Made to order', 'Prateek Apparel''s', '', '', '', 'Indira Foods', 0, NULL, '2015-01-30 11:21:32', '2015-01-30 11:34:17', '2013-05-11', 0),
(326, 20, '', 'Bringing back the sparkle', '<p class="p1">Do you know who makes Odonil?&rdquo; asks Sunil Jain as he holds up a pack of the eponymous air freshener brand owned by Dabur. The question is rhetorical, of course. Jain&rsquo;s Delhi-based company, Trisis Corp, has been contract manufacturing cleaning products for Dabur and many other leading FMCG brands for well over 30 years now. With Rs 55 crore in annual revenues for FY13, it&rsquo;s also a leading manufacturer for private label brands of modern retail chains in India. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">House brands such as Mopz floor cleaner, Expelz toilet cleaner, Scrubz dish washer, and Shinez glass cleaner sold at Reliance Fresh stores are all manufactured in Jain&rsquo;s factories. So are private labels for other retail chains &mdash; the 110% range from Aditya Birla Retail&rsquo;s More, Clean-mate and White Magic from Big Bazaar, the Arrow range from Metro, and similar products from Bharti-Walmart&rsquo;s Easyday stores. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Trisis Corp- Element</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Trisis, a holding company for Jain&rsquo;s many units, started out in 1976 as Chemisynth, making industrial wetting agents, institutional and home cleaners and laundry detergents. After completing his MBA from Punjab University, Jain started a small factory in Gurgaon with Rs 25,000 from his father, a Rs 2 lakh loan from the Haryana Finance Corporation, and some borrowings from family members. From two units in Gurgaon to three sprawling plants in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh, Jain kept adding to his roster of big name buyers. &ldquo;We started with Mafatlal in the 1980s, added Reckitt &amp; Colman and Modicare in the 1990s, and IFB, Dabur, DuPont and the who&rsquo;s who of Indian retail on board later,&rdquo; he recounts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The three factories in Baddi, in fact, came up alongside the modern retail boom in India. &ldquo;We are considered star suppliers,&rdquo; boasts Jain. This means his products and process capabilities needn&rsquo;t undergo a rigorous screening each time he pitches for new business. &ldquo;Their expertise and association with other big established retailers helped us choose them,&rdquo; agrees Roy Thomas, head, buying and merchandising (private labels), at Metro Cash &amp; Carry India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Slippery ground</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">India&rsquo;s organised retail evolution has meant a twin-pronged opportunity for small suppliers such as Trisis. There&rsquo;s business from private labels, and also from local and regional brands that have been finding their way onto the shelves of modern retail stores. &ldquo;The proportion of SME-manufactured products is 40-50% in Big Bazaar and around 30% in Reliance Retail stores,&rdquo; says Anil Bhardwaj, secretary general, Federation of Indian Micro and Small and Medium Enterprises (FIMSME).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">This opportunity came with its challenges in the initial years, says Jain. &ldquo;Orders were placed but not picked up as their sales forecasts would go terribly wrong.&rdquo; It was a double whammy for suppliers like Jain who had, in turn, placed advance orders for ingredients and packaging material. &ldquo;Retailers dragged their feet when it came to compensating for such situations,&rdquo; says Jain, adding that while the uncertainty continues, things have improved significantly now.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">So much so that he takes pride in being flexible in meeting fluctuations in demand from his customers. &ldquo;We accommodate varying demands easily. When we started making Vanish [a stain remover from Reckitt Benckiser], we were told to make 30 tonnes per month. Next month the company asked us to deliver 130 tonnes per month. And we made that,&rdquo; says Jain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">All this gets Trisis a thumbs up from one of its marquee clients &mdash; Bharti-Walmart&rsquo;s EasyDay chain. &ldquo;Chemisynth is a capable and professional company, and has significantly partnered with us in our mission to help our customers save money, by supplying good quality and competitively priced products on time. Our business with them has grown significantly over the years,&rdquo; says a spokesperson from Bharti-Walmart.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>New avenues</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">While he won&rsquo;t disclose margins in the private label supply business, Jain insists these are already quite thin thanks to cut-throat competition, and hard bargaining by bigger retail clients. Now, margins are under further pressure. Jain says the wage bill for his 300-odd employees runs to Rs 20 lakh every month and recently, due to a pre-election revision in minimum wages by the Himachal Pradesh government, it&rsquo;s shot up by 25%. &ldquo;We are still negotiating with some of our customers for a higher rate.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">For SME suppliers like Trisis, the fear of being bulldozed by retail giants with deep pockets is a real one. Supply contracts can be one-sided and riddled with legal jargon. Jain recalls how he opted out of a potential supply contract with a leading French retail chain that entered India recently. &ldquo;It was highly one-sided, and we couldn&rsquo;t agree,&rdquo; he explains. While his daughter, a corporate lawyer by profession, helps him de-jargonise the lengthy contracts, other small suppliers have little recourse. &ldquo;There is no dedicated mechanism to vet draft contract agreements anywhere for MSMEs. It will be critical in the wake of the superstore era,&rdquo; says VK Aggarwal, president, FIMSME.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There have been benefits from working with modern retailers too. Jain says he&rsquo;s been invited to spend time and work closely with the product development teams at Aditya Birla Retail and Reliance Retail. &ldquo;We tried the formulation suggested by their R&amp;D teams and have improved our products,&rdquo; he says. In return, Jain&rsquo;s team brings its experience to the table. &ldquo;We provide technical services to our clients, helping them with making formulations. We also suggest modifications, if some product is not doing well.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Trisis has a few of its own brands out as well, in the B2B market. Among them is Kemidet B-300, an industrial detergent it has been selling for the past 15 years to corporates and institutional customers &mdash; tea gardens, government departments, engineering, shipping, and railway. Another is Dishmatic, a dish washing detergent that had LG and IFB as former customers, and is now supplied to dish washer manufacturers such as Kaff Appliances and Spain&rsquo;s CATA. Both brands do sales of about Rs 2-3 lakh per month.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Now Jain is gearing up to take his products to the consumer market. Among them will be toilet cleaners, floor cleaners and dish washing liquid. These will be launched in eastern states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Haryana and Punjab in the north, to begin with, and on e-commerce sites. Would he like to go pan India, if big box retailers roll out in big way in future? &ldquo;Well, that will be adventurous. Also, volumes have to justify such scaling up,&rdquo; replies Jain, who is a bit apprehensive but hopeful that the effects of FDI in retail will work out well for small businesses like his. &ldquo;We are already supplying to Walmart. So I hope that they [and others] will stick with us when the time comes,&rdquo; he adds. <span class="s1"><br /></span></p>', 'Trisis Corp''s cleaning products'' business is a perfect springboard for its own upcoming brands ', '9', '', 0, '', 'bringing-back-the-sparkle-326', 320, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Bringing back the sparkle ', 'Trisis Corp''s cleaning products'' business is a perfect springboard for its own upcoming brands ', '', '', '', 'Trisis Corp,Dabur,Reckitt & Colman', 0, NULL, '2015-01-30 11:35:32', '2015-01-30 11:55:06', '2013-05-11', 0),

(328, 24, '', 'Right on course', '<p class="p1">On quiet Sunday afternoons, away from the stress of work, Sukumar Rajah, managing director and CIO, Asian equity, of Franklin Templeton, may be found playing a relaxing round or two of golf. It&rsquo;s been a decade-long passion, discovered after a life-long enjoyment of different sports. It&rsquo;s easy to assume that golf offers a tranquil escape from the adrenalin-charged world of investing &mdash; surely, no two things could be more disparate. Interestingly, Rajah finds not only similarities but helpful insights. &ldquo;Investment is, strictly speaking, not only a function of the left brain,&rdquo; he says, referring to the theory that the two halfs of the brain control different ways of thinking &mdash; the left is considered logical and analytical, while the right is creative. &ldquo;Many of us tend to think investment is about logic alone but it&rsquo;s more than that. A fair degree of thinking at multiple levels is required and that&rsquo;s true also of golf.&rdquo; Golf, says Rajah, takes a combination of skills and it&rsquo;s a tricky business. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a game of strategy as well as creative thinking, which makes it rather like investing.&rdquo; He started playing golf 10 years ago but rues that he doesn&rsquo;t get enough time for the game. Still, he manages to get away for golf-related events organised by his company.</p>\n<p class="p3">So, is sport the perfect escape from the result-driven world of investment? Rajah disagrees that the function of investment can be defined by deadlines or targets. &ldquo;It is a quality-driven function, not a quantity-driven one,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;A good investment manager may take a while to arrive at his decision but if he gets it right, that one good decision is worth 50 other calls that may have been taken by others.&rdquo; He offers Warren Buffett as a prime example: the investment guru may invest in just one company through a whole year but it is likely to be a decision that surpasses most others. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think targets and pressures at work should come in the way of rest and sleep. An investment manager is not going to take better decisions if he forgoes sleep and, instead, spends all that time on thinking about companies.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Another point Rajah makes is that golf, unlike most other games, pits you against yourself. &ldquo;Unlike tennis or cricket, getting better at golf requires us to work around our handicaps &mdash; it&rsquo;s not about defeating an opponent, which is true of all other sports,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It could be any kind of sport,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;I have had an interest in different games and I think they all provide the right mix of challenge and enjoyment, along with the opportunity to meet like-minded people.&rdquo; The health benefits, it turns out, are just a bonus &mdash; in the case of golf, all that walking around and fresh air and sunlight.</p>\n<p class="p3">Golf, for Rajah, is a journey in self-improvement. It not only makes golf endlessly interesting, there is much to gain from it at a less conscious level. Reading books on investment will help, but&nbsp; only to a certain extent, he feels. It [what is said in books] has happened to someone else, it&rsquo;s someone else&rsquo;s point of view, and it is theoretical to us. Sports, on the other hand, require us to think things through in real time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">What Rajah likes most about golf is the chance to keep learning something new. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s always true, no matter how many times we play,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There will be a particular stroke, an angle or a distance that you learn to handle, or you develop the ability to handle different weather conditions such as wind, humidity and rain. There is beauty and perfection in movement. Moreover, we win and lose in games, as we do in life.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>', 'Sukumar Rajah of Franklin Templeton finds parallels in the world of investing and golf', '34', '', 0, '', 'right-on-course-328', 322, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Right on course', 'Sukumar Rajah of Franklin Templeton finds parallels in the world of investing and golf', '', '', '', 'Sukumar Rajah,Franklin Templeton,Golf', 0, NULL, '2015-01-30 11:57:54', '2015-01-30 12:01:30', '2013-05-11', 0),
(329, 24, '', 'Perfetti''s teething problems', '<p class="p1">The first products to be sold were some gums that had a large success in the home country. But then the first market problems started. The strategy used by the company was centered on the standardisation of products and communication and specifically the extension of the products and communication mix used with success in the home country. The formats initially produced and marketed were similar to those utilised in Italy, namely stick pack of five pieces each &mdash; both for Big Babol, a bubble gum, and Center Fresh, a liquid-filled chewing gun. Such packs were sold in display boxes of 24 pieces at a (consumer) price of Rs 7 each (hence Rs 168 for display boxes). The price was way above the market prices from two different perspectives: local gums were sold at Rs 0.5 each &mdash; Re 1 for the &ldquo;premium&rdquo; ones &mdash; and they were mainly sold in mono pieces. Formats like those initially introduced by Perfetti were unaffordable both for the retailers and for consumers. The former were used to buy displays of 100/150 pieces of much cheaper products, for a total expense of Rs 75 to 150 (at consumer price). Perfetti used to sell the displays for Rs 168 (at consumer price), hence with an out-of-pocket for retailers up to over two times that of the local competitors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Only restricted elites among Indian consumers could afford spending Rs 7 for a pack of gums, particularly since the core target here was children and not young adults, like in Italy. The communication used was a standardised one: Italian commercials were dubbed in English and aired. Even the communication mix did not really work well, since there was a kind of disconnect between the Italian commercials and the average Indian public. If the reason to enter the Indian market was mainly the large number of potential consumers, given the country&rsquo;s huge population, the initial marketing mix was possibly not coherent with such objective.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There was scope for learning also in the formulations of the products. After a few weeks since the liquid-filled gums were in the market, the first complaints surfaced about the fact that the products had started leaking: the syrup inside was coming out of the gum making the product look messy and the wrapper sticky. Here the problem was caused by much hotter and humid climatic conditions compared to the European ones, whereas the products&rsquo; recipe of the home country had not been changed much.

By looking at 3,654 companies that went public from 1980 to 2010 in the US, they found out that a firm with an upcoming initial public offering (IPO) hires twice more employees around its IPO than during its life as a private firm. The number of employees increases at an average annual rate of 39% during the two-year period around the IPO. By having access to debt and equity markets, the firm has much more bargaining power in terms of procuring funds directly from the markets than from banks at higher rates. The companies may then use these funds to invest in organic growth or human capital, which, in turn, increases the probability of better performance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>Title:</strong>&nbsp;IPOs and Employment</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>Source:</strong> Social Science Research Network</p>\n<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Trend in the making</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1">With increasing competition in every field, marketing techniques are continuously evolving.

With the mainstream popularity of lit fests, Chetan Bhagat bestsellers morphing into Bollywood blockbusters, Shobhaa De&rsquo;s frequent outings on television, Jeffrey Archer&rsquo;s wooing of the world&rsquo;s &ldquo;largest English-speaking&rdquo; population, the easy recognisability of Amish Tripathi and his envy-dripping writing advance of #5 crore as a cult celebrity, it could hardly be otherwise. Read them or not, you&rsquo;ve got to love them as the latest accessory, an intellectual luxury, so to say &mdash; but hey, where do you buy books?</p>\n<p class="p3">Malls do have bookstores, but they&rsquo;re bustling places where a &ldquo;70% discount&rdquo; is the draw rather than the quality of selection of books. No luxury mall has a book shop; buying on Flipkart is enticing but hardly what book lovers enjoy &mdash; physically touching books, pulling them out of shelves, turning them over to read; while Kindle is, well &mdash; sorry guys &mdash; so sterile.</p>\n<p class="p3">The neighbourhood bookshop has all but disappeared. Fortunately, the revival of reading has received a shot in the arm. While a few of the old stores had struggled to stay on, book buying as an experience on par with lifestyle products received a boost only when CMYK debuted in Mehar Chand Market in the capital, setting a benchmark for other newbie stores (no one else quite measured up, till now, that is). That standard has just been breached by the old-new Oxford Bookstore Connaught Place in New Delhi, putting the Landmarks and Crossroads in the shade. Priti Paul&rsquo;s eponymous store, which had mysteriously shut down in the capital, has emerged, as the marketing slogan goes, &ldquo;bigger, better and improved&rdquo;. While Connaught Place itself appears to be haemorrhaging, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before it reclaims its space as the city&rsquo;s premier shopping and leisure district.</p>\n<p class="p3">As though in preparation for that, the bookstore announced its arrival in the colonnaded arcades with a series of events &mdash; conversations and seminars and parties on books, translations, the Commonwealth book prize &mdash; making reading a talking point once again in a society jaded with too many fashion, art and brand launches. The new space offers what bookstores increasingly lack &mdash; browsing space. In a shop where you&rsquo;re encouraged to hang around, &ldquo;feel&rdquo; the books, lift titles enticingly displayed on shelves as provocatively as an Hermes &ldquo;it&rdquo; bag, chat up with writers &mdash; was that really Mohsin Hamid? and Chetan Bhagat? &mdash; attend book readings, releases and signings, it&rsquo;s making a destination not just for those who&rsquo;re book lovers, but for those only too happy to sign up for the experience because it shows up shopping at Gucci or Canali as a thoughtless activity compared with the intellectual feast a bookstore offers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The selection of books helps too, even if somewhat condescendingly with &ldquo;translations&rdquo; of Nobel and Booker long- and short-listed writers conveniently grouped together &mdash; after all, you&rsquo;d want to be pointed to the carts and shelves the papers are writing about, innit? As for those drawn to the popularity of books for their covers, there are shelves of art and illustrated books, lush productions that may cost an arm and a leg &mdash; but with such recent launches as artist Himmat Shah&rsquo;s tome on terracotta that comes in a limited edition with a signed piece as the cover, each Rs 40,000 book is a collectible.

(333, 12, '', 'Online traffic wardens', '<p class="p1">Chetan Kulkarni, Gourav Chindlur and Vikram Nayak were colleagues at the Bengaluru office of Austin, Texas-based software firm Trilogy, where daily discussions at lunch would revolve around Bollywood and cricket, with some tech ideas thrown in. Kulkarni, who had completed his engineering in computer science from NIT Surathkal and MBA from IIM Lucknow, had joined Trilogy in 2004. Nayak, with a masters degree from IIT, also joined around the same time. Chindlur, an engineer and MBA from IIM Kozhikode, had just joined the firm in 2007.</p>\n<p class="p3">As they were exposed to various aspects of internet advertising and building email marketing platforms and behavioural targeting products, the trio, then in their early 30s, sensed that digital media would grow into a huge business in the coming years. By July 2008, they had all quit their jobs at Trilogy, and by December launched their company, Vizury, which, according to the company, means &ldquo;doing good&rdquo;&nbsp; in Swahili. &ldquo;We knew there can be a lot of opportunities, at the intersection of data, technology and marketing, and that is the area we chose,&rdquo; says Kulkarni, CEO, Vizury.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We knew there can be a lot of opportunities and the intersection of data, technology and marketing" - Chetan Kulkarni, cheif executive officer, Vizury</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The idea was to solve a very basic problem that advertisers faced in driving online sales &mdash; many buyers simply drop off at the checkout stage. &ldquo;We wanted to help advertisers get a sense of their digital data and use it to power their own marketing conversations across digital channels with the end goal of having one-to-one conversations with the customer,&rdquo; points out Chindlur, chief operating officer, Vizury. Simply put, the product, visitor relationship management, helps companies find out who visits their website, what products or services they check or view, and at what point they dropped off without making a purchase. It also helps advertisers analyse the tons of digital data that already resides within their systems, and based on the insights culled out, the platform delivers relevant ads on a real time basis.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Vizury - Element</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">For instance, if a customer checks the fares for an air ticket from Chennai to San Francisco on travel portal makemytrip, and drops off without booking the ticket, Vizury assigns a cookie or an alphanumeric code to the user. It then alerts all its media partners such as Google, Yahoo, MSN and Facebook to inform the Vizury server the next time the user comes online. When the user gets online next, the ad servers at Google or MSN inform Vizury&rsquo;s server that the user with that particular code is online and the company&rsquo;s ad server then puts together an ad or a latest offer for the Chennai-San Francisco route from makemytrip. All this happens in real time, in about 12 milliseconds, as the user is browsing the web. &ldquo;This level of personalisation allows advertisers the flexibility to give customised offers or recommendations to their potential customers by aligning their campaigns to their individual needs,&rdquo; explains Nayak, chief technology officer, Vizury. If that smacks a bit too much of Big Brother watching, Nayak is quick to reassure. As far as privacy concerns go, the company uses anonymous cookies that don&rsquo;t have personally assignable data, and users always have the choice of opting out of the ad.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We help advertisers get a sense of their digital data and use it to power their own marketing conversations" - Gourav Chindlur, chief operating officer, Vizury</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Unlike some media companies, Vizury does not buy inventory on ad networks beforehand. It uses real time bidding (RTB). Here, the algorithm that it has built will assign a probability to the buyer going ahead with the transaction, based on how many times he viewed the ad or checked out fares for the sector or going by his previous transactions. If the probability of the transaction is high, then it bids higher for the ad space but if the probability is low, then it has the option of not bidding for the space or bidding lower.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Right clicks</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Vizury offers clients a performance-based platform, which means it earns a commission on every sale it makes. In most cases, it gets paid only when a user transacts on its customers&rsquo; websites. &ldquo;We are not there to take away their marketing budget. We want to create a long-term customer engagement and sales channel,&rdquo; says Kulkarni. Right now, the focus is on websites and banner advertisements. For every 100 viewers who see an online advertisement, only one goes on to click on it and even fewer go on to complete a transaction. The challenge with banner advertising has been that of relevance. But now, display advertising is more data driven. By placing the right ads at the right place at the right time, the worth of those impressions can definitely go up.&nbsp; Vizury&rsquo;s re-targeting software helps advertisers convert more of their prospects, increasing their online revenues. &ldquo;We contribute about 3-8% of revenues on their websites,&rdquo; says Kulkarni. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While it started with the Indian market, the company soon discovered greater demand overseas for its product. Vizury now gets 75% of its revenues from international markets and has offices in Dubai, Beijing, Sydney, Sao Paulo and Tokyo. Kulkarni explains the company has followed a strategic decision to be present only in markets where it can be the leader. As a result, in some countries such as the Netherlands, Spain and Italy, where it could not scale up operations to desired levels as some partnerships didn&rsquo;t work out, it exited within six months.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Apart from the usual challenges of adapting to the new environment of a country it enters and hiring local talent in large numbers, the company ensures that its content is tweaked in line with the local culture so that it puts out more relevant ads online.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Surprisingly, the company is yet to make a foray into the US, which is considered the world&rsquo;s largest digital marketing destination globally, with an estimated size of $8-10 billion. &ldquo;We wanted to enter the US when we started but we did not have the money. We then felt it was better to address markets where we could be market leaders rather than be the fourth or fifth company in the US,&rdquo; explains Kulkarni. Now, with a stronger brand, a larger international presence and a product that has been tried and tested, the company is planning its US foray soon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Vizury&rsquo;s business model pits it in direct competition with Google and others such as myThings in the UK, Criteo in France and Sociomatic in Germany. It competes with these firms in Brazil and China, as well. &ldquo;Google is an ecosystem and you have to live in it and prosper in it,&rdquo; says Kulkarni, who believes there are gaps in the internet ecosystem that need to be plugged. &ldquo;Our bet is that Vizury can build a niche out here,&rdquo; he says. From its first domestic client, Cleartrip, it has gone on to add over 500 clients to its portfolio, including airline majors Jet Airways, Eithad, Virgin Atlantic, travel sites such as Expedia, Makemytrip and leading e-commerce companies like Jabong , Snapdeal and Flipkart. Its overseas customers include travel site Ctrip in China, Netshoes in Brazil that sells sporting goods, and Souq, an e-commerce site in the UAE.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Growing up pangs</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">It was a struggle when the company started out, though, as 2008 was certainly not the best time to start a business. And, with the global financial crisis unfolding at the time, raising money from venture capitalists was tough. &ldquo;There were times when we started to question whether we were in the market at the right time or if the product was relevant, but we never wanted to give up on the idea,&rdquo; says Chindlur.&nbsp; However, they managed to raise funding of $150,000 from family and friends, in 2009. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The next year, Vizury raised $2 million from Ojas Ventures and Inventus Capital. &ldquo;We did take some time to wrap our heads around their business model. Having said that, we are very impressed with how Vizury has managed to scale up its business in the last couple of years,&rdquo; says Parag Dhol, managing director, Inventus Capital. A third round of funding worth $9 million came in October 2012, and was led by Nokia Growth Partners along with the existing investors, Ojas and Inventus.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We are very impressed with how Vizury has managed to scale up its business in the last few years" - Parag Dhol, managing director, Inventus Capital</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The company is now looking to extend its proposition to mobile devices. &ldquo;We are going wherever data is generated,&rdquo; says Nayak. &ldquo;We definitely have plans to do something around mobile in the coming months.&rdquo; Most of Vizury&rsquo;s corporate clients have customers who are increasingly accessing their website or making transactions on their mobile phones and tablets. In the case of travel portal Expedia, which is a client, as much as 30% of traffic is from mobile devices and 12% of transactions take place through the mobile phone.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We are going wherever data is generated. We definitely have plans for mobile" - Vikram Nayak, chief technology officer, Vizury</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Building a global company out of India has never been easy but a few such as inMobi, Druva, Mu Sigma, Zoho and Vizury have managed to do that, and the rewards are much higher. Vizury has grown over 200 times in revenues since it started, albeit on a lower base. With annual revenues of around $20 million (75% from overseas operations), and a team of 150, its founders hope to maintain the revenue growth momentum during the next couple of years as well. &ldquo;We have just seeded many of the international markets, and this year we expect a lot of growth to come from these markets,&rdquo; says Kulkarni. Vizury&rsquo;s promoters estimate the market opportunity to reach $2-3 billion in Japan and China by 2015, and $1-2 billion in Australia and Brazil around the same time. With more and more companies increasing their digital advertising spends to reach their customers in real time, things appear to be on target for Vizury.&nbsp;</p>', 'Vizury''s re-targeting solutions work smartly to bring back online customers who drop off without purchasing ', '6', '', 0, '', 'online-traffic-wardens-333', 327, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Online traffic wardens', 'Vizury''s re-targeting solutions work smartly to bring back online customers who drop off without purchasing ', '', '', '', 'Vizury,Online advertisers,Real time bidding,Re-targeting software', 0, NULL, '2015-01-30 12:32:21', '2015-01-30 12:53:09', '2013-06-22', 0),
(334, 15, '', 'Older and wiser', '<p class="p1">There are four different types of &lsquo;supermarkets&rsquo; &mdash; that rather antiquated yet comforting term in the era of specialised retail formats &mdash; within walking distance in the seaside and upmarket neighbourhood of Besant Nagar in southern Chennai. There&rsquo;s a mom-and-pop store that recently, and reluctantly, relaunched with cramped, air-conditioned aisles (another downed shutters over a year ago). There&rsquo;s a government-run co-operative where the prices are as unbeatable as the indifferent service. There&rsquo;s big boy Spencer&rsquo;s with its perpetual discount boards. And then, there&rsquo;s Nilgiri&rsquo;s, which is none of the above. Still, should there be a local popularity poll, it looks like Nilgiri&rsquo;s would win by miles. Regulars ignore the parking troubles, they know the house brand of breads will run out by end of day and almost certainly early on weekend evenings, home-delivery is underplayed, the pricing is unapologetically premium and there are never any discounts on the MRP, ever.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Surviving for more than a century in the pernickety business of retail makes for a doughty brand, and at this and 129 other branches across 15 cities in the South, mainly in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, it&rsquo;s easy to see why the Rs 650-crore Nilgiri&rsquo;s has been thriving since 1905. It started as Nilgiri&rsquo;s Dairy Farm, a butter business that Muthuswamy Mudaliar, a mail runner for the British Government, bought from an Englishman in Vannarpet, Ooty. In 1936, Mudaliar launched his first store in Bangalore on Brigade Road. It was his son Chenniappan&rsquo;s visit to Europe and the US that led to the unique Nilgiri&rsquo;s supermarket format in 1945 that sold its own dairy and bakery products in addition to other brands.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Nilgiri''s - Element</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">It was customer service that kept the brand alive till 2006, when UK-based PE fund Actis bought a controlling stake of 66% for an undisclosed sum, revamping its supply chain and pushing for profitable store expansion. &ldquo;Nilgiri&rsquo;s is probably the most profitable food and grocery retailer in India now. Unlike many other retailers in India, we have been consistently profitable for quite a while now,&rdquo; says Shomik Mukherjee, partner,&nbsp; consumer sector at Actis.</p>\n<p class="p3">Nilgiri&rsquo;s operates through the franchise route with 80%, or 103 outlets run by franchisees. It averages sales of Rs 2,000 per sq ft per store monthly, that&rsquo;s around Rs 20 lakh for a 1,000 sq ft store and almost twice that of its nearest competitor by Nilgiri&rsquo;s CEO Murali Krishnan&rsquo;s estimates. In fact, its three recently opened stores at Navalur, Thoraipakkam and Padur on Chennai&rsquo;s IT corridor, Old Mahabalipuram Road &mdash; a hot destination for home developers in the last five-eight years that still lacks the sort of upscale neighbourhoods its cosmopolitan residents expect &mdash; have already seen sales of Rs 3,500 per sq ft. Here, the demographic changes from the conservative city shopper to a yuppie crowd that &ldquo;freaks out on frozen and exotic foods, which is why we have more and more vertical freezers coming up in all our stores,&rdquo; says Murali Krishnan, who&rsquo;s been with the chain since 2009.</p>\n<p class="p3">Product innovation and a focus on health have kept the brand relevant to customers. Its recently launched cold-pressed gingelly (sesame) oil is a first in the market and outside its core competency of bakery and dairy products. &ldquo;Similarly, we have launched sugar-free flaxseed, <em>jamun</em> and <em>dalia</em> cookies, fruit yoghurts with exotic berries, probiotic curd, flavoured <em>lassis</em> and a carry-to-work-and-add-milk porridge,&rdquo; Krishnan adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Old strengths, new strengths</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Nilgiri&rsquo;s, with its farmer-base of 5,000 milk suppliers, some of them in relationships that are now over three decades old, has its freshness quotient nailed to the last wedge&nbsp;of its famous butter. The company&rsquo;s three verticals are its franchisee business, general trade bakery that supplies baked goods to mom-and-pop stores, and general trade dairy. Staples is the fastest growing segment in the franchisee outlets while dairy is the biggest volume and value segment for&nbsp;the company.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The bakery division operates out of a large manufacturing facility in Bengaluru, where orders pour in from all stores by 11 am. These are baked and despatched by 7 pm for sale following morning in Hyderabad, Chennai, Bengaluru and Thiruvananthapuram. &ldquo;We truly believe freshness is our mainstay,&rdquo; says Krishnan. It&rsquo;s the same with packaged foods: a pack of chips at a Nilgiri&rsquo;s store is not likely to be more than a month old, regardless of its shelf life as the chain eschews deep discounts on bulk supplies for smaller quantities to enable fresh turnover in food products. Nevertheless, the legendary bakery division needs a revamp, Krishnan admits, as people have now started going to upscale standalone bakeries with fresh cream offerings instead of the traditional butter cream that Nilgiri&rsquo;s still uses.</p>\n<p class="p3">Private labels is another area where it goes against the grain in the trade. Modern retailers typically pitch their own brands as more affordable alternatives to manufacturer brands. At Nilgiri&rsquo;s, though, its <em>dals</em>, grains, dry fruits, flours and spices are sold at a premium of around 20% over the nearest competitors. &ldquo;Food is the differentiator in supermarkets and it is our strength,&rdquo; says Krishnan. &ldquo;Our private label in foods is our footfall driver &mdash; 68% of our sales comes from food. And since we are private label players in only food, the actual share of our home brand in total sales is nearly 30%.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Long tail logic</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The other aspect defining Nilgiri&rsquo;s is its long tail. Most &lsquo;supermarkets&rsquo; have 1,000-2,000 sq ft of space to offer, typically averaging between two sizes, and all their shelves are fully stocked. What, then, is the differentiator for Nilgiri&rsquo;s? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that they [the competitors] keep more of the same things and we keep a much larger range,&rdquo; explains Krishnan, adding that Nilgiri&rsquo;s averages net margins of 14-15% across segments, at the company level. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t stock up for higher margins because some supplier is offering them to us. We offer a wider, more efficient inventory from the buyer&rsquo;s perspective.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There are two ways in which a supermarket can use its space: stock more of the same or stock less of a larger variety. Nilgiri&rsquo;s opts for the latter and its consumers come looking for that range of &lsquo;everything you want&rsquo;, not discounts. &ldquo;The franchisee plays a crucial role in managing this vast inventory and the success of a store depends on the degree of his involvement,&rdquo; says Krishnan. Modern retailers typically operate out of large, centralised warehouses and ship out preset quantities from a catalogue of about 2,000-2,500 SKUs (stock keeping units) sourced from suppliers offering the deepest discounts. This leaves franchisees with limited flexibility in stocking at the store level. It&rsquo;s also the reason why in most modern retail stores, 20% of SKUs, typically in staples like <em>atta</em>, sugar, rice and washing powder, fetch 80% of revenues with wafer-thin margins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Nilgiri&rsquo;s turns that system on its head by doing away with a centralised warehouse and facilitating direct deliveries from a much larger database of suppliers, leaving the what, when and how much to the franchisees. It&rsquo;s far more problematic to manage such a long tail in the supply chain but the customer is delighted to find powdered flax seed, a Rs 5-packet of ajinomoto, or fresh yeast, palm jaggery and hill garlic, all under one roof. &ldquo;Nobody can match our inventory,&rdquo; claims Krishnan. &ldquo;Even if a customer wants cherry tomatoes, he may not have it the same day but he will have it on the next. It&rsquo;s a complex business and the customer has an opinion. They will simply ask: &lsquo;but why can&rsquo;t you keep this?&rsquo; Naturally, they cannot be expected to realise what goes into the logistics of keeping that one thing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Generally, &lsquo;supermarkets&rsquo; stock 1,500-2,000 SKUs in a 1,000 sq ft store, which means one or two SKUs for every sq ft of retail space. Nilgiri&rsquo;s does four-five SKUs per sq ft in its stores, which translates into four times more product range on offer. This is done keeping in mind customer preferences in every store catchment &mdash; <em>aapam</em> in Kerala, ragi <em>dosa</em> in Karnataka, frozen foods for Christian communities &mdash; although 80-85% of the inventory is common across a region.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Family affair</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">A retail brand this old comes with a strong pull, and the opening of a new store usually sees throngs of customers there just to check things out with nostalgic memories of childhood shopping experiences. &ldquo;Nowhere is the consumer connect as strong as it is in food retail,&rdquo; says Krishnan. This connect and local knowledge are proving useful in new destinations such as Kerala, considered a tough market with thin margins. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t easy, but in seven months, after some initial struggles, we are the number one store in Thiruvananthapuram, and the knowledge of our Malayalee customers in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka has helped us.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">There are 30 new stores planned over the next one year. While Tamil Nadu is well-represented, especially Chennai, there&rsquo;s plenty of room to grow in Karnataka and Kerala. Nilgiri&rsquo;s plans to enter nine new cities this year, and smaller towns like Vellore and Trichy will be the focus now, says Actis&rsquo; Mukherjee. &ldquo;We would like to take it to the next level by moving to towns outside the main metros.&rdquo; Commercial space is a big challenge. Getting a good franchisee is the other as the entire dynamics of store and inventory management leads to massive back-end work and demands deep personal involvement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It costs Rs 45-70 lakh to set up a modern food and grocery outlet, depending on the location. The franchisee is given flexibility and control over inventory, which is delivered by a centralised list of suppliers at margins that are 3-4% <em>higher </em>than what standalone stores would get from the same suppliers. Breakeven happens as early as the third week &mdash; the new stores on Old Mahabalipuram Road did it in 10 days. This model will now be put to test in small towns, but Krishnan is confident that the over 108-year-old brand will pass muster.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We [Nilgiri''s] went through a period of expansion where it took time for us to scale up" - Shomik Mukherjee, partner, consumer sector, Actis</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Much of this confidence stems from the changes that Actis helped bring about after coming in, seven years ago. This included hiving off some real estate, professionalising operations, smoothening a worn-out supply chain, and making course corrections such as disbanding the master-franchisee concept, even as the family consolidated several fractious and small shareholdings. &ldquo;We had a few stores that were doing very well, and a lot of stores that were doing badly,&rdquo; says Krishnan. &ldquo;We had to understand what the consumer wanted &mdash; franchisees are front-end focused whereas we still had to get our back-end processes right. We found that we weren&rsquo;t well-represented in terms of location or range of foods, all of which we fixed with a lot of trial and error. After six months of rigorous focus, we began to improve and reposition our brand, including our tagline &mdash; &lsquo;at the heart of good taste since 1905&rsquo;.&rdquo; This was just what the iconic, yet fading, brand needed in a new retail context. It remains to be seen if, like the mountains it&rsquo;s evidently named after, Nilgiri&rsquo;s can stand tall in the times to come. &nbsp;</p>', 'Nilgiri''s has survived over a 100 years in the highly competitive retail space and plans to grow bigger', '5', '', 0, '', 'older-and-wiser-334', 328, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Older and wiser', 'Nilgiri''s has survived over a 100 years in the highly competitive retail space and plans to grow bigger', '', '', '', 'Nilgiri''s,Supermarket', 0, NULL, '2015-01-30 12:52:47', '2015-01-30 15:19:20', '2013-06-22', 0),
(335, 16, '', 'Selective shopping', '<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s not only individual customers who look to fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies for can&rsquo;t-refuse deals. Even private equity players are turning to the sector as a good investment destination. Whether it&rsquo;s Temasek (through its investment arm Baytree) investing $140 million in Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL), Indivest and Baring investing $97.8 million in Marico, or last fortnight, International Finance Corporation putting in $17 million in Parag Milk Foods, most domestic consumer goods majors have seen significant PE activity since 2012. <em>(See: Betting on a sure thing)</em></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Betting on a sure thing - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Indeed, according to data from Grant Thornton, the value of all PE investments in the sector is up from $221 million in 2010 to $338 million two years later. The reason this is a sector that&rsquo;s traditionally considered recession-proof and will, therefore, be in the money in the future as well. Agrees Ajeet Singh Karan, partner, Baring Private Equity Partners (India), &ldquo;There is an element of predictability here, unlike a sector such as infrastructure,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Getting the valuation right, though, is a challenge. As Karan says, &ldquo;This is not an inexpensive sector.&rdquo; Grant Thornton estimates the Indian FMCG market was worth Rs 3.10 lakh crore in 2012 and will register a CAGR of 10% to reach Rs 4.10 lakh crore by 2015. It is this growth that is attracting PE funds, not to mention the rising stock prices of FMCG companies. But what about the companies? What makes them willing to take on a private investor when they have become so much more cautious when it comes to mergers and acquisitions? <em>(See: Willing to sell but unwilling to buy)</em></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Willing to sell but unwilling to buy - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Acquiring a company at current valuations may not make sense, but it is an ideal time to cash in on high valuations and privately place equity. That provides much needed capital for expansion and given the prospects of the sector, expansion is certainly warranted. PE investors largely take a small stake and leave the running of the company to the promoter. This arrangement&nbsp; suits the promoter, who gets the money and retains control as well. Rasna chairman Piruz Khambatta points out that PE funds could also come in with the objective of selling out to a strategic partner once the company gains scale. A case in point is Paras Pharma, which was sold by Actis to Reckitt Benckiser and later to Marico.</p>\n<p class="p3">Adi Godrej, chairman, Godrej group, maintains that PE funds invest in FMCG companies since they see a huge value creation over the next five years. That&rsquo;s certainly proved the case with GCPL &mdash; the deal with Temasek was struck at Rs 410 a share in end-December 2012; the GCPL stock is currently trading at Rs 865. Incidentally, the Temasek investment was meant to not only reduce the debt on GCPL&rsquo;s books but also fund its purchase of 60% stake in Chilean hair colour and cosmetics company, Cosmetica Nacional. &ldquo;We were looking at equity infusion and Temasek offered us good terms. Hence, we concluded the transaction,&rdquo; Godrej explains the deal.</p>\n<p class="p3">Similarly, Baring&rsquo;s deal with Marico helped the Mumbai-based consumer goods company complete its buyout of Paras Pharma&rsquo;s personal care business for $100 million. Others have used capital infusion to expand business organically. Last September, IDFC Private Equity put in $29 million for an estimated 20% stake in Parag Milk Foods, a large player in the private dairy industry. Now, International Finance Corporation will invest $17 million, which will go into expanding the company&rsquo;s milk processing facilities in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. According to Devendra Shah, chairman, Parag Milk Foods, the plan is to strengthen the company&rsquo;s operations by focusing on plant automation, apart from expanding the procurement and distribution network.</p>\n<p class="p3">The romance of private equity funds with FMCG companies is likely to continue for a while &mdash; most other sectors are over-regulated and the capital markets, too, look lukewarm. &ldquo;I expect there will be PE players who will be eager to invest in the sector if any player wants to raise further equity,&rdquo; says Godrej.

(336, 16, '', 'Towering ambition', '<p class="p1">When other 16-year-old boys were busy chasing girls or playing cricket, Vikas Oberoi would be at the dining table, drawing plans for buildings. In the evening, the same table would become a boardroom, with Oberoi and his father Ranvir Oberoi discussing the family construction business for hours on end. Oberoi Constructions was then a small builder, with just two residential buildings to its name. More than a decade later, when Vikas Oberoi took over as managing director in 1998, he dusted off those drawings, renamed the company Oberoi Realty and set off to transform both, Mumbai&rsquo;s landscape and the company&rsquo;s fortunes. His first project was in Kandivili, a Mumbai suburb. &ldquo;It was exactly the kind of project I had dreamed of building &mdash; there was a swimming pool, gym&hellip; everything that I wanted in a residential development,&rdquo; says Oberoi, now 43 years old.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">He may well have reason to be pleased with himself. The Rs 1,148-crore Oberoi Realty is now the second-most valuable listed real estate developer in India, after DLF. And it&rsquo;s done this through a combination of right timing, right location, and a prudent and conservative approach in a trade characterised by bold, dramatic bets. How did it get there? And more significantly, can it continue to grow using the same tactics?</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Focused approach</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The cornerstone of Oberoi&rsquo;s strategy has been its riveted focus on the premium end of the housing and commercial real estate market, from day one. The Kandivili project, Oberoi Gardens, for instance, had three towers of 27 floors each and all 324 apartments were 3-bedroom ones. &ldquo;We wanted to tell people they can get luxury even in the suburbs,&rdquo; says Oberoi. It isn&rsquo;t just add-ons like tennis courts and air-conditioned lobbies that made the difference, though &mdash; in Mumbai&rsquo;s tough real estate market, Oberoi Realty has managed to build a reputation of delivering apartments on time. &ldquo;Except for a six month delay here and there, all our projects have been delivered on time,&rdquo; claims Oberoi, pointing that outsourcing construction to firms like L&amp;T and Samsung C&amp;T has helped ensure quality and timely delivery in its high-profile projects. &ldquo;Oberoi&rsquo;s quality has met the expectation of buyers, because of which they make slightly higher realisation than their peers,&rdquo; avers Arun Agarwal, an analyst with Religare Securities. Moreover, the company commands a premium of 20-25% in every project it builds. &ldquo;An Oberoi property is the costliest in the area it is in,&rdquo; says Oberoi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Analysts agree that Oberoi is way ahead of builders such as Sunteck Realty, which sells a third of what Oberoi does, despite offering lower rates. While other developers spread their projects across segments, Oberoi Realty has been strictly focused on high-income housing. Its ticket size is also much higher, since it doesn&rsquo;t sell anything less that a 3-BHK, with prices starting at Rs 2.5 crore. While residential projects have been its mainstay, bringing in about 80% of revenues, so far, the company has executed 35 projects &mdash; apartments, malls, hotels and commercial properties &mdash; totalling 6 million sq ft of developed space. It has sold about 7.12 million sq ft (this includes part of its under-construction properties already sold) and leased an area of 1.14 million sq ft. It currently has five projects totalling around 8.5 million sq ft, under construction, with an order book of Rs 1,600 crore. Granted, this is a small fraction of market leader DLF&rsquo;s 62 million sq ft under construction, but it&rsquo;s not bad, considering that Oberoi Realty is a Mumbai-centric player unlike DLF, which has been a pan-India developer.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Advantage Oberoi</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Oberoi Realty&rsquo;s successful run as a first-generation builder began with its first purchase in 2002, of Novartis&rsquo;s 60-acre campus in Goregaon, Mumbai for Rs 107 crore. A delay in possession proved fortuitous. &ldquo;Novartis could give possession of the land only in 2007,&rdquo; explains Oberoi. &ldquo;We started selling properties in Goregaon at Rs 2,800 per sq ft but today the product sells at Rs 25,000 a sq ft, so it is a 10x increase in price.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It also helped that the transaction took place before the Reserve Bank of India tightened lending norms for the real estate sector. The Goregaon tract was bought through internal accruals and bank guarantees. Around half of it has been developed and the rest will be completed in the next three years. The land, effectively Oberoi Realty&rsquo;s calling card in Mumbai&rsquo;s crowded property market, now has Oberoi Garden City (OGC), an integrated development with a mall, a five star hotel, an international school, and commercial and residential projects.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Oberoi followed this up with purchases of large tracts in Andheri East (24.47 acres for Rs 106 crore in 2005), Mulund (23 acres for Rs 221 crore in 2005) and Worli (3.01 acres for Rs 300 crore in 2009) in Mumbai. By 2007, the company&rsquo;s debt had mounted to Rs 200 crore, but it repaid this through sales realisations from its Goregaon and Andheri projects. Now, it&rsquo;s the only listed zero-debt real estate company in India. That&rsquo;s an impressive tag, considering that market leader DLF has amassed a debt burden of Rs 21,731 crore. Vikas Oberoi attributes this to prudence and timely purchase of land. &ldquo;We buy when everyone is selling and sell when everyone is buying,&rdquo; explains Oberoi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Now, Oberoi says he wants to move to a just-in-time inventory model for land acquisition, as is the case in other markets globally. He explains that there&rsquo;s little point in holding on to a land bank, because one cannot be sure that prices will go up. But how well will this play out in a business where developers have built their businesses largely on the back of well-timed land purchase and holdings? &ldquo;In India, a just in time model may not work,&rdquo; says Arvind Nandan, executive director, consulting services, at Cushman &amp; Wakefield (India). &ldquo;It can work in specific situations where land is procured from a government agency, where you can take land and not spend money on preparing it. But, in a majority of cases land prices change so much that if you wait for the land, it may become expensive.&rdquo; Nandan adds that the concept of a land bank has worked in India for a reason. &ldquo;One reason is developers want to secure land at cheap rates in locations that show potential. Developers also want to keep land in hand in the hope that they can trade it off in the future,&rdquo; he says. Oberoi Realty currently has about 20 million sq ft of land under development in Goregaon, Andheri, Worli, Mulund and Pune.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Another factor that worked for Oberoi has been its conservative approach to buying property. While bidding for land, it has shown a restraint that&rsquo;s been missing in its competitors. For example, in August last year, Lodha Developers bought DLF&rsquo;s 17-acre Mumbai Textile Mill plot in Worli for Rs 2,700 crore, nearly four times higher than the price at which DLF bought the parcel back in 2005. Lodha also paid Rs 4,050 crore for 6.17-acres in Wadala in 2010. Will Oberoi Realty ever consider such aggressive bids? Oberoi says even though it may make sense for other builders, his company would rather buy land during a downturn. &ldquo;We will never buy land that doesn&rsquo;t make economical sense.&rdquo; People who know him say he&rsquo;s a tough negotiator who wouldn&rsquo;t settle for a return below 30%&nbsp; even as others settle for anything between 25% and 30% return.</p>\n<p class="p3">The hard-nosed approach has mostly worked. Oberoi Realty earns a margin of 50% for two reasons &mdash; its land buying strategy and zero interest costs. Construction expenses are taken care of through payments from home buyers. &ldquo;It works beautifully for us,&rdquo; says Oberoi. Ideally, in residential projects, the construction cost is linked to buyer payment, but if sales are down, some developers resort to debt to finance construction cost. This could be either debt from banks or proxy debt of the type that one sees builders offering: EMI schemes, for instance, where they take a deposit from buyers and pay them an interest, like a loan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Analysts say while things have worked out well so far, Oberoi Realty will now have to start buying and holding land, sooner than later. &ldquo;The question is whether they have a replenishment strategy. They have 20 million sq ft of land now, which will last them for the next five or six years. But, still, in the next one or two years, if they don&rsquo;t buy land, it will be worrisome,&rdquo; says Param Desai, senior research analyst at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;We treat land as a raw material and hence do not bank land and increase idle inventory. As and when the existing land is used up, we shall acquire further land for development either by outright purchase or joint venture mode, whatever makes business sense to the company,&rdquo; maintains Oberoi. His line of reasoning has few takers, though. &ldquo;This whole idea of buying land during a downturn is easier said than done because you don&rsquo;t know when there is a peak and there is a trough,&rdquo; cautions Religare&rsquo;s Agarwal. &ldquo;It is very tough to take a call on the cycle. The 50% margins that Oberoi has made till now came from a significant appreciation in land prices, which does not happen in a just-in time-model.&rdquo; Agarwal cites other developers such as Godrej and Prestige, who carry out joint development with land owners and make just about 30-35% in margins. The fact that Oberoi Realty&rsquo;s projects have been concentrated in one location &mdash; Mumbai &mdash; is also a cause for concern, analysts point out. For volumes to grow on a consistent basis, a developer needs to have different projects in different locations as there is a limit to how much it can build and sell in one location.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Venturing out</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">As it happens, Oberoi Realty does have plans to move outside Mumbai. First up is the National Capital Region, perhaps later this year or next year. Nirmal Bang&rsquo;s Desai says one of the reasons Oberoi is looking at geographical expansion is because it has not been able to close any land deal in Mumbai. He feels that it will be difficult for the company to expand outside Mumbai. &ldquo;They can make some amount of money but it will not be easy to go to NCR or Bengaluru.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Whether that is indeed the reason or it&rsquo;s a natural progression for any real estate company, Oberoi is certainly looking outward. But with a difference. The model the company follow in NCR is a joint development model, where it will partner with a land owner and enter into a revenue or profit sharing agreement. Oberoi hopes to replicate the experience it had with mixed use development at Worli, an ongoing joint venture with the Sahana Group. While the model sounds good on paper, Oberoi could face problems in getting a partner on ground, since there are not many land owners in the NCR region who want to partner with a developer, according to Agarwal, &ldquo;Even developers such as Sobha and Godrej who have entered the NCR market have found it difficult to get joint development partners, so it may not be an easy ride.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Proving naysayers wrong will be crucial if the company is to build on its initial successes, and deliver returns for its investors. Oberoi Realty caught investors&rsquo; fancy in January, 2007, when in one of the biggest foreign direct investments in the India property sector, Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s real estate arm bought a 10.75% stake in the company for Rs 675 crore. Oberoi then went in for an IPO in October 2010, raising Rs 1,000 crore. The stock now trades at Rs 233, below its issue price of Rs 260, and investors are waiting for a trigger. &ldquo;The stock has been stagnant for quite some time now because there really hasn&rsquo;t been any new development for the stock to move up,&rdquo; says Agarwal.</p>\n<p class="p3">The company has around Rs 1,072 crore of cash on its books, which it had planned to use to buy land. Currently, it is invested in bank deposits and mutual funds, earning returns of 8-10% &mdash; and Oberoi appears to be in no hurry. He wants to stick to his philosophy of buying land during a downturn. Analysts agree that right now there aren&rsquo;t many options available for land buyers to pick up tracts at attractive prices. Nirmal Bang&rsquo;s Desai says there has been a slowdown in the Mumbai market in terms of demand for homes but it has not resulted in a price correction in the end product or land prices. &ldquo;In fact, land prices have gone up because of which Oberoi Realty has not been able to close any land deal. They are still looking out for land acquisitions. They don&rsquo;t want to be aggressive and will wait it out for one or two years.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Certainly, Oberoi has a few issues to take care of before he replicates the company&rsquo;s early wins. The company has an unsold inventory of 1 million sq ft. &ldquo;Oberoi has failed in winning land bids but that is also because they are conservative. They were bidding for HUL land in Andheri and DLF land in Lower Parel but they did not want to buy DLF land at more than Rs 2,000 crore. Considering the kind of oversupply Lower Parel is seeing, it makes sense for Oberoi to be conservative,&rdquo; says Desai. Vikas Oberoi likes to play the waiting game. It has paid off in the past and his investors might as well get used to it. Trees don&rsquo;t grow to the sky and the same could be true for land prices in Mumbai.&nbsp;</p>', 'Mumbai''s Oberoi Realty has relied on some very smart moves and a fair share of luck; to strike it big in the real estate business.

(337, 16, '', 'The cookie trail', '<p class="p1">Why have a good day when you can have a great day!&rdquo; The line evokes a mild chuckle from Nikhil Sen, managing director of the Bengaluru-based Unibic India. It was, after all, aimed at his former employer, Britannia, where he served for over two decades before resigning as its chief operating officer in January 2005. This headline of Unibic&rsquo;s tongue-in-cheek print campaign in 2007 that clearly took potshots at Britannia&rsquo;s leading brand Good Day, raised the ire of its promoter Nusli Wadia, who eventually secured a legal injunction and restraining order against the Unibic campaign.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Since then, Sen has known better than to take his entrenched and deep-pocketed competitors head-on. Instead, he has focused on growing the virtually unknown Australian cookie brand&rsquo;s presence in India, one crunchy nibble at a time. The result &mdash; a small but significant bite from the premium end (10%) of the Rs 16,500 crore biscuits business. In FY13, Unibic clocked close to Rs 100 crore in revenues, according to Sen, and is well on its way to turn profitable this year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>How the cookie crumbles- Graphics</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Cookies are a more recent phenomenon in the traditional Indian biscuits market, dominated by the hard glucose variety. Till about seven-eight years ago, the Indian consumer could only choose between biscuits priced under Rs 10 and imported brands priced upwards of Rs 100 a pack. Unibic went for the mid to premium end of the biscuits market, where cookies and value-added biscuit variants fit in.&ldquo;We are placed somewhere between Britannia&rsquo;s Good Day and expensive imported cookies,&rdquo; says Sen. The pricing of Unibic&rsquo;s products reflects this approach. For instance, a 150-gm pack of Unibic&rsquo;s cashew butter cookies is priced at Rs 34, a premium of 36% over Britannia&rsquo;s Good Day cashew cookies at Rs 25. Similarly, while ITC Foods&rsquo; Sunfeast Dark Fantasy is priced at Rs 25 for 100 gm, a 90-gm pack of Unibic&rsquo;s Choco Kiss sells for Rs 30 &mdash; a 20% premium. It&rsquo;s a fairly narrow price band that Unibic straddles now but also one that&rsquo;s growing faster than other biscuit segments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It is Britannia, though, that&rsquo;s credited with creating the cookies category in India with the launch of Good Day in 1986. It still rules the cookie market along with Parle&rsquo;s Hide &amp; Seek that came in 1998. The premium end saw renewed action from mid 2005, when ITC Foods launched Sunfeast Dark Fantasy, a premium cream biscuit. Later, Oreo from Cadbury India and McVities from United Biscuits joined the cookie bandwagon. So, what&rsquo;s Unibic doing to protect its niche and taste sweet success?</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>A slow bake</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Unibic was incorporated in India in August 2004 as a joint venture between premium cookies maker Unibic Australia and Dhruv Deepak Saxena, a Melbourne-based serial entrepreneur, who has since exited the business. The company started operations in March 2005 importing two cookie brands, Anzac (oatmeal)&nbsp; and Bradman (chocolate chip), from Unibic Australia. By late 2005, its manufacturing unit in India was up and running, producing cookies at costs that were as much as 40% lower than procuring them from Australia. A five-year deal with Amalgamated Bean Coffee Trading Co for supplies to its Caf&eacute; Coffee Day outlets came as a shot in the arm for Unibic India. It went on a marketing overdrive, spending Rs 7.5 crore on advertising and promotions in 2006. Around 60% of this was for television commercials aired on southern regional and national channels. The rest was on association with sports events and cricket, where it brought the Unibic Bradman 20/20 tournament to India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">By early 2007, Sen was on board with sweat equity, as COO. Soon after, it established a retail and distribution presence in a few southern states, and bagged an export deal from Australian supermarket Coles. This was also the time that US-based private equity firm Lighthouse Capital picked up a reported 20% stake in the company. The next few years saw the company further consolidate its presence in South India, sign on Australian supermarket chain Woolsworth as a customer, and receive an eligibility certificate by the British Retail Consortium for exporting cookies to the UK market. Its private label business had begun to grow by now, as well. By 2010, its revenues had reportedly touched Rs 60 crore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Unibic&rsquo;s fresh-off-the-oven success caught the fancy of FMCG major Marico, which evinced interest for a 51% stake in the company in late 2010. The protracted talks eventually fell through, and in 2011, Lazard India Private Equity picked up Unibic Australia&rsquo;s majority share in the Indian holdings. Yet again, in late 2012, private equity firm Peepul Capital bought out Lazard private equity&rsquo;s majority stake in Unibic India for a reported Rs 100 crore. Its current owners now include Peepul Capital and Lighthouse Capital, with Sen&rsquo;s holdings said to be in the 10-15% range. The Indian business continues to pay a nominal royalty to Unibic Australia for use of the brand.</p>\n<p class="p3">Armed with sufficient funds, this time around Unibic is betting on a favourable environment to grow faster than it has so far. Its timing could be just right. The composition of India&rsquo;s biscuits market has changed significantly over the past couple of years with the share of glucose biscuits, traditionally the largest selling category, coming down. In fact, the cookie market in India became larger at 26.2% with glucose at 19.3%, as per Nielsen data for the July-September quarter of 2012. Cream biscuits, the other major category is the second largest, accounting for 22.2% share. It&rsquo;s a significant development for cookie brands since, in 2010, glucose biscuits were leading the market with a 26.5% share, while cookies and cream biscuits trailed behind at 23.8% and 16.6%, respectively.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Cookies were considered a special occasion treat earlier but now the market is flooded with new offerings" - Harminder Sahni, founder, Wazir Consulting</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">This happened because biscuits makers such as Parle, Britannia, Surya Foods &amp; Agro and ITC Foods introduced a slew of non-glucose products, in pursuit of higher margins. According to research and investment advisory firm Espirito Santo, non-glucose products bring in at least 10% higher margins for biscuit makers. And, being an under-tapped market, growth in the premium segment &mdash; cookies and cream biscuits &mdash; far outstrips the mass glucose segment. &ldquo;The category is evolving. Cookies were considered a special occasion treat earlier but now biscuits makers have flooded the market with new offerings and customers are willing to spend a little more if they find the proposition to be value-for-money,&rdquo; says Harminder Sahni, founder of Wazir Consulting, a Gurgaon-based retail advisory firm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Already, Unibic cookies are being retailed through more than 100,000 outlets, says Sen. That&rsquo;s still limited, compared with the distribution reach of heavyweights like Parle (3.3 million outlets), Britannia (3.5 million outlets) and ITC (2 million outlets), although strictly speaking, there&rsquo;s no comparison since the biggies operate across the spectrum of the biscuits market, while Unibic is limited to a much narrower belt. Moreover, 60% of sales continue to come from south India, and the rest from metros such as Delhi and Mumbai. While Unibic&rsquo;s retail brands bring in 70% of revenues, its contract manufacturing and private label business contributes another 20-25%. It makes cookies for Caf&eacute; Coffee Day and Indigo for its onboard service, and for the private labels of Future Group for its Tasty Treat store brand and Aditya Birla Retail&rsquo;s More chain, which sells its own food products under the Feasters label. The rest comes from exports to the US, UK, New Zealand and countries in West and South East Asia.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Crunch time</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The company is yet to make profits but Sen says that will happen in FY14 when revenues are expected to touch Rs 150 crore. To achieve those numbers, though, Unibic will need to draw upon more than its Australian lineage, or even its early success recipes. Much will hinge on its ability to innovate and deliver new variants regularly. Apart from its current portfolio that includes Bradman chocolate chip cookies, Anzac oatmeal cookies, and butter, butter-cashew, choconut and Jamz cookies, Unibic India is now getting into healthy products like sugar-free and digestive oatmeal cookies as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Its factory at Huskur Road in Bengaluru has state-of-the-art machines imported from Italy with two oven lines working at 75% capacity. Sen says the processes employed to make its cookies lend an authentic texture. Claiming to be the first biscuit maker in India to use wire cut technology in baking cookies, he adds that it&rsquo;s the only method available to make cookies softer and chewy, unlike biscuits. Biscuits are typically made through sheeting and cutting or rotary moulding. In sheeting and cutting, the dough is passed through rollers to get the desired thickness and then cut using plastic or metal dies. The dough has to be kept hard so that it retains its shape when the extra scrap is being removed after. In rotary moulds, the dough needs to be compressed into dies or slots mounted on a roller with extra dough being scraped off. The dough needs to be stiff here as well for the biscuits to retain their shape. In wire cut technology, the short dough or much softer dough is extruded through a die and cut by wires at regular intervals without being pressed by rollers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Images- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Cookies are amongst the biggest categories for private labels and make for upwards of 20% of modern retailers&rsquo; overall sales, informs Sen who is banking on the private labels business to fuel the next round of growth for Unibic.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s some time away, as modern retailers get their act together, and the effects of FDI in multibrand retail kick in. &ldquo;Not many big retailers are profitable. They have massive stores in high rental locations. They need to figure out how to make profits first. Expansion will come after that,&rdquo; says Sen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">He still sees merit in selling to such retailers, though, as the learnings from such relationships will help improve Unibic&rsquo;s processes. &ldquo;The more these international players come in, more people like us will benefit. Abroad, you deliver your goods to stores with appointment. This means that if your delivery truck misses its appointment it has to wait a while to deliver goods. This, in turn, means that truck guys will start arriving at our factories on time, we will ensure loading on time and so on. The entire system becomes more efficient,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With growth in the cookie market estimated at 20-25%, Sen expects Unibic&rsquo;s business to grow faster at 35% in the near future. It is lining up new products such as <em>chyavanprash</em> based and a sugar-free cookies, even as it works on growing reach among the top 20% population towns. &ldquo;Expanding distribution is key for us and we are working on it diligently,&rdquo; he says. The target is to eventually have a pan-India presence, especially by increasing retail reach in north Indian cities such as Jaipur and Chandigarh, and in cities such as Pune and Nasik in the West, by the end of the current financial year.</p>\n<p class="p3">This also means that advertising will be limited to print and event sponsorships, for now. Sen says the focus is strictly on below-the-line (BTL) activities such as in-store promotions and on social media outreach. Research and stock broking firm Edelweiss Capital expects the company to do well despite stiff competition in the category. &ldquo;On account of consistent and superior quality of products, we believe Unibic can capture a niche space for itself,&rdquo; say Abneesh Roy and Harsh Mehta in an earlier report.</p>\n<p class="p3">Capacity expansion isn&rsquo;t an issue for now, and Sen says the Bengaluru factory can handle much more volumes without having to go in for significant capacity addition. In any case, a third oven line is being considered at the current factory premises during this fiscal year. If there is a sense of urgency to grow, Sen isn&rsquo;t showing it. Having played by the classic marketing rulebook so far, it&rsquo;s evident that the sharp focus and measured pace are here to stay. And so is the value proposition. &ldquo;We will never be a mass-market brand,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>', 'Innovative products and a wider reach hold the key to unlocking Unibic India''s fortunes in the mid-premium cookie market', '29', '', 0, '', 'the-cookie-trail-337', 331, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'The cookie trail', 'Innovative products and a wider reach hold the key to unlocking Unibic India''s fortunes in the mid-premium cookie market', '', '', '', 'Unibic India,Britannia''s,ITC Foods', 0, NULL, '2015-01-30 16:49:30', '2015-01-30 18:07:27', '2013-06-22', 0),

Bargain hunting might have driven the move rather than an attempt to support the stock which has been under severe pressure lately. The stock has declined 22% from Rs 46 to Rs 36 over the past month after news surfaced about the Income Tax conducting raids on Kapoor&rsquo;s office and residence. The tax department claims that Balaji Telefilms has evaded tax to the tune of Rs 30 crore by inflating expenses. Pending disputes with the Commissioner of Service Tax as well as the Department of Sales Tax might also be playing on the mind of investors. The performance in FY13 has not provided much cheer either. Consolidated income for FY13 was flat at Rs 186 crore and net profit was down to Rs 14.58 crore from Rs 20.44 crore in the previous year.

The pressure on the rupee has been a function of the current account deficit (CAD), which is expected to be 5% in FY13. The comfort level for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as far as the CAD is concerned is 2.5%. While some relief is expected in FY14 if crude prices continue to trade around the $100 level, does it justify the current rally? Why aren&rsquo;t FIIs, who have traditionally&nbsp; driven the market taking a more cautious stance?</p>\n<p class="p3">So far, the RBI has been banking on fickle capital inflows to cover the deficit but how prudent is it to assume that the flows will continue. Despite getting flows of $11 billion in CY13, the currency has weakened but the market has paid little heed. Dharmesh Mehta, who heads the institutional equities desk at Axis Capital feels the weakening rupee didn&rsquo;t dampen inflows for a couple of reasons. &ldquo;An increase in India&rsquo;s weightage in the MSCI Index meant more allocation.&rdquo; The second reason he says, &ldquo;New foreign investors are able to buy more for the same dollar.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The markets have now got so addicted to easy liquidity that any news of scaling back sends it into a tizzy. So, even though outgoing Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke has indicated, &ldquo;A premature withdrawal of stimulus efforts would put the economic recovery at risk,&rdquo; the dollar has displayed unusual strength against other major currencies. &ldquo;The last one month has been more about the strengthening of the dollar rather than the weakening of the rupee,&rdquo; says Alchemy Capital&rsquo;s chief investment officer Hiren Ved. &ldquo;It is not just the rupee that has taken a hit, other Asian currencies have also lost ground,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Of course, if the weakening trend of the rupee persists, it will not only eat into the return of existing FIIs but put on hold new inflows. Alchemy&rsquo;s Ved explains that foreign investors are assuming that the dollar will trade in the Rs 53 to Rs 56 range. &ldquo;Anything below Rs 56 is a warning sign which could affect the market negatively. If the rupee continues to depreciate, foreign investors will wait to see the lowest possible value it can hit.&rdquo; The rupee breaching the 56 level and the RBI&rsquo;s latest hawkish tone on interest rates has created a ripple and resulted in a 2.5% correction in the Sensex.

(340, 20, '', 'Revisiting the basics with Aswath', '<p class="p1">In most professional interactions, the terms &lsquo;investment strategy&rsquo; and &lsquo;investment philosophy&rsquo; are interchangeably used. So, they must mean the same, right? &ldquo;Wrong,&rdquo; says Aswath Damodaran and that is why at the last IAIP-CFA Institute annual event, the valuation expert spoke on how the two differ.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, is a familiar name for those who invest for a living. However, at the opening of his presentation, he said, &ldquo;In the 25 years of being around money managers, I have frequently been asking them one question to which I don&rsquo;t get a good answer and the question is, &lsquo;What is your investment philosophy&rsquo;?&rdquo; He adds that many portfolio managers do not have a core philosophy and for an investment philosophy to work, it has to fit your strengths and weaknesses and your perspective as a human being.</p>\n<p class="p3">But, what exactly is an investment philosophy and how is it different from an investment strategy? According to Damodaran, an investment philosophy &ldquo;is a core set of beliefs about markets, a behavioural set of assumptions about how markets work, how they fail to work, and how to take advantage of common mistakes made by investors in the markets. This is as opposed to an investment strategy, such as buying low price to earnings stocks or going contrarian.&rdquo; And why does one need an investment philosophy? Because without it, your portfolio is going to swing from one strategy to another, based on what worked best recently, leading to a huge turnover ratio, large transaction costs and poor returns.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Obviously, there is no one investment philosophy that fits us all. As Damodaran points out, &ldquo;You cannot read a book on Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch and invest like them. To be a successful investor you don&rsquo;t have to understand Buffett or Lynch, you have to understand yourself.&rdquo; The temperament part aside, a common investment philosophy is impractical because risk aversion, time horizon and tax considerations vary from investor to investor.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Different strokes for different folks- Graphics</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The time horizon aspect is the trickiest for professional money managers. When you invest other people&rsquo;s money, it is not the fund manager&rsquo;s time horizon but the client&rsquo;s time horizon that matters. One cannot undertake a contrarian or deep value style of investing if the client&rsquo;s time horizon is three months. This is why it is critical for them to have investors who understand and appreciate their investment philosophy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Now that the terms contrarian and deep value have crept in, let&rsquo;s take a closer look at different investment philosophies. The first investment philosophy that Damodaran discusses is intrinsic value investing and in this fall two types of investors &mdash; value and growth investors.&nbsp; The primary difference between value and growth investors is that value investors have an inherent suspicion about growth and want to buy a company for less than the value of assets in place. For value investors, growth is the icing on the cake. Growth investors, on the other hand, believe they can find companies where the market is underpricing growth.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Crossing the chasm&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">As an intrinsic value investor, you might think you just bought a bargain, but that is where your troubles start. Damodaran reminds all those following the intrinsic value philosophy that, &ldquo;The price is a given, the value is an estimate.&rdquo; One of the problems that intrinsic value investors face is the gap that exists between value and price. A company&rsquo;s value is derived from the cash flows generated from existing investments, the growth expected to be generated from those cash flows and the inherent risks in them. On the other side, market pricing of a security is a far more complex process driven by demand and supply, which in turn, is driven from everything ranging from behavioural factors, momentum and available liquidity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Having mentioned momentum and liquidity, Damodaran brings in a couple of other investing philosophies, namely technical analysts and arbitrageurs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The followers of these schools of thought are mostly concerned with price and care little about value. Likewise value investors, too, don&rsquo;t obsess much with respect to the future when they buy as they believe that price will eventually converge with value. However, to make money consistently in the markets one has to understand the price and value equation and the gap between perceived value and market price has to narrow.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Stock price drivers- Graphics</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Let&rsquo;s now take a look at price-based investment philosophies in greater detail.&nbsp; In this camp are chartists who study price movements with the help of technical indicators and use that as a basis for investing. Damodaran is of the view that a growing body of evidence backs up technical analysts&rsquo; methods. He says, &ldquo;Technical analysts are much more honest about what they are doing. They say, &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t know what the value is, but we have indicators that might tell us which direction the price is going&rsquo;.&rdquo; Then you have arbitrageurs who try to find the same asset trading at different prices in different markets and try to lock in on those price differences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Another investing philosophy that uses price as a benchmark is what Damodaran calls information traders. This set seeks to take advantage of new information that could result in a change in price. This pursuit comes with its own disadvantages, though. For one, information traders react to whatever the market does and have no anchor such as intrinsic value. Therefore, they tend to be pushed back and forth with price movements. Secondly, the key to their success lies in detecting shifts in the perception of other investors. This is next to impossible, as crowd behaviour is very tough to analyse.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Investigate and invest&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">As the session progresses, Damodaran delves on the two investment philosophies that represent the extremes in the investing process &mdash; value investors and chartists. A true value investor is someone who buys stocks for less than what they are worth and believes in focusing on assets in place rather than future assets. He further classifies value investors into three categories on the basis of their approach &mdash; passive screeners, contrarian investors and activist value investors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Passive screeners follow Benjamin Graham&rsquo;s famous tenets on screening. Graham was well ahead of his time and many of the screens that he devised delivered higher than market returns.&nbsp; Damodaran then proceeds to examine some of these screens. The first of these is price-to-book. Over a long time period there seems to be no contest: low price-to-book stocks offer higher risk-adjusted returns than high price-to-book stocks. But then comes the caveat, &ldquo;Some low price-to-book stocks deserve to trade at low price-to-book because they continue to generate terrible return on equity.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The second screen is low price-to-earnings (PE) ratio stocks that have historically delivered better returns than high PE stocks. Here, too, Damodaran offers a word of caution. &ldquo;Earnings can be manipulated, so low PE stocks aren&rsquo;t necessarily a bargain. Secondly, most low PE stocks also tend to be low growth. Not all growth creates value and earns more than the cost of capital.&rdquo; The third screen is of high dividend yield stocks. While these, too, have delivered above-average returns over a period of time, the danger here is that not all companies can sustain the rate of dividends going forward. Relying on past dividends is like driving by looking at the rear-view mirror.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Damodaran then offers the following advice. &ldquo;Look for low PE, high growth, high return on equity and low price-to-book stocks. To be a successful passive screener, you need to devise better screens and minimise transaction costs. Also double check normalised, adjusted and owners&rsquo; earnings of firms as numbers can be made to lie.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Anything goes</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The next category of value investors are contrarians who bet heavily on the losers. While this may look foolish, a study by the University of Wisconsin backs up contrarian investing. At the end of every year, the researchers took the top 50 and bottom 50 stocks of the S&amp;P Index and compared their returns over a five-year period. The losers at the start of the period actually emerged as winners after five years and it took 18 months for the momentum to shift.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The caveat here is that while the University of Wisconsin sample size may have worked, it is not as simple as it sounds. The fact remains that just because it has worked in the past does not mean that buying losers should work out in the future. Secondly, there is a risk arising from transaction costs in this style of investing. Of the 50 stocks in the study, half traded at less than a dollar, which meant transaction costs ate into excess returns.</p>\n<p class="p3">The final category of value investors are activist value investors. They buy companies with a value or pricing gap and attempt to pro-actively bridge the gap. Activist investors buy a large stake in a badly managed company and change the way it is run. They do this by squeezing existing assets more efficiently, deriving more cash flows from them and by lowering the cost of capital for the firm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Damodaran classifies this valuation scenario in situations like this into two categories. The first he calls &ldquo;status quo valuation&rdquo; where he assumes the existing management will continue to run the company. The second category is where a more able competent management takes over and brings change. This he labels &ldquo;optimum valuation&rdquo; and is only possible with good corporate governance.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Tales of human folly&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Damodaran might not use technical analysis himself but he does not dismiss it as useless mumbo-jumbo. Technical analysis assumes that price trends can be used to predict future price movements with the help of charts.&nbsp; This is because chartists assume that price is determined by the interaction of demand and supply. Technicians also assume that disregarding minor market distortions, stock prices move in trends that persist for some time and any change in trends caused by shift in demand and supply can be detected. Damodaran says a trend persists because price changes themselves may provide information to markets. &ldquo;Thus, the fact that a stock has gone up continuously may be viewed as good news by investors, making it more likely that the price will go up than down.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Two other theories of repute used extensively in charting are the Elliott Wave Theory, which states that the market moves in waves lasting from a few trades to a century on the basis of which it is possible to determine the position of the market at all times. The second is the Dow Theory, which divides market movements into three time periods &mdash; the short daily fluctuations, the fluctuations running from a few weeks to a month and the long-term four year movement in trends. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Depending on the school followed, the indicators used in technical analysis vary. The contrarian school here is of the view that as people overreact to news, extreme movements in stock prices will be followed by more extreme movements in the reverse direction. Indicators used in conjunction with this belief are support and resistance lines, moving averages and volume indicators. Secondly, markets learn slowly and some investors are sharper than the market and thus make excess returns. Indicators used to take advantage of such price drifts include the relative strength index and trend lines.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Here, too, Damodaran has a few pearls of wisdom for those intending to punt on the basis of the charts.&nbsp; &ldquo;The success of these strategies depends upon timely trading. As an investor you need to monitor prices closely and look for triggers. It is also essential to back test the indicator being used to ensure that it delivers the returns expected.&rdquo; In a sense he says &ldquo;we are all market timers, and there lies the problem. When everyone tries to do it, it is difficult to win.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Peek inside</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">As far as his personal investing is concerned, Damodaran says his portfolio gets revalued every year. He says, &ldquo;I hold about 45 stocks and value everything every year. Every stock has to justify being held based on what the value is today, not what it has done for me.&rdquo; Clearly Damodaran is not sentimental about what he holds and applies exacting valuation standards to his portfolio, &ldquo;If you have a well thought out valuation, every number should have a story behind it. You need to justify why the number is what it is.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">If he has a grouse, it is more to do with the disproportionate time that is spent talking about buying stocks than being told to sell them. &ldquo;When you look at the time spent talking about what to buy and when to sell, the time spent is asymmetric. You almost never hear talk about when you should sell.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>', 'Valuation guru Aswath Damodaran on the difference between an investment philosophy and investment strategy', '11', '', 0, '', 'revisiting-the-basics-with-aswath-340', 334, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Revisiting the basics with Aswath ', 'Valuation guru Aswath Damodaran on the difference between an investment philosophy and investment strategy', '', '', '', 'Valuation,Aswath Damodaran,Investment philosophy,Investment strategy,Value investors,Growth investors,Contrarians,Activist value investors,Elliot Wave Theory,Dow Theory', 0, NULL, '2015-01-30 18:27:02', '2015-01-30 18:49:21', '2013-06-22', 0),

It&rsquo;s a small luxury the 58-year-old chairman of Mukand allows himself now. &ldquo;In my younger days I put my heart and soul into the game,&rdquo; says Bajaj, who is also one of the promoters of the Rahul Bajaj-chaired Bajaj Group, with 40,000 employees and a market capitalisation of Rs 80,000 crore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In a well-lit room in his Peddar Road apartment in Mumbai, a collection of his mother&rsquo;s old sitars adorn a wall, while a book collection lines up another wall.

Bajaj even led the team as captain for four years in world championships, the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">At 22, as fast as he had risen to the top of the game, Bajaj suddenly decided to quit professional table tennis in 1977 &mdash; he was ranked world No. 7 at the time. &ldquo;I decided it was the best time to quit when I was at the top of the game,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;My family did not like my decision, though.&rdquo; Two years later, he left for the US to pursue his management degree from Harvard Business School and then joined the family business, starting with Bajaj Auto.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Now, thanks to his sporting streak, the Bajaj Group sponsors table tennis tournaments in Mumbai and has funded Olympic Gold Quest (OGQ), an initiative started by billiards champion Geet Sethi and ace Indian shuttler Prakash Padukone, with Bajaj as one of the directors. &ldquo;We have talent in the country but not enough resources to train players. OGQ is committed to bridge the gap between Indian champions and world champions, to help the country win Olympic Medals,&rdquo; explains Bajaj, who&rsquo;s also a recipient of the country&rsquo;s highest sports honour, the Arjuna Award, and Maharashtra&rsquo;s Shiv Chhatrapati Award.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Being a sportsperson has made him more disciplined and optimistic in general, Bajaj says. Now, weighing 30 kg more than during his sporting days, the only opponent he plays against is son Nirav, who&rsquo;s studying at Brunel University in London, and comes visiting often. &ldquo;We have a lot of fun. Whenever he is at home, I grab him for a game or two,&rdquo; says Bajaj, who always gives his son the benefit of a few points before starting. &ldquo;Every match should be fair and square,&rdquo; he smiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>', 'A former national table tennis champion, Niraj Bajaj, continues to find the game invigorating', '22', '', 0, '', 'still-in-the-game-342', 336, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Still in the game', 'A former national table tennis champion, Niraj Bajaj, continues to find the game invigorating', '', '', '', 'Niraj Bajaj,Bajaj Group,Table tennis', 0, NULL, '2015-01-30 18:55:56', '2015-01-30 19:08:11', '2013-06-22', 0),
(343, 24, '', 'Oversimplified, over-optimistic', '<p class="p1">A board member of a global credit card company once commented, &ldquo;I never read business books. They are written by people who don&rsquo;t do business. I prefer Harry Potter.&rdquo; She reflected the view that many business books push simplified frameworks rather than acknowledge the complexities of the world and the necessity of solid research and a multi-stakeholder view.</p>\n<p class="p3"><em>Conscious Capitalism</em>, co-authored by John Mackey, co-CEO of Whole Foods Market, and Raj Sisodia, professor of marketing at Bentley University, raises valid points about &lsquo;heroic entrepreneurs&rsquo; and &lsquo;conscious companies&rsquo; that are &lsquo;butterflies&rsquo; as opposed to the normal &lsquo;caterpillar&rsquo; companies, focused only on profit optimisation and shareholder value. However, it promotes an oversimplified, US-centric framework, which makes it a somewhat lengthy read.</p>\n<p class="p3">A key tenet of the book is the belief in the goodness of the capitalist system and the &lsquo;real&rsquo; capitalist entrepreneur. As the authors put it, &ldquo;Business is good because it creates value, it is ethical because it is based on voluntary exchange, it is noble because it can elevate our existence, and it is heroic because it lifts people out of poverty and creates prosperity&rdquo;. Conscious entrepreneurs are not driven by profit maximisation but understand that sustainable business requires the creation of win-win solutions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Mackey and Sisodia describe leaders who are motivated by the firm&rsquo;s higher purpose of creating value for all stakeholders rather than by the size of their paycheque. Whole Foods Market, for example, caps leadership compensation at 1:19 of average team member salary versus the 1:351 ratio that is the US average. Compensation across the company&rsquo;s top leadership team is equal, and 93% of its stock options are distributed to regular employees, against the common practice in the US where 75% of all stock options go to the top five people.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Conscious culture and management revolves around decentralisation, empowerment and collaboration. An example that illustrates such a culture is that of a Whole Foods market employee on Christmas Eve. Faced with an approaching snowstorm and a breakdown in the store&rsquo;s billing system, he decided to give food free to customers. The loss was $4,000, but the subsequent media resonance that grateful customers created outweighed the investment.</p>\n<p class="p3">The profits of conscious companies are above normal, according to Mackey and Sisodia, since they spend on team member happiness, a great customer experience and high quality products but save on frequent sales promotions, high levels of team member turnover and administrative overheads. The assumption of enlightened human beings driving the progress of such companies and re-inventing capitalism in a conscious way, however, seems overly optimistic. Checks are necessary to keep &lsquo;caterpillars&rsquo; from harming stakeholders and the environment, and governments have a very important role to play. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Lastly, even butterflies may have spots on their wings. The SEC investigation against Mackey (he blogged under a false name against a competitor he was in the middle of a takeover battle with, and which was later acquired by Whole Foods Market) is mentioned. Not surprisingly, described only from his point of view. <span class="s3"><br /></span></p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Insights</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Mum is the word</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1">It seems only logical that managers wouldn&rsquo;t be too keen to spread bad news about their companies, an idea that&rsquo;s supported by theory, disclosure patterns and survey responses. But it&rsquo;s not so simple when it comes to industry-wide bad news, since if even one firm chooses to disclose the information, it goes public. So, when would managers keep mum? Collusion, according to a study by <strong>Jonathan L Rogers</strong>, <strong>Catherine Schrand</strong> and <strong>Sarah LC Zachman</strong>, is more likely in industries with significant equity incentives and depends on what managers believe are the incentives of other firms in the industry to cooperate. The study took into account 735 possible industry-year combinations and found only 11-18 collusion cases.

(344, 24, '', 'The McLuxury connundrum', '<p class="p1">Some years back, two friends got together to start a bespoke couture business with a petty investment that wouldn&rsquo;t cover a driver&rsquo;s salary today. Though they continue to revel in their anonymity, they spend their working day measuring up their famously discreet clients at a farmhouse in Chhatarpur, New Delhi, for one-of-a-kind heritage clothes. And the very rich, far removed from the stranglehold of brands, pay extraordinary sums of money for clothes that, no doubt, they will wear just once, but can be assured of both confidentiality as well as exclusivity, something mass luxury brands arguably no longer offer.</p>\n<p class="p3">Even as made-to-measure, offered by most fashion brands, becomes popular in India, the country&rsquo;s rich are beginning to wonder what constitutes luxury? According to the dictionaries, luxury is something that &ldquo;is inessential but conducive to pleasure&rdquo;, &ldquo;an indulgence rather than a necessity&rdquo;, but also something that may be &ldquo;rare and expensive&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s no gainsaying that luxury goods were once the privilege of a select clientele &mdash; the jade cups that Chinese emperors cherished, the <em>jamewars</em> of India that were coveted throughout Europe, the Faberg&eacute; eggs of Russia, Bohemian crystal, or rare gemstones &mdash; embodying the finest that could be afforded by a very few.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Luxury brands were conceived from this platform, though the idea received a boost when the Japanese economy powered their rush in the 1970s, fuelling an appetite for bags and shoes, watches and clothes, automobiles and yachts, leading to aggressive expansions to wherever there were opportunities for aspirational markets around the world. As brands pushed their benchmarks, they also bargained away the one factor that made luxury indispensable &mdash; their exclusivity. With the arrival of mass luxury in today&rsquo;s environment, a kid fresh off the block on a first job can walk into a Louis Vuitton store and out with an entry level bag, entering the spiffy world of millionaires and billionaires. While this means that more luxury bags (as an example) are being sold than ever before, does it truly connote luxury, or is it merely the triumph of a brand&rsquo;s appeal and marketability?</p>\n<p class="p3">Patrons of luxury began to question the premise of mass luxury a decade ago as markets in China, Brazil, West Asia, and now India, have taken the wind out of their sails. India&rsquo;s well-entrenched bespoke tradition, alas, fell victim to the arrival of the luxury brands and from master-cutters at tailoring establishments to embroiderers and master handcraftsmen all but disappeared. With few exceptions, the made-to-measure shoe business closed its shutters. The <em>karigars</em> who made jewellery for families, or embellished their clothes, in a relationship that went back generations, relinquished it for a globalised market.</p>\n<p class="p3">It is ironical, therefore, that true luxury &mdash; a much-bandied term for anything expensive &mdash; should be held hostage to global practices of brand merchandise. Technology has rendered most things considered luxury redundant &mdash; so a watch-movement (unless it is hand-crafted), or a garment silhouette (unless it is a drape), or an automobile engine (the most you can say about a car these days is that it is distinctive for its shape, or seats, or dashboard) &mdash; so in the sameness of products, it is to the old-fashioned, handmade way of things that billionaire clients are turning. Not brands, but family traditions that have survived, a passion for designing so each piece, or ware, becomes unique.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">How has India fared in all this? Analysts agree that the luxury brand market is still at the tip of its iceberg in the country. Which means that this decade alone will see an explosion of stores and brands across what were once considered conservative markets such as Chennai, or tier 2 cities such as Indore, even as they entrench themselves deeper in Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru. Even as luxury democratises and offers up the one thing that distinguished it &mdash; distinction from other people &mdash; it is resorting to a identicalness that mocks its very existence.

(347, 12, '', 'New-age kiosk', '<p class="p1">"Serendipity,&rdquo; exclaims Vijay Radhakrishnan, when asked about how Magzter, the company he co-founded with Girish Ramdas and is CTO of, came about. A self-confessed tech geek, Radhakrishnan was attending an Apple roadshow in Bangalore in 2008 to showcase its new mobile handset, the iPhone. Apple executives spoke of how they planned to develop an apps ecosystem built on the iOS platform. At the time, recalls Radhakrishnan, there were only 100 or so apps and the executives told him how all the developers were already millionaires. &ldquo;That definitely caught my attention,&rdquo; he says with a smile. &ldquo;I went back and told Girish that we should definitely start focusing on developing mobile applications since there was a lot of potential there.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">At the time, Radhakrishnan and Ramdas were working with Dotcom Infoway, an IT services company the latter had started in 2000 and into which Radhakrishnan had merged his own network management firm five to six years later. The first app Radhakrishnan and Ramdas developed was for Galatta, an online cinema portal focused on the South Indian movie industry that Ramdas had launched in 2000. In 2007, the portal came out with a print magazine, <em>Galatta Cinema</em>. In the first year itself, the app which allowed viewers to get the latest news and gossip from Kollywood was downloaded over 100,000 times. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when we decided to make app development one of our offerings,&rdquo; says Ramdas, chief executive officer and co-founder, Magzter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In 2010, Apple launched its iPad tablet and the Android operating system, too, began making its presence felt. Accordingly, Ramdas and Radhakrishnan launched versions of their app for Android as well as the iPad. They also started getting clients who wanted apps developed &mdash; operating as a division of Dotcom Infoway, their apps business developed over 300 apps between 2009 and 2011. The eureka moment, though, came from Galatta and the realisation that developing apps for different technology platforms can be daunting for a publishing company. &ldquo;If one magazine had this problem, then almost everyone would face the same issues. So, we wanted to make a product that would solve the problem and go global with it,&rdquo; says Ramdas. Thus, Magzter was born in May 2011 with an initial investment of #2 crore from the founders&rsquo; own savings. The product was launched a month later with Ramdas and Radhakrishnan moving to New York &mdash; the Mecca of publishing &mdash; and setting up headquarters there. It currently operates out of New York and Chennai, where the bulk of its 50-member team is based.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">So, what does Magzter do? Essentially, it is a cloud-based system that allows publishers to upload magazines in digital form. It has a soon-to-be patented technology called &ldquo;<em>orey</em> (Tamil for &lsquo;just one&rsquo;) click publishing&rdquo;, which allows publishers to upload content that is then published over multiple formats almost instantly. Once publishers sign up and create their account with Magzter, they can upload PDF files of magazine pages whenever they want to distribute them digitally. The publisher doesn&rsquo;t have to pay for anything &mdash; Magzter works on a shared subscription revenue model (more on that later).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Consumers, too, get the app for free and it works across different technology platforms, from iOS and Android to Microsoft Windows and Kindle Fire. They can buy the magazine of their choice from Magzter and read it across five devices. &ldquo;Nowadays, everyone at home has a tablet or smartphone of their own. So, all of them can read it on their own device. It is pretty much how we buy a physical copy of a newspaper or magazine and the entire family reads it,&rdquo; explains Ramdas. From 35 magazines in 2011, Magzter now has 2,000 magazines in 17 languages across 30 countries. That includes leading publishers worldwide &mdash; the Hearst group (<em>Cosmopolitan</em>, <em>Marie Claire</em>, <em>Seventeen</em>, <em>Good Housekeeping</em>), <em>Newsweek</em>, <em>Maxim</em>, <em>Fast Company</em>, Outlook India (which publishes <span class="s1"><em>Outlook </em></span><em>Business</em>, among others), Living Media (<em>India Today</em>) and Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co (<em>Femina</em>, <em>Filmfare </em>and <em>Top Gear</em>) are some of the publishers that have tied up with Magzter. All those together have brought in 10 million subscribers already and Magzter says it is adding 1 million new subscribers every month. Of the 10 million, 3 million are from India, an equal number from the United States and the rest from Asia and Europe (mostly the UK).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Gaining popularity</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Magzter took off in India from the beginning. In just three months of its launch, it had surpassed Angry Birds as the most popular download in India from Apple&rsquo;s app store. The first round of funding came from Kalaari Capital, which invested $3 million in 2012. &ldquo;The bet on Magzter is on the overall mobility space. The introduction of smartphones and tablets has changed the way information is being consumed,&rdquo; says Rajesh Raju, managing director, Kalaari Capital. He adds that magazine publishers are taking proactive steps in getting their digital strategy right because they don&rsquo;t want to be caught on the wrong foot, as Western newspapers were by the online boom. Now, Magzter is in talks with a group of investors (including Kalaari) to raise a second round of funding of $10 million. This will be used to increase its footprint in the US as well as in emerging markets like Brazil, Russia and China.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"The introduction of smartphones and tablets has changed the way information is consumed" - Rajesh Raju, managing director, Kalaari Capital</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">There&rsquo;s plenty of competition in Magzter&rsquo;s field. Apart from publishers&rsquo; own apps, there are several strong players in the content aggregation business as well &mdash; Apple Newsstand, Kindle Newsstand on Amazon, and the oldest aggregator, San Francisco-based Zinio. How does Magzter stand out in this crowd? First, it works across platforms &mdash; Apple Newsstand is available only on Apple devices, while Kindle Newsstand only works on the Kindle Fire. Besides, many of the magazines on the Apple Newsstand &mdash; such as <em>Lonely Planet India</em>, <em>GQ India </em>and <em>Cosmopolitan India</em> &mdash; are powered by Magzter, which handles their digital strategy, technology and payment platforms, so Ramdas and Radhakrishnan don&rsquo;t consider Apple Newsstand a competitor. &ldquo;We power 30% of the content on Apple Newsstand,&rdquo; says Ramdas.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">What also works in Magzter&rsquo;s favour is its large presence in emerging markets, which global publications are increasingly eyeing as growth slows to a crawl in developed markets. But the real differentiator lies in the app&rsquo;s device- and platform-agnostic technology. &ldquo;This is an aggregation business and we need a strong technology and distribution platform to be a good aggregator,&rdquo; points out Radhakrishnan. And while Zinio has been in the business longer, has more titles (over 4,000 magazines at last count) and is available across the iOS and Android platforms as well, it has a big downside. Zinio charges publishers an upfront fee in addition to taking a share of the subscription revenue, which makes it more expensive than Magzter.</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>What you pay, is what you get</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">But it&rsquo;s not as if Magzter is cheap. Even if uploading content is free for publishers, the company takes half the subscription fees readers pay &mdash; and since this is from what&rsquo;s left after paying Apple&rsquo;s 30% developer fee and Android&rsquo;s 5-10%, the publisher&rsquo;s share comes down even further (about 85% of Magzter&rsquo;s revenues come from Apple customers). But it does have something more than plain vanilla content aggregation. Magzter offers publishers a dashboard that allows them to see who is downloading their magazines, how many people are reading and what their areas of interest are, which means they can not only offer more targeted content but also reach out to relevant advertisers. Magzter&rsquo;s technology also allows publishers to monetise their digital assets more effectively by allowing them to run different ads on their digital editions than what appears in the print version. Usually, digital versions of magazines are replicas of the print edition, down to the ads, but some publishers such as <em>Forbes India </em>have begun running different ads. This is possible because while the majority of content is still in PDF format (whether on Magzter or other digital news and magazine stores), some of it is now in HTML 5, which allows for interactivity. The team at Magzter has created a tool, Mag Fly, with which publishers can create fully interactive magazines that allow readers to tweet about and share their favourite articles on social media. More imporantly, from a commercial point of view, it enables e-commerce on advertisers&rsquo; sites in real time. &ldquo;This will make digital publishing more lucrative for the publishers as they can leverage their digital assets better,&rdquo; points out Ramdas.</p>\n<p class="p3">In the next couple of months, Magzter will take the battle directly onto Amazon and Apple&rsquo;s turf with the introduction of e-books. Comics and news from the RSS feeds of various publishers will also be made available. &ldquo;We want Magzter to be a reading destination and the largest reading platform online. We want to build a contextual reading platform where we go by consumers&rsquo; interests and offer things based on relevance, not source. Once we add books and comics, you can pretty much buy anything you want to read on Magzter,&rdquo; says Ramdas.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Pixel play- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In just two years, the company has grown its revenues 150 times, to over #25 crore. For publishers, going digital has proved to be a win-win situation &mdash; not only does it give them access to readers across the globe, the feared cannibalisation of print consumers isn&rsquo;t happening, either &mdash; 80% of digital consumers are first-time magazine buyers, thereby bringing in incremental revenues. With distribution and printing costs skyrocketing, making money in print has become more challenging, which makes the digital medium more lucrative in the long run. But digital publishing is still a very small fragment (less than 5%) of the $75-100 billion global print market &mdash; according to PwC, the global digital publishing market is currently estimated at $2.9 billion and will grow nearly three-fold to $8.4 billion by 2016. But much of this success will depend on how fast this new medium is adopted by publishers and consumers. Technology research firm IDC predicts that the number of smart connected devices (its term for smartphones, tablets and computers) will double from 916 million in 2011 to 1.84 billion devices in 2016. This means that the global digital publishing market is likely to grow by leaps and bounds and Magzter is all set to make the most of it.&nbsp;</p>', 'Digital readers are just a click away for magazine publishers, thanks to Magzter''s device-agnostic technology', '6', '', 0, '', 'new-age-kiosk-347', 341, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'New-age kiosk', 'Digital readers are just a click away for magazine publishers, thanks to Magzter''s device-agnostic technology', '', '', '', 'Digital publishing,Magzter,Apple Newsstand,Kindle Newsstand', 0, NULL, '2015-01-31 11:56:34', '2015-01-31 12:07:15', '2013-07-20', 0),

One third of this comes from an oleoresin derived from paprika. The Xinjiang expansion gives Synthite a leg up in sourcing high quality paprika at better prices, and tapping the China market. This has catapulted the firm into a new league, and its strategy is now the subject of an ISB and Harvard Business School case study.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Synthite&rsquo;s journey began in 1972 from Kolenchery, Jacob&rsquo;s hometown in Kerala&rsquo;s Ernakulam district. Around that time, the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) in Mysore had developed a method for isolating active ingredients in spices using steam distillation and solvent extraction processes. This held the promise of opening up new markets for Kerala&rsquo;s abundant produce of cardamom and black pepper. &ldquo;It seemed like a tremendous opportunity in the making,&rdquo; recalls Jacob, who started Synthite with Rs 10 lakh of his savings, and a Rs 30-lakh loan from Union Bank of India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The formative years were bumpy. The CFTRI technology was primitive, with limited applications for commercial use. Jacob and his R&amp;D team worked to improve upon it, but seasoning and flavouring companies in the US and Europe were not convinced about Synthite&rsquo;s ability to </span>manufacture quality products and deliver them on time. It took four years of persistent product development before Synthite&rsquo;s products got established in the business. Today, it has five processing and extraction units in India and one in China, plus an additional unit for the spice business with a total capacity of 15,000 tonne.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Among Synthite&rsquo;s key overseas customers are seasoning and flavouring firms like Givaudan, IFF, Griffith Laboratories and Kerry Group companies based in the US, UK and Germany are large buyers, but with saturation in these markets, the action has been shifting to China, Indonesia and Vietnam.</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>Unlocking flavours</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">Synthite has two oleoresin divisions &mdash; bio ingredients and spices. Its five bio ingredient units with a combined capacity of 275 tonne a day, convert raw spices (chilli, pepper, turmeric, cardamom) into oleoresins. These are supplied to flavouring and seasoning firms and they, in turn, sell seasonings and flavourings to food processing companies. Synthite has three institutional brands in the bio ingredients space &mdash; Eezee Spice, Necol and Neox &mdash; and one consumer brand, Natxtra.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">At its spice division, which came up in 2006, spices are crushed and granulated and then steam-sterilised for supply to seasoning&nbsp; companies, &mdash; including Synthite&rsquo;s subsidiary Symega, which sources 30% of its requirements from the parent &mdash; hotels, catering businesses and large canteens. Its premier brand here is Kitchen Threshers, which along with Natxtra, is sold in the consumer market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Spice-based oleoresins give a uniform flavour and aroma and are used in food products such as processed meat, noodles, beverages, sauces, canned meat, soup powders, and confectionery items. India accounts for 50% of the world oleoresin output of 18,000 tonne. Synthite is the big daddy here, accounting for 48% of India&rsquo;s oleoresin exports and 25% of global trade in the product. The next big four of the industry are Kancor Ingredients, Plant Lipids, a breakaway from Synthite run by one of Jacob&rsquo;s nephews (both in Kochi), Kalsec Natural Ingredients and Naturex, both foreign players. Worldwide, the top 10 companies account for 80% of the market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">A bulk of Synthite&rsquo;s sales come from exports to the US, Europe and the Far East, where the processed food business is well developed. &ldquo;Synthite has invested heavily in R&amp;D and process and product development and this has helped it bring down the cost of the products it sells,&rdquo; says Giridhar Rao, director, global spice network, at Griffith Laboratories, an international seasoning company, which is also a customer of Synthite.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>"Synthite has invested heavily in R&amp;D and this has helped it bring down the cost of its products" - Giridhar Rao, director, global spice network, Griffith Laboratories</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">In 2006, Synthite entered into a JV with Austria-based Omega Food Technology to form the Rs 67.1-crore Symega Savoury Technology. Symega makes seasonings and savoury ingredients that are used in snack foods, processed cheese, convenience foods and processed meats. And to gain a foothold in the confectionery flavouring segment, Synthite entered into a 50:50 JV with Aromco of the UK in 1997, making products for the bakery, beverage, confectionery, dairy, pharma and food processing sectors, including names like Nestl&eacute; and HUL. However, it plans to buy out Aromco&rsquo;s 50% shareholding in the Indian venture by October 2013, since the UK parent has been acquired by an Israeli company.</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>New recipe</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">All along, Synthite&rsquo;s main challenge has been professionalising its management as it scales up operations. Jacob informs that apart from inducting professionals into leadership roles, it has tied up with IIM-Ahmedabad to conduct leadership programs for its mid- and senior-level executives. The most unique experience so far has been setting up Synthite (Xinjiang) Biotech, the new Chinese entity. Language was, of course, a stiff cultural barrier. Finding a place to set up the office proved even more difficult &mdash; until the local municipal body helpfully vacated its 1,000 sq ft office, providing Synthite <br /> with free electricity, telephone and wi-fi connections.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">The new work culture threw up some unique challenges, and adapting took time. &ldquo;The Chinese are extremely hierarchical, with a strong sense of loyalty,&rdquo; says Jacob. In a crisis, workers there would rather listen to their Chinese manager than a more senior Indian with greater expertise. The Korla unit has 60 Chinese employees and only three Indians. Key managers from both countries are regularly sent on exchange programmes for technical and language training. Currently 300,000 tonne of paprika is being grown here. Synthite plans to develop its Korla facilities as a major export hub, and grow other raw materials like lavender, tomato and grapes there as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">While 93% of Synthite&rsquo;s turnover comes from its spice and bio ingredients divisions, the company has, over the years, also ventured into other areas such as hospitality, real estate, wind energy, farm technology and fragrances.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>Taste results</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">Synthite has set a rather ambitious target of tripling its turnover to Rs 3,000 crore by 2020. This involves increasing volume growth and adding 24,500 metric tonne of capacity along the way. Sunil Chopra, IBM distinguished professor of operations management at Kellogg Northwestern University, who co-wrote a case study on the company in March 2013, says, &ldquo;The processed food industry is set to grow exponentially in emerging markets like India.&rdquo; He points to the company&rsquo;s operational efficiency and decentralisation in decision-making, so ideas and innovations come from all levels and are accepted. This is a big plus in Synthite&rsquo;s favour going forward, he adds.</p>\n<p class="p7"><strong>Enduring bloom- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">Rao of Griffith Labs also feels it is a plausible target. &ldquo;Prices of spices have increased dramatically over the past 10 years. So, companies are seeing a four-fold jump in turnover without any significant volume growth. All Synthite has to do to achieve the target is double its volumes till 2020. Untapped markets in South and Central America, Africa and Asia offer it an opportunity to do so,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>"The processed food industry is set to grow exponentially in emerging markets like India" - Sunil Chopra, IBM professor of operations management, Kellogg School of Management</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">Raw materials make up 68% of Synthite&rsquo;s costs, and Jacob plans to buy them cheaper and process them faster. Its farm technology initiative where it is able to procure higher quality raw materials through contract farming, is an advantage. Jacob also expects the combined turnover of Symega and Aromco to multiply to Rs 500 crore by 2020 &mdash; currently the figure stands at #72 crore &mdash; by selling spices and value added seasonings to retail consumers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">But Synthite&rsquo;s speeding juggernaut could face a few potholes before it reaches its final destination. Responding to increased demand from emerging markets will be a challenge and the company has ramped up capacity in both its bio ingredients and spice divisions. But this capacity needs to be effectively utilised. Chopra says Synthite seems to have over-invested in augmenting capacity, making its underlying cost structure higher.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">And while the company is looking to enter geographies such as China, Sri Lanka and Indonesia due to their abundant supply of key raw materials, quality is not assured by mere presence, says Rao. &ldquo;They will have to work closely with farmers to assure quality,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Yields are also quite low in these countries.&rdquo; Rao adds that seasoning and flavouring firms in Europe are looking to continuously reduce their working capital budgets. For Synthite, selling products on credit will in turn impact its cash flows.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">There are some factors going in the company&rsquo;s favour too. Its new product development and research unit has been working on replacing synthetic colours with natural ones for the dairy industry. This emphasis on using natural ingredients is in line with a global shift: the US FDA and the Food Safety Standards Authority of India are both revamping their rules in favour of natural ingredients. Jacob also points to the significant growth opportunity in the size of the market. &ldquo;Per capita consumption of flavourings and seasonings is $80 in the United States, $8 in Korea, Taiwan and Australia and just $1 in India and China. This can only grow in the future.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>', 'Kerala-based flavouring company Synthite is banking on its Chinese expansion to triple revenues by 2020', '11', '', 0, '', 'spice-man-348', 342, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Spice man', 'Kerala-based flavouring company Synthite is banking on its Chinese expansion to triple revenues by 2020', '', '', '', 'Synthite,Oleoresins,Spices,Bio ingredients', 0, NULL, '2015-01-31 12:08:28', '2015-01-31 12:20:52', '2013-07-20', 0),
(349, 16, '', 'Commercial brake', '<p class="p1">Pravin Kulkarni grimaces on being told that advertising on television will become costlier very soon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so expensive as it is. How much more should we pay now?&rdquo; complains Kulkarni, Parle Products&rsquo; general manager (marketing), not really expecting an answer. Still, the buzz at media buying agencies is that in the coming months, ad rates will be hiked at least 15% across television channels. It&rsquo;s not an arbitrary move. Come October, no channel can have more than 12 minutes of advertising every hour (and that includes two minutes of promos). The exception, of course, is cricket, where a commercial break marks the end of every over.</p>\n<p class="p3">Since broadcasters are certain to face a drop in advertising revenue, they have decided to get more out of the advertiser. (<em>see: Making up for lost time</em>) &ldquo;An increase in rates is inevitable. There is no option left for us,&rdquo; concedes Rohit Gupta, president (network sales, licensing and telephony), MSM (formerly Sony Entertainment Television). But if broadcasters don&rsquo;t have options, their advertisers do &mdash; and they may not hesitate to venture beyond TV if rates become prohibitive. Kulkarni, for instance, points out that Parle Products spends as much as 80% of its media budget (around Rs 80 crore) on television. The remaining is spread across print, digital, cinema and ambient media. &ldquo;We need to look at other options. If the rate hike is going to be 15%, we could move as much as 5-10% of our spend out of television,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Making up for lost time - Graphics</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">While the cap on advertising time has always existed, broadcasters have been getting away with interpreting it as an &ldquo;average&rdquo; 12 minutes per hour, which meant they could have peak-time advertising minutes far in excess of <span class="s1">the limit. With digitisation being patchy</span>, subscription revenue will have to go up significantly to reduce broadcasters&rsquo; dependence on advertising. According to a KPMG report, the industry got a third of its total income of Rs 37,000 crore in 2012 from advertising, a ratio it maintained even the previous year, when advertising accounted for Rs 11,600 crore of a total revenue of Rs 33,000 crore. &ldquo;The current regulation puts substantial pressure on the advertising side of our business,&rdquo; agrees Gupta, whose network gets about 70% of its income from advertising.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">According to Shashi Sinha, CEO, IPG Mediabrands India, the bigger fallout of the hike will be the inability of small and medium-sized firms to advertise on TV. &ldquo;Today, there is a long tail on television and they can advertise their brands on smaller news channels. That will become difficult in the new scenario,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Gupta is not too concerned about advertisers backing off once rates are hiked. &ldquo;Television is still extremely cost-effective for the number of people it reaches out to,&rdquo; he maintains. &ldquo;That is not something one can ignore easily,&rdquo; he says.

(350, 16, '', 'All-season cleaners', '<p class="p1">Every day, more than 100 business meetings are conducted at the year-old Sofitel hotel at Mumbai&rsquo;s Bandra-Kurla Complex. These involve conversation, coffee, agreements, disagreements and, almost every time, spills and stains. &ldquo;In a hotel, such stains can lead to losing customers and also, one&rsquo;s job,&rdquo; says Sachin Kapse, the laundry manager at the Sofitel. More than a decade spent inside the laundry rooms of five-star hotels has taught Kapse a thing or two about stain removal, and how seriously it is taken there.</p>\n<p class="p3">Dirty bedsheets, used towels and stained table cloths arrive in over 20 lots daily, to be thrown into 90-kg capacity washing machines designated for different kinds of cloth. Soon enough, Diversey&rsquo;s DF1 laundry dosing machines kick into action, automatically releasing the required chemical in predefined quantities into each washer, all for a spotless wash. &ldquo;Diversey&rsquo;s products are the best when it comes to industrial cleaning,&rdquo; says Kapse. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s as good an endorsement as it gets for the world&rsquo;s second-largest maker of cleaning products. With almost all leading hotel chains &mdash; Taj, Shangri-La, ITC and Hyatt, among others &mdash; as customers, Diversey hardly needs it, though. Its India presence dates back to 1997, when it came in as DiverseyLever soon after being acquired by Unilever, globally. Later, after another acquisition by Johnson Wax Professionals in 2002, the company came to be known as Johnson Diversey. Private equity investment firm Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice (CDR) picked up 46% in the company in 2009. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Finally, in June 2011, New Jersey-based packaging solutions company Sealed Air acquired Diversey for $4.3 billion from CDR. &ldquo;Because of our traditional Sealed Air business, we operate at the production side of food, and through our Diversey business, we intervene in food and beverage plants for sanitisation,&rdquo; says Jerome Peribere, CEO, Sealed Air, explaining the synergies gained from the deal. &ldquo;We are now a farm-to-fork company.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The purchase raised many eyebrows back home and Sealed Air&rsquo;s stock declined 45% within a year and a half of the acquisition. In India, however, things began to look up. With Diversey coming into the fold, the importance of the group&rsquo;s operations in the parent&rsquo;s scheme of things finally began to grow. &ldquo;Earlier, Sealed Air&rsquo;s protective packaging was a very tiny business in India,&rdquo; says Yagmur Sagnak, president (Asia, Middle East, Africa and Turkey), Sealed Air.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The buyout catapulted the combined revenues for India to four times that of Sealed Air&rsquo;s protective packaging business alone. Of the Rs 380 crore revenues clocked in 2012 (Rs 320 crore the previous year), nearly 80% came from Diversey&rsquo;s cleaning business. Employee head count in India is up three-fold from 100 earlier. Globally too, the company reported $7.6 billion in sales in 2012, down from $8.1 billion in 2011 and up from the $4.4 billion in 2010.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In India, Diversey&rsquo;s cleaning chemicals and equipment, especially for laundry, food and floor care, are used extensively in the hotel industry &mdash; the company claims its products are used by some 350 hotel brands. &ldquo;Name any big hotel and I can assure you that they are our customers,&rdquo; says a confident Himanshu Jain, vice-president for the Indian subcontinent. In the restaurant segment, Diversey caters to 100 brands of quick-service restaurants, including global and homegrown chains like McDonald&rsquo;s, Mad Over Donuts, Haldiram&rsquo;s and Nirula&rsquo;s, several malls, Mother Dairy and educational institutions such as Manipal University.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Now, Sealed Air is becoming ambitious. This year, it expects to cross revenues of Rs 400 crore and plans to grow to three times that size by 2015. After the merger of Diversey and Sealed Air, the packaging company&rsquo;s India operations now contribute 13-14% of global revenues; that should increase to 25-30% in four or five years, says Jain. Can Sealed Air mop up the market the way it wants? &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Customised solutions</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">But first, just what does Diversey do? Essentially, it is a part of the facilities management industry. According to estimates by Virtual Info Systems, which organises the annual Clean India Show, this is a Rs 16,000-crore market. Housekeeping services account for nearly a third of the business and under this, cleaning equipment and chemicals make up Rs 1,000 crore. Sealed Air gets about 80% of its revenue from this segment (of which 50% comes from institutional and laundry (INL) business. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Hygienically speaking - Graphics</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Diversey provides chemical solutions that are used for laundry and dish-washing, as well as machines that are used to clean floors; the company also makes dosing equipment for both segments and soak tanks for kitchens. It gets about 35-40% of its income from kitchens, followed by housekeeping (15-20%), machines (20%) and finally, laundry (15%). But surprisingly, it has a wider portfolio of products for laundry than for kitchens. Jain explains why. In the hospitality industry, there is a variety of linen, each of which requires differential treatment. For instance, food and beverage linen is usually more soiled than room linen and therefore, requires more alkaline chemicals. Similarly, towels need to be softer than bedsheets and require softening chemicals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While Sealed Air sources about 50 products of its 200-strong portfolio from Europe, an important part of its India strategy is customisation. For instance, Clax, its laundry detergent for commercial use, has been re-formulated to match the hardness of water in various regions of India. Diversey&rsquo;s range of floor care machines, too, have been localised to suit Indian weather and construction conditions. &ldquo;In the West, floors are generally carpeted, but in India, one will mostly find tiles or marble flooring in hotels. So, vacuum cleaners alone are not enough,&rdquo; says Jain. Accordingly, where Diversey was earlier importing its Taksi machines from Switzerland, it is now bringing them in from Indonesia, where they have already been adapted to Asian conditions. The relaunched machines now have new features such as a vacuum-based system that does away with repeated cleaning and backtracking to pick up excess water. This, claims Sealed Air, helps save water and chemicals by up to 50% and increases productivity by 40%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Sealed Air has also introduced a machine range, Swingo, a combination of a vacuum and single disk cleaner. While the single disk cleaner washes and polishes the floor, the vacuum sucks up the water. Jain believes that this will be of particular use in malls and other crowded areas. Another product, Suma 3 in 1, has been formulated for cost-conscious consumers &mdash; it is a combination handwash, dishwash and floor cleaner.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We allocate $140 million each year to R&amp;D globally. Now, more funds will be allocated to India" - Jerome Peribere, CEO, Sealed Air&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Going forward, more products made especially for India are likely to be launched. Already, more money is being allocated for R&amp;D at Sealed Air&rsquo;s India operations &mdash; Peribere says it could go up from roughly 10% to as much as 20-25% of global spend. &ldquo;We allocate $140 million each year to R&amp;D globally. Now, more funds will be allocated to this market,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Trained to succeed</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The second part of Sealed Air&rsquo;s India plan is to ensure its clients know just how to use its products &mdash; that&rsquo;s the best way to ensure they get results and, therefore, stay on as customers. Mohana M, managing editor of trade magazine <em>Clean India Journal</em>, points out that the institutional and industrial market for cleaning chemicals and equipment is very different from the retail market. &ldquo;A food processing industry or a pharma production unit cannot use a general purpose cleaning agent. It requires specific cleaning chemicals and equipment to attain the stipulated hygiene levels. Hence, even though India is a traditional market, cleaning chemicals and equipment specific to the institutional and industrial sectors have a different consumption pattern.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We conduct workshops for our staff from time to time. If the products are not used properly, they could add to your operation costs" - Ranjit Paliath, vice-president, business operations, McDonald''s India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">With new and advanced machines and products, training has become even more important in this line of business. In the past few years, the company has established learning centres in Mumbai and Bengaluru, where it conducts customised training programmes for employees of client companies on new products and operating procedures, including floor care, health care, restroom care and building care. Frequent audits are also done at client sites to ensure the products are being used appropriately. &ldquo;We conduct workshops for our staff from time to time. If these products are not used properly, they could just keep on adding to your operation costs,&rdquo; agrees Ranjit Paliath, vice-president, business operations, McDonald&rsquo;s India. Convincing customers to use their products the right way, then, is a big hurdle for Sealed Air.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Challenges ahead</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">McDonald&rsquo;s has been a Diversey, and now Sealed Air, customer globally for several decades. In India, too, the fast food giant has been a customer since its launch. Paliath says that the cleaning products don&rsquo;t come cheap, although food security and safety are far bigger concerns than the price. &ldquo;The last thing we would want our customers to worry about is any disease or anything wrong with our food,&rdquo; he adds. Indeed, that&rsquo;s the biggest reason Sealed Air has been able to sign on so many clients from customer-facing retail businesses, especially those dealing with food. &ldquo;Since hygiene and food safety are non-negotiable in the food industry, one looks at optimising cost and productivity,&rdquo; agrees Seema Atreya, vice-president, supply chain, Haldiram&rsquo;s India, a Sealed Air customer for packaging as well as cleaning solutions.</p>\n<p class="p3">The challenge now is to convince smaller hotels, restaurants and offices in India to switch to professional cleaning solutions. Jain estimates the INL market is worth Rs 1,500 crore a year, growing at a healthy 8-10% annually. But nearly half of it operates at the low end of the market and currently, only 5% of Sealed Air&rsquo;s revenues come from this customer group. It is now looking at expanding its business to tier 2 and tier 3 cities, which constitute only 30% of its business in the INL segment but account for a major chunk of the revenue from the F&amp;B segment, since all the food and beverages plants are situated in industrial areas outside metros. Jain wants to change the ratio to 50:50 in the INL segment despite competition in the form of cheaper alternatives. &ldquo;Our competition is with the caustic soda and phenyl that small-scale businesses still use,&rdquo; Jain complains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Cleaning in full force - Graphics</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">For instance, at Rs 2,000-2,200 per 50 kg, caustic soda comes at less than half the price of Diversey&rsquo;s cleaning detergent and chemicals, which cost Rs 2,500-2,700 per 25 kg. How then will its high pricing find favour in smaller cities? &ldquo;There are price buyers and value buyers. We have products that might have higher unit cost than the competitor&rsquo;s product, but, in the end, our solution is going to make them more productive,&rdquo; says Peribere.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s a standard pitch for most MNCs coming to India with high-priced offerings. But apart from the business benefits that come from maintaining high standards of hygiene and cleanliness for, say, a hotel, professionally formulated cleaning products also score on cleaning quality and fabric safety. Diversey is banking on this aspect, along with its cleaning equipment that get the job done better and faster. &ldquo;If a company has to add 10% to its operations cost to gain a 25% return on productivity, it won&rsquo;t think twice before paying up,&rdquo; says Jain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;It is definitely a huge investment, but it is a one-time investment and&nbsp;people&nbsp;are ready to pay the price,&rdquo; says Sajid Ali, general manager, P&amp;L, Radiant Hospitality, which provides professional housekeeping and cleaning services across&nbsp;seven cities and uses Taski machines&nbsp;at several sites (including malls)&nbsp;that it manages. &ldquo;Thanks to their efficient products and after-sales services such as regular&nbsp;maintenance&nbsp;audits,&nbsp;prompt customer feedback response&nbsp;and machine repairs, they can demand whatever price they want,&rdquo; Ali adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">That proposition may not be enough, though, to crack open a diverse and fragmented Indian market that often values upfront gains over long-term savings. So, while it sells to large customers directly, Sealed Air uses its network of over 400 distributors across the country to service small-scale clients. The number will increase, says Jain, as the business grows. The company currently has four warehouses in Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata, which cater to the nearest tier-2 or tier-3 cities. &ldquo;But the customer today wants quicker delivery,&rdquo; says Jain, and hence, the company is working at improving efficiency at its existing warehouses as well as opening them in more distant locations, such as Guwahati.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It also works closely with laundry centres and building service contractors, who help reach its products even further down the user chain. &ldquo;This way, we are just changing our client mix, but ultimately the product reaches the end customer,&rdquo; explains Jain. Sealed Air is also trying out new options such as allowing customers to pay in installments for high-end products such as the DF1 laundry dosing machine (#7-8 lakh), and offering smaller SKUs of its cleaning solutions to encourage trials.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Where its cleaning solutions usually come in 25 kg packs (5 kg in some cases), it will now also sell much smaller, 50 and 100 ml versions priced at Rs 10-20. This one-day quantity, the company hopes, will help it reach further down the client chain. It remains to be seen how successful this strategy will be. Some 4 km down the road from Sofitel, Prakash Shetty runs Nityanand Restaurant and has not even heard of Diversey, Sealed Air or its products. &ldquo;We use Sunny phenyl to wash floors and Wheel for dishes,&rdquo; he says dismissively. Shetty, who is a regular attendee of the monthly meetings of the Indian Hotels and Restaurants Association, says if the company has to mark its presence across the country, &ldquo;just saying that its products are better but costly, is not enough.&rdquo; His solution: &ldquo;Sealed Air needs to reconsider prices and work on its marketing strategies to reach us.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>', 'Packaging major Sealed Air wants a larger share of the institutional cleaning market after its Diversy buyout.

Nearly 80% is cornered by only two players &mdash; United Breweries with a 52.5% share and SABMiller with 27% &mdash; and Carlsberg&rsquo;s top brass is only too aware of the <br /> task on hand.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Carlsberg has a 7% share (not including Tamil Nadu since the state regulates that the manufacturer must have a brewery there in order to sell its beer) of the total beer sold in India and is targeting 10% over the next two years. To achieve that, it will quite simply need more people to say cheers to Carlsberg and its brands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>The Indian terrain</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">When Lauridsen moved to India in early 2010 after stints with Carlsberg in Poland and Laos, it was clear to him that there was something remarkably different about this market. &ldquo;Around 75% of the Indian beer market was tilted towards the strong beer segment. Today, it is getting closer to 90%,&rdquo; says Lauridsen, who spent over a decade with Unilever&rsquo;s foods business before joining Carlsberg in 2005. Globally, 90% of the market is mild beer with an alcohol content of less than 5%. In India, it&rsquo;s the other way round.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Size of the beer market - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Lauridsen was acutely aware of what needed to be done. In barely three months, he launched Tuborg Strong. It was not as if Carlsberg, a brand that traces its origins to Den mark, did not have a strong beer brand in India. It introduced Palone in Himachal Pradesh in June 2007 just after entering the Indian market and relaunched it as Palone 8 in January 2011. &ldquo;Palone was in a highly price-competitive end of the market, where the margins were low,&rdquo; says Lauridsen.</p>\n<p class="p3">What was interesting was that while Tuborg was already a significant brand in Carlsberg&rsquo;s portfolio, it never had a strong variant. &ldquo;I guess my bosses were a little surprised when I said we needed that in India,&rdquo; he recalls. That decision seems to have paid off with Tuborg Strong now accounting for 4.5% of Carlsberg&rsquo;s 7% market share, nearly two-thirds of its sales. Where Tuborg succeeded was in opening up a new segment, which was also at a premium price. &ldquo;This category didn&rsquo;t exist and we thought consumers would pay for quality,&rdquo; says Lauridsen. It was backed, of course, by some serious marketing &mdash; associating with the UEFA Cup football and different music events.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Big game hunting- Graphics</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Strong beers like Haywards and Kingfisher Strong had been around for a while, but there was nothing in the premium strong beer category. It had something to do with the perception that consumers would not pay a premium price for strong beer. In comparison, Tuborg Strong came with its unique pull-off cap, which made the can opener superfluous. Lauridsen thinks the preference for strong beer in India comes from the fact that there is a huge consumption of whisky and rum. &ldquo;Indians are probably used to that taste. If whisky needs to be sacrificed, some compensation is required,&rdquo; he says with a laugh.</p>\n<p class="p3">Rajiv Rao, national creative director, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, the agency that handles the Foster&rsquo;s beer account, says the biggest difference between a western beer drinking occasion and an Indian one is that the latter is primarily an all-male activity. More women drink it globally than in India, though no numbers are available. b also adds that an international lineage does not guarantee success in India. &ldquo;For the average Indian beer drinker, &ldquo;international beer&rdquo; has become tablestake (a minimum entry requirement).&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"When it coms to beer, an international lineage doesn''t guarantee success in India" - Rajiv Rao, national creative director, Ogilvy &amp; Mather</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">A year after bringing in Tuborg Strong, the company launched Carlsberg Elephant, a super-premium strong beer, at an expensive Rs 100-125 for a 650 ml bottle (Budweiser Magnum is the most expensive strong beer; launched in June 2012 at Rs 150, now selling in Maharashtra for Rs 175). The success of Tuborg Strong was a trigger and it is estimated that the brand has been growing by 100% each year (In the first six months, Tuborg sold a million cases &mdash; one case is approximately 12 bottles of 650 ml each. According to Lauridsen, Carlsberg grew by 37% in 2012. In the same period, Carlsberg Elephant grew by 128%, Tuborg Green (mild) grew by 66%, while Tuborg Strong, the biggest brand for the company, grew by 100%. The Tuborg brand in all &mdash; mild plus strong &mdash; sold over 10 million cases in 2012).</p>\n<p class="p3">Carlsberg Elephant earlier existed only in Germany and Denmark. &ldquo;Today, we sell more of that in India than either of the two countries,&rdquo; says Lauridsen. If there was a slight hesitation about entering the super-premium segment, he backed it up with the gut feeling that consumers will pay more for quality. &ldquo;It was easier to convince my bosses the second time,&rdquo; he says with a grin.</p>\n<p class="p3">Today, the strong beer segment in India is intensively competitive, with brands like Kingfisher Strong, Knock Out and Haywards 5000 from SABMiller, and Budweiser Magnum. They are all banking on the 15% growth rate that this space has been registering. In the process, the mild beer segment has taken a serious beating. Lauridsen allows himself a faint smile when asked about Carlsberg&rsquo;s milder version not really making an impact. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d obviously like it to sell a lot more but this is really a very different market. We have to just adapt,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Of course, the big reason to be in India is the low per capita beer consumption &mdash; 2 litres as against China&rsquo;s 39 litres &mdash; and the fact that Carlsberg&rsquo;s key markets globally are not exactly in growth mode. In 2012, Carlsberg&rsquo;s western Europe business grew by just 1%, while eastern Europe dropped by 6%. In contrast, Asia, on an organic basis alone, grew by 9% and with acquisitions &mdash; Carlsberg increased its ownership in breweries in Vietnam and Laos in addition to a JV in China &mdash; was up by 19%. Carlsberg&rsquo;s Indian operations grew by 45% the same year, and for the first time, volumes here exceeded 1 million hectolitres (100 litres make a hectolitre). Business in China, where Carlsberg sells 14 million hectolitres, grew by 4%. For the $11.82 billion Carlsberg group, Asia alone brought in 21% revenues for 2012; western Europe is the largest market, bringing in almost 42%. It is estimated that Carlsberg India has a topline of about Rs 350 crore. (SABMiller India had a topline of Rs 2,987 crore in FY12, as compared to Rs 2,487 crore in FY11).</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>A heady brew</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">If Carlsberg&nbsp; chose to enter the beer market through the buyout of a brewery in Himachal Pradesh, it was not without reason. There was no brand to be bought out, unlike other Asian markets like Cambodia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Nepal, where it either entered into a JV with a local player or just bought out existing local brands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Lauridsen admits that the entry into India should have taken place earlier. &ldquo;Since we came late, there was no business to acquire,&rdquo; he says. The big development, of course, was the global buyout of Foster&rsquo;s by SABMiller in 2006, which was preceded by the latter&rsquo;s acquisition of Shaw Wallace in 2005. The Shaw Wallace deal brought brands like Castle Lager, Haywards 5000 and Knock Out, and 10 breweries to the table. According to Pradeep Gidwani, who headed Foster&rsquo;s India for six years before setting up Carlsberg&rsquo;s Indian operations, Carlsberg&rsquo;s growth will depend significantly on where its breweries are located. &ldquo;In other parts of the world, it is not unusual to have one state-of-the-art brewery which can cater to the needs of the entire country. In India, it is a lot more complex since issues related to land and licenses vary state by state,&rdquo; he points out.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;In the early days, Carlsberg would serve the Andhra Pradesh market by bringing in the beer from neighbouring Maharashtra. &ldquo;It was an expensive affair till Andhra got its own brewery. Success in the beer market in India depends on a clear, long-term strategy and how deep your pockets are,&rdquo; says Gidwani. Today, Carlsberg has six breweries across Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Haryana. Work is underway on the ones in Haryana, a recent buyout where modernisation is taking place, and a greenfield project in Bihar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Success in the Indian beer market depends on how deep your pockets are" - Pradeep Gidwani, Ex-MD, Carlsberg India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In a country where the total beer market is at approximately 21 million hectolitres, the importance of having a brewery close to the market can&rsquo;t be exaggerated. Carlsberg&rsquo;s existing installed capacity across six breweries at this stage is 2.5 million hectolitres, with Bihar scheduled to add 0.5 million hectolitres a year from now. It is estimated that Carlsberg spends about Rs 100 crore on a new brewery; an Indian beer company would spend barely half that number. Lauridsen attributes that to conforming to the parent company&rsquo;s standards of quality and taste.</p>\n<p class="p3">Inevitably, this has a bearing on the margins as well, with very few players clocking net margins in excess of 5%. Lauridsen calls India his toughest beer assignment, for a variety of reasons. &ldquo;Every state has the autonomy to decide excise duties and taxes. It&rsquo;s not an easy market to make money in,&rdquo; he says. Some of that effort has been worth it since Carlsberg, he claims, has over a 20% market share in Delhi, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh and about 15% in Haryana.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Today, Carlsberg&rsquo;s brands are available in 23,000 retail outlets and over 15,000 hotels, restaurants and bars. But dealers like Randip Singh Munjral, owner of Shah &amp; Co, one of Mumbai&rsquo;s largest liquor outlets, are unhappy about the company&rsquo;s distribution services. &ldquo;The firm&rsquo;s sales team meets us once a month, while the person from Kingfisher comes four times a month. That is why it is not always easy (for consumers) to buy Carlsberg off the shelf,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s odd considering that retailers enjoy high margins on Carlsberg&rsquo;s brands, Munjral points out. &ldquo;Margins on the Kingfisher brands is 4-5%, Carlsberg mild gives us 8-9% and its strong beers 12%; on Foster&rsquo;s and Budweiser we make around 8%. It is a peculiar situation where margins are great but there isn&rsquo;t enough stock,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But Lauridsen is pretty ambitious about the five-year horizon. He is looking at a 15% market share, which will be backed by one or two more breweries. &ldquo;We could launch a couple of more brands. (But) brands cost money and we would rather spend that on our existing portfolio,&rdquo; he explains. In June, Carlsberg launched the first fruit-flavoured strong beer in Mumbai and Kolkata, with plans to take it across other states. Priced at Rs 105 for a 500 ml can and Rs 135 for a 650 ml bottle, Tuborg Booster Strong is testimony to how seriously Carlsberg is taking its position in the strong beer segment. Carlsberg India will need many more such stories to remain relevant in future. &nbsp;</p>', 'Organic growth powered by its superstrong beer has helped Danish brewer, Carlsberg, capture a chunk of the Indian market', '7', '', 0, '', 'a-heady-brew-351', 345, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'A heady brew', 'Organic growth powered by its superstrong beer has helped Danish brewer, Carlsberg, capture a chunk of the Indian market', '', '', '', 'Carlsberg,beer,Tuborg Strong', 0, NULL, '2015-01-31 12:57:26', '2015-01-31 14:11:48', '2013-07-20', 0),

Well-known private investor, Shivanand Mankekar, too, holds close to 5% in the company. Analysts are bullish about the company&rsquo;s prospects and expect MT Educare to compound sales at 26% and profits of 29% respectively over FY13-FY15.

(353, 20, '', 'Precious no more', '<p class="p1">What began as a gentle nudge by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has ended in a push that has taken the sheen off jewellery stocks. A rising current account deficit and a weak currency, led largely by rising crude and gold imports, prompted the RBI to urge banks to desist from pushing sales of gold coins and bars. But even as the surge continued &mdash; 162 tonne of gold imports in May &mdash; the RBI was forced to tighten the screws by making it mandatory for jewellers to import gold, either through banks, nominated agencies or directly, but with 100% margin. In other words: no credit from suppliers or bullion banks. Then, for the second time in six months, the government increased import duty on gold from 6% to 8%.</p>\n<p class="p3">While it&rsquo;s still early to see if the measures help in containing the deficit, the Street has been quick to react. Jewellery stocks have tanked in the past one month, some touching 52-week lows. Gitanjali Gems declined the most, by 59%, from May 31 to June 29. Similarly, PC Jeweller (18%), Shree Ganesh Jewellery House (20%), Titan Industries (23%) and Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri (25%), too, came under selling pressure.</p>\n<p class="p3">Analysts fear the worst as a clampdown on gold consumption impacts topline growth, while weak currency and credit curbs increase working capital requirements. According to Vikas Inder Jain, assistant vice-president, retail research, Religare Securities, &ldquo;Higher working capital requirements will push up debt equity ratios by 0.5-0.8%.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The All India Gems &amp; Jewellery Trade Federation has pointed out that jewellers will now have to pay more as bankers have started charging around $6-7 per ounce for leased gold against the earlier $1.5-2. Since most jewellery players lease gold from banks, their ability to pass on the higher cost to consumers is in question. Though players like Titan Industries have moved away from lease and have started importing gold directly, this could weigh on return ratios.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There are concerns that newly-listed players such PC Jeweller could go slow on their expansion, though the management has stated that it will open 14 stores this fiscal. The worst hit has been Gitanjali Gems, whose stock has come under severe selling from financiers, with whom the stock was pledged as collateral. Promoter Mehul Choksi has pledged around 15 million shares. Based on FY13 earnings per share, the stock is now quoting at a trailing 12-month multiple of just below 10.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Not surprisingly, analysts feel the rich multiple (35 times) enjoyed by jewellery stocks in the past will soon be history. Gautam Duggad, analyst at Motilal Oswal, feels much of the correction is already done. But, if the RBI decides to link gold lease rate to banks&rsquo; base rate, a fresh round of selling could well be in the offing.&nbsp;</p>', 'Weak demand and rising working capital needs take the shine out of jewellery stocks', '22', '', 0, '', 'precious-no-more-353', 347, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Precious no more', 'Weak demand and rising working capital needs take the shine out of jewellery stocks', '', '', '', 'RBI,Weak rupee,Current account deficit,Gold imports,Gitanjali Gems', 0, NULL, '2015-01-31 14:44:43', '2015-01-31 14:54:39', '2013-07-20', 0),
(354, 20, '', 'Build, and they will come', '<p class="p1">Vikram Sharma, a freshly minted civil engineer, was barely 24 when he entered the family business, Supreme Asphalts, in 1998. Asphalt is used in road construction and the company started by his father Bhawanishankar Sharma subsisted on supplies made to civil contractors. A few years later in 2002 when it reached revenues of Rs 20 crore, the company was renamed Supreme Infrastructure to reflect its growing ambitions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Supreme started off as an EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contractor in the roads business before moving to constructing bridges, then buildings and eventually into untested areas such as water, power and railways. Until it listed itself in&nbsp;October 2007, Supreme&rsquo;s revenue was entirely driven by EPC contracts that it bagged for road construction. It then decided to up the ante by bidding for built-operate-transfer (BOT) projects on its own. The chasm between an EPC contractor and a BOT operator is wide. Not only do you need much deeper pockets to bid and deliver on time, there is tremendous bureaucracy to navigate. Sharma, who is now managing director, explains, &ldquo;In 2009, BOT was the flavour of most large road projects. Getting into that segment was a strategicdecision, keeping in mind our&nbsp;execution capabilities.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Like most other infrastructure players, Supreme&rsquo;s growth has come on the back of government contracts. And that dependence continues even now. Government-backed orders comprised 76% of the FY13 order-book of Rs 6,044 crore. Within the order-book, EPC contracts for road, bridges and buildings dominate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Present tense</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">It is not a great time to be running an infrastructure business. Not only are new projects hard to come by, most companies in the sector have loaded their balance sheets with debt. Goutham Reddy, executive director at the Hyderabad-based Ramky Group, says it has been the worst phase in at least a decade. &ldquo;Even during the global financial crisis, there was liquidity in the market. The lack of it today is a big concern,&rdquo; he says. This drying up of investor interest has led to its own set of problems. &ldquo;Most of them had large equity components for their BOT projects in anticipation of money coming from private equity players. That has not materialised,&rdquo; adds Reddy. If that was not bad enough, over the past five years, the cost of debt has moved up sharply from 8% to 12%. Reddy sums up the situation as one where equity is being substituted by debt with the latter getting to be a very expensive proposition.</p>\n<p class="p3">Supreme is no exception. Consolidated debt has increased from Rs 991 crore in FY12 to Rs 1,439 crore in FY13. Sharma, however, believes his company willgradually repay the term loans obtained for funding the equity portion of BOT projects. His confidence emanates from the BOT projects that the company is executing and which when complete will throw off cash flows that will help in debt reduction. The company has a portfolio of 10 BOT projects, of which four are operational and the rest expected to start tolling by end-FY15.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Sharma elaborates, &ldquo;Part of the term loans obtained has been used for funding BOT projects. To address the high debt we are looking at securitising existing operational BOT projects. The securitisation of the Manor Wada &amp; Patiala-Nabha-Malerkotla project could happen in the next two to three quarters. We are looking at private equity funds, REIT fund, business trusts, etc., to fund the balance equity requirement of BOT projects and reduce debt at the parent level.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Amit Anwani of KC Securities, one of the few analysts tracking Supreme Infra, thinks the debt level in FY14 may remain flat or at the most increase slightly. Though he has a <em>buy</em> rating on the stock, he is worried about the tendering and execution delay across the road and construction industry. He says, &ldquo;The risk of project delays/ clearance delays cannot be ignored. Also, L1 [the lowest bid price] tenders are always proxy till they are confirmed; however, considering Supreme&rsquo;s FY13 order inflow, its order flow in FY14 could be moderate.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Business as usual</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">This fear of delay owing to the impending general election is playing on almost every analyst&rsquo;s mind, but Sharma considers it a temporary hiccup. &ldquo;Our current order-book covers our growth strategy for the next two years. Since we are working in 11 states, we have low dependence on any single state government or the central government. For existing BOT projects we have all clearances and sanctions required to achieve the commercial operations date.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">He also allays fears about delayed execution at Supreme&rsquo;s Jaipur Ring Road BOT project. &ldquo;There have been some delays due to land acquisition issues, but the project has now started and made significant progress. We expect to finish it before the scheduled timeline.&rdquo; That might just be true but what is equally evident is a rise in receivables. Government contracts where the payments would come in 80-90 days are now getting stretched to 120-130 days. On his part, Sharma believes that the growth in Supreme&rsquo;s FY13 receivables is in line with growth in turnover and also in line with the industry trend.</p>\n<p class="p3">The current order-book also has an unexecuted EPC component of #1,546 crore that belong to Supreme&rsquo;s own BOT projects. While the company does maintain that in-house EPC execution takes care of execution risk, how does it ensure that it gets the best possible price? &ldquo;We give a small portion of the EPC contract to a third party and based on that pricing, decide on an arm&rsquo;s length pricing for Supreme Infra as an EPC contractor. Due to our backward linkage, we are as competitive if not better than other EPC contractors.&rdquo; In the future, Supreme plans to grow both the EPC and BOT business as separate entities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Bulging book - Graphics</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">After his last experience, it might have dawned on Sharma that PE funds and most market financiers are fair weather friends. So, even if Supreme is eager to sell a stake in its BOT projects, given general market conditions, it might have to offer either a very sweet deal or hold back till the environment improves. Supreme did sell a 49% stake in Supreme Infrastructure BOT Holdings to 3i Capital for Rs 306 crore. While infusion of Rs 200 crore did happen, the events that unfolded later at 3i India have put the remaining Rs 106 crore in jeopardy. Given the not-so-favourable view of the UK principals about India, Supreme might have to fend for the cash itself. Sharma says he is more than ready for it. &ldquo;Our total equity requirement for BOT projects is about Rs 175 crore over the next two years (including #106 crore that was expected from 3i). Only four of our projects will need this funding; the rest are fully funded.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Watch this space</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">A weak economy could affect its projected toll revenues, as many other BOT road developers are realising to their peril. Here, too, Sharma says that actual inflows from projects under operations have been up to expectations so far and can only get better. &ldquo;Our internal collection estimate once all our BOT projects are operational in 2016, is around Rs 500 crore a year, which comes to about Rs 1.3-1.4 crore a day.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Supreme may have bid for the right BOT projects but none of it is getting reflected in the stock price. One reason could be the prevailing investor mood for infrastructure stocks, the other could be that investors believe that its earlier sparkling numbers cannot be maintained going forward. Supreme&rsquo;s current market cap of Rs 330 crore is overshadowed by its long term borrowing of Rs 1,439 crore and short-term borrowings of Rs 1,559 crore. As an additional surety, the promoters have pledged one-third of their holding. Though Sharma reiterates that pledged shares are only an additional security, he has been propping up his holding through market purchases.</p>\n<p class="p3">After touching a high of about Rs 350 in April 2012, the stock now trades at Rs 196. Trading volume has dried up considerably and average volume on the NSE has dropped from 25,000 for January to March to about 6,000 shares for April to June. The average volume in the April to June quarter last year was around 16,000 shares. On the BSE it is even more abysmal: there have been days when less than 500 shares have been traded.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The saving grace for shareholders who subscribed to the initial public offering (IPO) is that the current price of Rs 196 is above the IPO price of Rs 108 in October 2007 and the compounded return comes to 11% over a period of about six years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">For now, investors face the double whammy of an out-of-favour sector and an illiquid counter.

(357, 24, '', 'A weak brew', '<p class="p1">In a sense, <em>The Starbucks Experience</em>, first published in 2006, isn&rsquo;t really contemporary, with the world and the firm having gone through one of the most severe economic cycles after it came out. But the strong customer loyalty this brand commands in the US, coupled with its recent India foray, is what made me pick this book up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Its author, Joseph Michelli, is an organisational psychologist who had unfettered access over 18 months to the Starbucks ecosystem, and the book has the blessings of the company. It isn&rsquo;t surprising then that it manages to capture the core essence of the Starbucks philosophy and how it has grown to a 20,000+ store, highly profitable franchise across 62 countries. In many parts, it does feel adulatory &mdash; all signs of being an insider&rsquo;s book that you would find stacked along with the company&rsquo;s in-store merchandise.</p>\n<p class="p3">For those looking to understand Starbucks&rsquo; phenomenal rise, the book captures five key principles that the author has classified as the &ldquo;secret sauces&rdquo; for its success &mdash; 1) make it your own, 2) everything matters, 3) surprise and delight, 4) embrace resistance, and 5) leave your mark. Each of these sections has been peppered with anecdotes on how the author witnessed them in action or heard stories from customers and staff.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">What I found interesting was that Starbucks didn&rsquo;t cut corners even on &ldquo;below the deck&rdquo; items. The story of the corrugated sleeve cup holder is the result of one such effort to reduce paper consumption. It took two years to come up with a takeaway cup that didn&rsquo;t require &ldquo;nesting&rdquo; (using two cups so that you can hold a hot cup). The simple, yet elegant, temporary solution to use corrugated sleeves has now been adopted as a standard practice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It is evident that Starbucks, like any great business, spends tons of time and money in training its staff to delight and surprise customers. However, I found some of the stories completely blown out of proportion. Offering free samples or free replacements to customers is <em>de rigueur</em>; it happens all the time in the retail business.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In a nutshell, while the attempt to articulate the key reasons (5 principles) for Starbucks&rsquo; phenomenal success is laudatory, I did not end up any wiser on how it has managed to institutionalise this approach. Random stories on partner and customer behaviour appear too good to be true. I would have learnt far more from the book if the author had focused on the trials and tribulations that Starbucks faced in its journey to becoming one of the most respected companies, globally. What has made this business wildly successful? Why, for instance, has a competing chain not been able to replicate this success? I did not come across a single a-ha moment during the course of reading this book.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Insights</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p4"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Betting on themselves</strong></span></p>\n<p class="p1">Researchers <strong>Paul Brockman, Xu Li</strong> and <strong>S McKay Price</strong> set out to analyse the relation between the tone of company executives during conference calls and their subsequent insider trading behaviour in this particular study. But instead of finding a direct correlation between the two, which would mean the executives were putting their money where their mouths were, the researchers found positive conference call tones were followed by net insider selling and negative conference call tones made for net insider buying. The conclusion: Some top managers deliberately manipulate the tone of their concalls and mislead investors to give themselves and edge, although, the authors point out, ''it is always difficult to ascertain actual intentions''.

While many of us might leap at the chance to visit Japan on work, it doesn&rsquo;t hold the same appeal as a holiday destination. Do I know it has a vibrant nightlife? Given the popularity of its karaoke bars, I shudder &mdash; I&rsquo;m not up to spending my evenings in alcohol-soused lounges where badly sung international favourites pass for music. In any case, the touchstone for a family vacation must include, besides the obligatory sightseeing, exciting dining options and even greater shopping opportunities. Tokyo might have passed that test in the 1970s &mdash; think Panasonic two-in-ones &mdash; and may have been responsible for most Western fashion and cosmetic brands to test the Asian luxury market, but even my diplomatic friend has to admit that finding a fit for clothes and shoes for Indian bodies in Japan can pose a problem, and as for bags and stuff, have you ever heard anyone ask&nbsp;for a Ferragamo, or Birkin, from Tokyo or Osaka?</p>\n<p class="p3">But Asia&rsquo;s East, popular with outbound Indians with rupees to burn, does offer diverse shopping attractions. The trouble is that despite the variety and attractive prices, Bangkok is getting jaded. Its famed night markets, so much fun the first couple of times, get boring after a few visits &mdash; how many jute or woven bags with wooden handles can you carry back as gifts? Besides, Mumbai and Delhi are flooded with Bangkok variants of everything from furniture to flip-flops to clothes that fit better than those in Bangkok where the availability of generous sized clothes (the plus-plus that is still demoralisingly small for many Indian women) takes a bit of finding.</p>\n<p class="p3">In Korea, I&rsquo;ve found the clothes a better fit, but they require you to try them out since a &ldquo;medium&rdquo; in Seoul might be an &ldquo;extra large&rdquo; in Bangkok, a &ldquo;large&rdquo; in Singapore, and a &ldquo;small&rdquo; in Hong Kong. And given the language problems there, it&rsquo;s traumatic asking where the changing rooms are, and though it&rsquo;s a technology paradise, you&rsquo;d better be sure of your requirements else you could end up with quite different merchandise from what you had imagined in the sealed packages.</p>\n<p class="p3">For my money, the best shopping &mdash; and I&rsquo;m not including China here &mdash; is to be found in Singapore and Hong Kong, but where Singapore is expensive, Hong Kong is more affordable for the same brands. Singapore resembles a giant shopping mall and, like Hong Kong, is strongly driven by Western brands, and has a bewildering range on offer within the Orchard Road vicinity alone &mdash; from electronics to fashion, make-up and accessories &mdash; and given the strong Indian presence as both residents and tourists, you can count on your size being more easily available there.</p>\n<p class="p3">The expat population of Hong Kong too guarantees that &mdash; and how. Till a few years ago, it was still possible to pick up quaint Chinese artefacts, porcelain articles and so on from Hong Kong, but less so now beyond the obligatory &ldquo;touristy&rdquo; nod to such objects. Hong Kong is where shopping is the most convenient in the East, since the sizes match closest to those back home, and the fits could almost be customised, they&rsquo;re so good. Mostly, though, this is a smart clothes paradise, and if you&rsquo;re a brand junkie, Hong Kong is the place to go shopping, its visa on arrival facility making <br /> it convenient too.</p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If anything, Macau, an hour&rsquo;s ferry ride from Hong Kong airport, is even better, with the shopping centralised in a manner that allows one to walk seamlessly from one hotel&rsquo;s shopping mall to another (with wayside distractions like the casinos). Great for clothes, it&rsquo;s fantastic too for watches, jewellery (especially diamonds), children&rsquo;s toys (with a huge Toys&ldquo;R&rdquo;Us outlet), and duty free stores with an eye-popping range that could make airport shopping almost redundant &mdash; especially with regard to make-up and perfumes. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if the Ladies-Who-Shop groups that head for Bangkok twice a year want to switch henceforth to Macau. </span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>&mdash;The author is a Delhi-based&nbsp;writer and curator</strong></p>', 'The shopping experience across the near and far east is as varied as it is surprising', '17', '', 0, '', 'eastern-splurge-358', 352, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Eastern splurge', 'The shopping experience across the near and far east is as varied as it is surprising', '', '', '', 'Shopping,East Asia,Tokyo,Bangkok,Singapore,Hong Kong,Macau', 0, NULL, '2015-01-31 15:44:41', '2015-01-31 15:54:22', '2013-07-20', 0),

(361, 12, '', 'When wishes come true', '<p class="p1">A 1965 American fantasy sitcom seems more likely to inspire giggles and groans, not business ideas. But that&rsquo;s how it worked out for Akhilesh Pandya. Growing up in the early days of cable TV in India, Pandya was hooked to <em>I Dream of Jeannie</em>, where a 2,000-year-old genie appears out of a bottle to magically perform difficult tasks in &mdash; literally &mdash; the blink of an eye. Finishing his homework and arranging his schedule to ensure he didn&rsquo;t miss a single episode was second nature to the young Pandya. So much so that when, a couple of decades later, he decided to turn entrepreneur, one of his first ideas centred on Jeannie. &ldquo;Jeannie would try to make her master&rsquo;s worries vanish. I wanted to offer something similar &mdash; an online version who will handle your tasks with care and take away worries,&rdquo; says the 37-year-old first-generation entrepreneur.</p>\n<p class="p3">The result was GenieOnCall, which started off in January 2012 as a virtual assistant but has quickly expanded to become a &ldquo;lifestyle management assistant&rdquo;, offering help in almost everything &mdash; from paying utility bills and organising birthday parties to making a presentation, software and web development to architecture and interior design. Nearly 18 months later, Pandya&rsquo;s start-up will close FY14 with a projected Rs 50 lakh in revenue, has close to 400 clients and is expanding out of its home base in Agra, to the National Capital Region (NCR).</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>The accidental entrepreneur</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Pandya&rsquo;s brush with business is pure happenstance. A native of Agra, he moved out of the city after graduating in economics. More than a decade later, he quit his job with OKS Group, a knowledge process outsourcing company, and returned to Agra when his mother took ill. Having handled the Dun &amp; Bradstreet account while at OKS, he continued his association with the information company by taking on consulting assignments across geographies. &ldquo;But I was travelling all the time, which defeated the purpose for which I had moved back,&rdquo; Pandya recalls. That&rsquo;s when the idea of working for himself struck. &ldquo;Everyone needs help some time or the other, but they don&rsquo;t always get it. Wouldn&rsquo;t a portal where all services are provided make life easier and help people get a lot more done?&rdquo; Pandya explains the rationale.</p>\n<p class="p3">With about Rs 4 lakh from his savings, Pandya set up GenieOnCall, investing in the website and IT infrastructure. There was no money left to pay salaries, so he didn&rsquo;t hire any staff, taking on assignments himself. Given his experience in the outsourcing and online world, the first service the company offered was a virtual assistant, providing administrative and technical support over the net &mdash; from internet research, replying to e-mail and taking messages, to providing assistance with travel arrangements, etc. &ldquo;There were many sleepless nights at the time because I had no help at all,&rdquo; he says now. &ldquo;I was targeting busy professionals, but the kind of customers that came in asked for so many different services.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>GenieOnCall- Element</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s because, he reasons, a virtual assistant isn&rsquo;t all that different from a flesh-and-blood one. &ldquo;Once you have a personal assistant, it&rsquo;s human nature to delegate all types of chores &mdash; official as well as personal. Similarly, with us, once that trust and rapport is built with the customer, they will see us as their one and only source of information and assistance.&rdquo; He cites examples to underline his theory. A customer who had signed on for a virtual assistant came back to ask for a website designer for his wife&rsquo;s business; another client wanted help with his accounts in addition to the virtual assistant. Then there&rsquo;s Ashok Subramanian, a neurolinguistic programming trainer who runs Shinota Consulting. One of GenieOnCall&rsquo;s earliest customers for virtual assistant services, Subramanian now outsources all his &ldquo;mundane work&rdquo; to the company, such as travel arrangements, accounting, calling up people for feedback and content writing for brochures. &ldquo;I have slowly done away with office staff &mdash; I work with Genie on a contract basis, paying Rs 30,000-40,000 a month, less than what I used to pay as salaries.&rdquo; He credits Pandya&rsquo;s team with being proactive in spotting opportunities for business promotion. &ldquo;They were the ones to suggest a social media presence and now manage it also for me,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Making the magic work</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">How does the GenieOnCall model work? Pandya now has a team of 35 &ldquo;genies&rdquo;, many of them holding degrees in management and engineering. Clients can choose either virtual assistant packages &mdash; which begin with 50 hours of assistance every month &mdash; or one-time assignments such as making a presentation, designing a website and so on. The typical turnaround time for most one-off services, such as finding a spa or making travel arrangements, is two or three hours, although some assignments, such as making a presentation, could take eight hours or more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Genie&rsquo;s charges also depend on the service requested &mdash; while a virtual assistant can come for between Rs 7,500 and Rs 20,000 a month, one-off assignments cost anywhere from Rs 1,500-1.2 lakh. As of now, one-time assignments don&rsquo;t include concierge services but involve more complex work such as web designing and research work, for which Genie charges Rs 150-200 per hour.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Virtual assistant services are popular in the West and are now picking up in India as well. GenieOnCall certainly has several competitors in this space. Brickwork India and Indian VA are among the earliest players in the business, having been around for a decade or so. There are also players such as Taskbarge, Flatworld Solutions, the TTK Group&rsquo;s GetFriday and Datacore Technologies, as well as smaller outfits such as bookmyva and OnDemandVA.</p>\n<p class="p3">What sets GenieOnCall apart, then? Simply, its bouquet of services includes anything that can be outsourced, whether in the corporate world or in personal life. &ldquo;We have a request from a Mumbai executive who has used our services in the past and wants an errand boy to buy her groceries. We&rsquo;re looking into that,&rdquo; says Pandya. Amit Nagar, a corporate executive, got in touch with GenieOnCall on a friend&rsquo;s recommendation. &ldquo;We have a new service support office in Bangladesh and Genie gave us contacts of vendors for setting up the office, communication lines, vendors for laptops, computers and even transport facilities.&rdquo; Nagar says his company now plans to use the firm&rsquo;s services at its other offices as well.</p>\n<p class="p3">The company&rsquo;s services portfolio has been ramped up in the past months to include accountancy, legal, customer management and HR services. The expansion that has Pandya the most excited is concierge services, where GenieOnCall offers to take over routine chores like paying bills, helping find doctors, plumbers, beauty salons and even astrologers. &ldquo;There is so much scope for this business, especially in the B2B space,&rdquo; Pandya says. GenieOnCall has already been providing such services to companies in the NCR, where Pandya says business has grown simply through word of mouth. Here&rsquo;s how it works: a GenieOnCall staffer visits the client&rsquo;s office every day at a set time and picks up all the odd jobs the client&rsquo;s employees want done, including utility bills, bank work and bureaucratic work. &ldquo;Our SLA [service level agreement or the contracted delivery time] is 48 hours, but 90% of the time, the work is completed a few hours after pick-up,&rdquo; says Pandya proudly.</p>\n<p class="p3">The Essel group&rsquo;s Noida campus, which has over 2,000 employees, has been a client for the past eight months. Ashutosh Mishra, vice-president, HR, Dish TV, believes the arrangement with Genie is working better than the previous concierge service hired by the group, since the start-up scores well on punctuality and dependability, two key requirements from such a service. &ldquo;Our people are mostly in their late 20s. Their requirements are mostly sending money back home, sending flowers or cakes, and paying mobile and credit card bills. Genie representatives are polite and helpful &mdash; even if they can&rsquo;t provide a service, they tell people how to get it done.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Branching out</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Accolades like these are prompting Pandya to look beyond Agra. He is already in the process of setting up Genie&rsquo;s first office outside the city, in Noida. He plans to soon open offices in all the metros, purely to deal with customer perception, as &ldquo;there is a mistaken belief that tier 2 cities won&rsquo;t be able to deliver world-class services.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Still, there are advantages to being in a small town, the biggest being lower costs. The dearth of employment opportunities also means Genie is able to pick up suitable employees relatively easily and at lower salaries. All of which helps the firm keep its rates competitive &mdash; Pandya claims that Genie&rsquo;s rates are among the lowest in the virtual assistant space. &ldquo;Most companies charge $6-60 per hour. Our pricing is much lower than the lowest pricing band of other service providers,&rdquo; says Pandya. &ldquo;We will also begin marketing from August onward, and so we expect our revenue to more than double this year.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">That is why, he says, private equity players have expressed interest in coming on board GenieOnCall. While nothing&rsquo;s been finalised yet, Pandya admits to being in talks with investors. He&rsquo;s currently making plans for expanding the scope of operations once funding is in. Genie is revamping its website and will soon launch a mobile application. &ldquo;We are investing in technology to make sure our systems are foolproof, so that the information we store remains confidential,&rdquo; he adds. This way, Pandya is ensuring that his clients are at ease outsourcing their worries.&nbsp;</p>', 'Akhilesh Pandya''s lifestyle management service wants to make your worries disappear', '30', '', 0, '', 'when-wishes-come-true-361', 355, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'When wishes come true', 'Akhilesh Pandya''s lifestyle management service wants to make your worries disappear', '', '', '', 'GenieOnCall,Lifestyle management assistant,Virtual assistance,Concierge services', 0, NULL, '2015-02-02 10:59:44', '2015-02-02 11:08:15', '2013-08-03', 0),
(362, 16, '', 'The great TAMasha', '<p class="p1">A&nbsp;lot can happen in a month, especially in the broadcast industry. In June, when broadcasters were withdrawing their subscriptions from TAM (Television Audience Measurement) Media Research &mdash; currently the only mechanism to assess television viewership in India &mdash; advertisers had its back, reiterating support and warning that abandoning the ratings system would be &ldquo;regressive&rdquo;. Fast forward to July, and the same advertisers are now slamming both, the ratings agency and broadcasters, for switching to a new ratings system. The time period of the new system? A month.</p>\n<p class="p3">What happened was that TAM appeased broadcasters who attacked its &ldquo;flawed&rdquo; measurement system &mdash; against 154 million TV viewing households, it has a sample size of just 9,000, which throws up incongruous results like a rating of zero for CNBC in Delhi in June. &ldquo;For GECs, viewership has dropped by 25-30% between January and June. That means people have stopped watching TV, which we completely disagree with,&rdquo; says Rohit Gupta, president (network sales), Multi Screen Media (<em>see: The last straw</em>).</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>The last straw - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Now, TAM has switched to monthly rather than weekly ratings for about nine networks, including Star India, Multi Screen Media, Viacom 18, TV18, Zee and NDTV. Other channels, meanwhile, will continue getting weekly ratings. Not having a uniform system across networks hasn&rsquo;t gone down well with the interested parties. Terming this system &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo;, CVL Srinivas, CEO, GroupM (South Asia), the world&rsquo;s largest media investment management group with clients such as Hindustan Unilever and Vodafone, says this will definitely hamper media planning, buying and pricing on television. &ldquo;It will cause a negative impact on television advertising spending. Advertisers have already&nbsp;started pulling out their ads due to the confusion,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">You don&rsquo;t have to look far for reasons why broadcasters want to switch to monthly ratings &mdash; they get averaged-out numbers and delayed results buy them time with advertisers. Not surprisingly, then, broadcasters don&rsquo;t think moving to monthly ratings is a cause for concern. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that people have gotten used to weekly ratings,&rdquo; says Markand Adhikari, vice-chairman and managing director, Shri Adhikari Brothers Television Network, which owns channels like Mastiii and Dhamaal and continues to be on the weekly system.</p>\n<p class="p3">As things stand, advertisers are the most directly affected party &mdash; the weekly ratings system has been in place for over 14 years and most media planning and buying happens on the basis of those numbers. What is particularly galling for most players is that internationally, the trend is for &ldquo;day-after&rdquo; ratings, which makes monthly ratings a giant step backward. Marquee advertisers have already made their displeasure evident &mdash; media reports say top advertisers like Hindustan Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble, Bharti Airtel and Colgate-Palmolive have threatened to stop all television advertising until the monthly ratings are once again replaced with weekly numbers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Another big advertiser, Havells India, is also considering other options. The company spends a sizeable Rs 130 crore on advertising each year, with at least half going on cricket. With monthly ratings, points out joint managing director, Anil Gupta, the company &ldquo;loses control over the efficiency of money we put on these channels; our reaction time will be slower&rdquo;. While cricket advertising may continue unchanged, Gupta points to the huge opportunities in digital and print advertising. &ldquo;We may cut our exposure to television and reduce our risk,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s a thought echoed by smaller advertisers, who stand to lose even more by punting on month-old ratings. &ldquo;We are already increasing our exposure to other media such as digital and outdoor,&rdquo; says Shekhar Agarwal, director, Surya Food, which manufactures the Priyagold biscuits brand. The company has an annual advertising budget of Rs 20 crore, 65% of which is traditionally spent on TV.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Advertisers are also pinning their hopes on the Broadcasting Audience Research Council (BARC), which is working on an alternative to TAM that should be ready sometime next year. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It is unlikely that advertisers will stay away from television for too long. Right now, it doesn&rsquo;t matter much &mdash; July to September are lean advertising months. But once the festive season begins, they are more than likely to return, if they leave in the first place, that is.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><span class="s2">&nbsp;</span></p>', 'The drama''s all off-screen as advertisers and broadcasters face off over a new monthly ratings system', '7', '', 0, '', 'the-great-tamasha-362', 356, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'The great TAMasha', 'The drama''s all off-screen as advertisers and broadcasters face off over a new monthly ratings system', '', '', '', 'TAM ratings,Media planning', 0, NULL, '2015-02-02 11:10:13', '2015-02-02 11:14:18', '2013-08-03', 0),
(363, 16, '', 'The baron of the box-office', '<p class="p1">Sunil Lulla is trying hard to stop smiling and eventually just gives up. His glee is understandable: two of the biggest Bollywood grossers of the year had his company&rsquo;s involvement. Even by the most conservative estimate, Lulla&rsquo;s investments in <em>Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani</em> and <em>Raanjhanaa</em> have more than doubled, though the executive vice-chairman and MD of Eros International Media does not readily share numbers. Where Eros made $11 million (over Rs 60 crore) on the overseas distribution of the Ranbir Kapoor film, <em>Raanjhanaa</em> was a surprise hit, earning its producer Rs 65 crore in domestic box-office collection and another Rs 15 crore from overseas ticket sales.</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>On a blockbuster run- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">For a business that&rsquo;s really less than a decade old, Eros has done pretty well for itself. It has a library of over 1,200 titles in Hindi, Tamil, Punjabi and Marathi and has interests spanning end-to-end distribution, co-production and acquisition. In FY13, the company released 77 films and an equal number in the preceding year. Over the past six years starting with FY08, Eros&rsquo; total income on a consolidated basis moved up from Rs 490 crore to Rs 1,074 crore, while net profit increased from Rs 42.73 crore to Rs 154.54 crore, making it one of the fastest growing companies in India. And Lulla and his team think this kind of growth can be sustained for a while to come. Here&rsquo;s how.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Advantage overseas</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Eros was started in 1977 by Lulla&rsquo;s father, Arjan Lulla, as a partnership firm. The family, most of whose members were in London, would acquire overseas rights of films from Indian producers and distribute them in markets outside India. Eros was incorporated in 1994 as Rishima International, which bought out the partnership firm a few years later. The Indian foray started only in 2005 when Eros co-produced <em>Waqt</em> with Vipul Shah. Since then, the company steadily moved from mere film distribution to becoming a content aggregator through a mix of acquisitions, co-productions and productions. This content is then distributed across various media and different geographies.</p>\n<p class="p3">None of which is really complicated or really unique, so what&rsquo;s the secret sauce that is helping Eros succeed in such a highly unpredictable market? The short answer: family ties. Eros has a cast-iron agreement with its parent, Eros International Plc, through which the British firm acquires the international film rights for every film co-produced, acquired or distributed by Eros International Media. According to group CFO Kamal Jain, this covers 30% of the cost of the film with a 30% mark-up. &ldquo;In all, this works out 39% of the cost recovered. There is no doubt this is a cushion for us,&rdquo; he admits.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s also a guaranteed source of about 25% of Eros&rsquo; annual income. Where other producers and distributors may struggle to find an overseas market for their films, either because of small budgets or inadequate network, Eros has the reassurance that any film it invests in &mdash; whether it is a hit or flop, and no matter the budget &mdash; will also find a market overseas because the British parent will buy it regardless. According to Rakesh Madhotra, CEO, Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment, his banner has always serious challenges when it comes to distributing films overseas, given a lack of expertise and connections. In the past few years, Nadiadwala Grandson has co-produced three hit film with Eros &mdash; <em>Kambakkht Ishq</em>, <em>Housefull</em> and <em>Housefull 2</em>. With Eros taking care of distribution, marketing and execution, &ldquo;our focus was restricted to being creative and we managed to minimise risks substantially. More importantly, they took care of opening up new markets for us,&rdquo; says Madhotra, adding that the company was &ldquo;pleasantly surprised&rdquo; by the movies&rsquo; showing in overseas markets.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"For most producers, India is still the largest market because it''s difficult to sell outside if you can''t catch the attention of the right people" - Boney Kapoor, producer</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Well-known producer Boney Kapoor concedes that a good network is critical for earning from overseas markets. &ldquo;For most producers, India is still the largest market because it is difficult to sell your film outside if you can&rsquo;t catch the attention of the right people, or you don&rsquo;t have a substantial budget.&rdquo; On the other hand, with the backing of a strong parent, even small films can make it big overseas. Vijay Singh, CEO, Fox Star Studios, points out that his film <em>My Name is Khan</em> brought in $24 million from the overseas market. And it&rsquo;s not just big-budget films. &ldquo;Even a film like <em>Jolly LLB</em> [produced and distributed by Fox Star] this year was released in 18 markets, which is unheard of for a small budget film without a top billing star. It did a business of #3.3 crore outside India,&rdquo; he says. In all, the film brought in Rs 31 crore on a budget of Rs 13.5 crore.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Even a film like <em>Jolly LLB</em> this year was released in 18 markets, which is unheard of for a small budget film" - Vijay Singh, CEO, Fox Star Studio</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">For Eros, the guaranteed overseas rights sale is critical not just as an income stream but also as part of its derisking strategy. In a year, the company has about 75 film releases and in all, it sells the music and satellite rights two to three weeks before release &mdash; by doing this, even a film that proves a lemon at ticket sales could still be profitable for the company. Between overseas distribution, satellite and music rights, Eros usually manages to recover as much as 60-80% of the cost even before the film makes it to the theatre.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Top grossers - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;I bet you thought we lost money on <em>Ra.One</em>,&rdquo; Lulla smiles mischievously. The SRK-starrer, in which Eros invested Rs 100 crore as co-producer, proved a damp squib on its Diwali 2011 release. Still, Eros wasn&rsquo;t in the red over the film &mdash; apart from Rs 65 crore from the box office, it earned #35 crore from satellite rights, Rs 12 crore from music sales and at least Rs 25 crore from overseas theatrical rights. And it owns the film&rsquo;s rights forever, so it can keep making money on future television rights, any sequels or spinoffs and online versions.&nbsp;As it happens, Eros&rsquo; derisking obsession isn&rsquo;t limited to distribution &mdash; and it spills over to sourcing content as well.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Go green</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Eros&rsquo; approach to sourcing content &mdash; building up the library, acquiring film rights and striking production and co-production deals &mdash; can be considered one of abundant caution. It&rsquo;s also been institutionalised within the company. A &ldquo;greenlight&rdquo; board comprising executives in India and overseas review each new project based on two criteria: creative and financial. Creative takes into consideration the track record of the producer and director, the script and star cast, whether the genre will click with the audience and the tentative release date. The financial analysis looks at the track record of the lead stars, their returns from earlier films, the possible return on investment and budget. CFO Jain says that after considering all this, the cost of the project, including promotion and advertising, should yield a return of at least 25%. Usually, we don&rsquo;t touch anything less than that,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Typically, in new acquisition projects, the company takes over distribution, satellite and all other global rights, while it rarely settles for less than 50% of all intellectual property rights in co-productions. Still, every film is considered on its own merits. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a complete buffet. We pick and choose what we want and only in rare cases will we eat everything,&rdquo; Jain says. &ldquo;This makes our model unique and devoid of irrational risks.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">About 70% of Eros&rsquo; movies are acquisitions, where the company buys out the rights to films for 15-20 years. Co-production deals account for about 20%, while the least preferred model, which accounts for the rest, is one where Eros is the producer. That&rsquo;s also the model where it has seen the most failures. Recent examples include <em>Desi Boyz</em> and <em>Aa Dekhen Zara</em>, both of which failed to strike it rich at the box-office. &ldquo;This is a tough model to scale up and that is why we have a limited number of films here,&rdquo; says Jain.</p>\n<p class="p3">The stringent selection process means only about one film in five that come to the table is shown the green light. While that does help separate the wheat from the chaff, sometimes blockbusters are given the go-by. Industry sources point out that Eros passed up films such as <span class="s1"><em>3 Idiots</em></span> based on its greenlight process. By and large, though, Eros has had a good track record. &ldquo;Over the last four years, we have had at least three films in the top 10 Bollywood grossers every year,&rdquo; says Lulla. In FY13, the winners were <em>Housefull 2</em>, <em>Son of Sardaar</em> and <em>Khiladi 786</em>; the previous year, it was <em>Ready</em>, <em>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</em> and <em>Ra.One</em>. &ldquo;Our USP is that we know how to monetise across platforms, be it television, DTH, iPTV or any form of new media. Our co-production model means we get a chance to work with every star,&rdquo; he adds. Going forward, though, it&rsquo;s looking beyond obvious routes to success.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Beyond the obvious</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">On April 1, 2012, the brass at Eros held a strategic meeting at the&nbsp; company headquarters in Mumbai. &ldquo;It was just to understand and get ideas from everyone on how to take the brand to the next level,&rdquo; recalls Jain. A long meeting and much brainstorming later, two key decisions were taken. The first was to look beyond Hindi. &ldquo;It was important to reduce our dependence on one market and we needed to step up as far as Tamil was concerned,&rdquo; he says. Eros already had a headstart in the Tamil film business, thanks to a 51:49 joint venture with Ayngaran, a company that distributed Tamil films in overseas markets; the 2007 deal also gave Eros access to Ayngaran&rsquo;s library of over 600 films. During Diwali 2012, two films where Eros acquired the distribution rights, <em>Thuppaki</em> and <em>Maatraan</em>, set the cash registers ringing and went on to be among the top three Tamil grossers of the year, convincing the company even more that investing in Tamil films was money well spent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Since the dynamics of the Tamil film industry are completely different, Eros had to tweak its approach here. Jain points out Tamil films depend heavily on theatrical revenue, with limited contribution from other avenues such as music and satellite rights, all of which are critical to Eros&rsquo; Bollywood model. A Tamil film&rsquo;s cast also plays a huge role in deciding its fate, and so Eros is entering into co-production agreements only for movies with big names such as Rajinikanth, Vijay and Surya. Later this year, Eros will co-produce and release the Rajinikanth-starrer, <em>Kochadaiyaan</em>, to be followed by <em>Rana</em>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s slightly hard to go wrong with Rajinikanth,&rdquo; Lulla says with a laugh. That&rsquo;s perhaps the biggest change from Eros&rsquo; Bollywood model since big names also mean big budgets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>A busy year ahead - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In fact, the second decision taken at the April 2012 meeting was completely contrary to this since it encouraged taking up non-star cast films and marketing them like big productions. &ldquo;There is a huge upside and a low downside. You could make as much as Rs 200 crore and the downside could be a much smaller Rs 20 crore,&rdquo; Jain explains. The rationale: In a non-star cast film, you lose very little if the film flops. For instance, if films like <em>Vicky Donor</em> and <em>Ferrari ki Sawaari</em> &mdash; which Eros co-produced and released in May 2012 &mdash; had bombed on their budgets of Rs 9 crore and Rs 10 crore (which included Rs 4-5 crore for advertising), respectively, the pain would have been far less compared with, say, what UTV underwent with <em>Himmatwala</em> (budget: Rs 72 crore). But if the films turned out to be hits &mdash; and both these films did make returns of three to seven times on budget &mdash; there is a huge windfall.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The big winner with this strategy was <em>English Vinglish</em>. Made on a total budget of Rs 27 crore, the movie made Rs 40 crore at the domestic box office and another Rs 24 crore outside India. And that&rsquo;s not even counting the Rs 15 crore made from the sale of home video, music and satellite rights. &ldquo;On an average, a film makes 20-25% of its collection from overseas markets. In the case of <em>English Vinglish</em>, it was 40%,&rdquo; says Lulla. That&rsquo;s because in addition to Hindi versions of the film, Eros also released versions dubbed in Japanese and German.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Neither of these strategies &mdash; focusing on regional cinema and low-budget films &mdash; is rocket science, so why aren&rsquo;t other film companies adopting similar methods to grow? Industry players point out that most producers and distributors are limited by their competencies &mdash; they may have access to overseas markets (which would give a boost to small-budget movies), or pockets deep enough to sign on big stars, or the network to negotiate the best pre-release deals for satellite and music rights, but it&rsquo;s unusual to find all these under one roof. &ldquo;Our model is not easy to replicate since most of the others are either just producers with a small overseas presence or people with a small library or people who just do a bit of everything,&rdquo; agrees Jain. Even big corporate players such as Fox Star, UTV and Reliance Entertainment lose out to Eros when it comes to library size &mdash; UTV, for instance, has just 120 films compared with 1,200 for Eros. Incidentally, that&rsquo;s another asset Eros plans on utilising to the hilt going forward.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>A new script</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The Lullas took their first step towards television in the late 1990s, when Eros Plc launched a Bollywood channel, b4u, beamed from London. While the channel has survived all these years, late last year, Eros deepened its TV connection by adding a new partner &mdash; it inked a deal with HBO Asia to launch HBO Defined and HBO Hits. The two bilingual ad-free movie channels were launched in February at a price tag of #100 per month. While HBO owner Time Warner, will bring in the English films that will make up 70% of the content, Eros will supply Hindi films (which make up the remaining 30%) from its own library, adding 10 new titles every year. &ldquo;This is an opportunity born out of digitisation. In the time to come, we will need to look at new ideas where our content can be offered on 4G and other broadband platforms,&rdquo; says Lulla.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Already, the company is considering new media as an important avenue of content distribution. Last March, Lulla launched Eros Now, an on-demand entertainment portal online that has 50,000 paying subscribers, while the Eros Now channel on YouTube is among the most-watched Indian channel on the website, with over 1 million subscribers. And in July 2012, Eros also signed a Rs 95-crore deal with general entertainment channel Colors for nine of its coming films to be shown on the channel over the next few years. There&rsquo;s a good reason for this off-screen activity. As Lulla points out, &ldquo;A film getting into the second week is a rarity these days. It&rsquo;s not an easy business to be in.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>', 'Eros International has derisked its business model with a focussed approach towards content creation and film distribution', '7', '', 0, '', 'the-baron-of-the-box-office-363', 357, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'The baron of the box-office', 'Eros International has derisked its business model with a focussed approach towards content creation and film distribution', '', '', '', 'Eros International,Sunil Lulla,Film distribution', 0, NULL, '2015-02-02 11:16:34', '2015-02-02 11:36:23', '2013-08-03', 0);

While the stock is up over 22.1% year-till-date, the Sensex is up only 5.7%. In fact, group entity Ajanta Mercantile has bought over 50,000 shares at Rs 679 a share, thus increasing its stake marginally from 10.97% to 10.98%. The promoters currently hold over 61% stake and have not pledged any shares. Analysts continue to be bullish on the stock, after the initial period of scepticism over the acquisition and performance of Havells&rsquo; European subsidiary, Sylvania, which resulted in Havells posting a loss of Rs 160 crore in FY09. But since then revenues have shown a CAGR of 5% from Rs 5,477 crore to Rs 7,248 crore in FY13, while profits have been robust, clocking Rs 581 crore in FY13. More importantly, Sylvania has managed to generate higher profitability with profit after tax more than doubling to &euro;31 million in FY13 over the previous year. Not surprisingly, analysts and investors are keeping the faith in the stock and expect earnings to grow 15-20% for FY14.

The consensus: Sensex companies will see an earnings growth of 19% in FY14 compared with 7% during the last financial year. However, like any composite score, this 19% earnings growth has a wart and that, in this case, is one of back-ended growth.</p>\n<p class="p3">Indian companies hit a rough growth patch post the 2008 global credit crisis and since then are yet to find their mojo. The first quarter of FY14 is likely to mirror the persistently weak sales growth over the last few quarters. For the current financial year, the task is daunting as, in the first quarter, barring the FMCG sector, growth for most sectors is expected to be flat. Hence, companies will be under pressure to make up for the slack in the first quarter.

Saurabh Mukherjea, head of equities, Ambit Capital, says the previous three rate cuts by the RBI and the normal monsoon will power corporate earnings in the following quarters. &ldquo;An uptick in central government expenditure in a pre-election year and pick-up in agricultural sector growth should help,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">Harsha Upadhayay, head of equities, Kotak Asset Management, is among those who believe that the earnings picture will improve from the second quarter. Like most fund managers, his optimism comes with a caveat, &ldquo;This expectation could be at risk, if first quarter&nbsp;earnings turn out below the already muted expectation.&rdquo; According to him, the sectors that will deliver promising results this quarter are FMCG, pharma and IT, whereas metal, cement, power and capital goods will disappoint. As for Ambit&rsquo;s Mukherjea, his firm is bullish on oil and gas and technology, and has downgraded estimates for the auto, industrials, real estate and metals sector.

He goes by the name of Prashant Jain, chief investment officer, HDFC AMC, the country&rsquo;s largest asset management company by assets, and who is ranked among the best fund managers ever. So, it&rsquo;s not surprising that given his enviable track record, every stock that he picks or dumps is keenly watched by the investing community. This time around, Jain has dumped one of the market&rsquo;s favourite stocks, Page Industries. The innerwear major has been a darling of the bourses for a while now, with the stock gaining more than 12 times in value since the beginning of 2009. It is a story that investors and analysts couldn&rsquo;t seem to get enough of, thanks to its consistent revenue and earnings growth, strong return ratios and generous payouts. But Jain has used the meteoric rise to jump off the saddle. From July 2011, when the stock began rallying from around Rs 1,900 levels, he has more than halved the holding in HDFC Prudence from 780,000 shares &mdash; which the fund had been holding since March 2008 &mdash; down to 312,000 shares as on date, when the stock is quoting at Rs 4,600. So, why would a top fund manager want to sell a multi-bagger stock? Is the growth story losing momentum or is there still enough steam left to justify Page&rsquo;s lofty valuations? We decided to find out.</p>\n<p class="p3">Page is better known in India for the brand it sells in India &mdash; Jockey. The Genomal family brought the brand to India in 1994, although its association with the Wisconsin-based innerwear maker goes back over 45 years &mdash; the family has been Jockey&rsquo;s licensee in the Philippines since the 1960s. Page Industries has the right to manufacture and distribute Jockey brand innerwear and leisure for men and women not only in India but also in Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh and the UAE. Currently, the company sells Jockey products only in India and Sri Lanka, with plans to start with the UAE and Bangladesh soon. With the licence renewed till 2030, royalty payments are fixed at 5% of sales.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Thus far, it has been a dream run of sorts for Page, thanks to consumers with higher disposable incomes becoming more brand conscious and expansion in modern retail. &ldquo;Aspiration level among consumers is constantly increasing. They are becoming more brand savvy,&rdquo; agrees Sunder &lsquo;Ashok&rsquo; Genomal, managing director, Page Industries. &ldquo;More importantly, they are becoming more discerning, aspiring for better quality, comfort and styling, and that augurs well for us.&rdquo; The industry, pegged at Rs 24,000 crore, consists of three main segments: economy, mid-premium to premium and super premium.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We have been able to maintain consistency in our products since we manufacture everything in-house" - Ashok Genomal, managing director, Page Industries</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">While the overall industry has grown at around 15% over the past five years, the mid-premium to premium range, in which Jockey operates both in the men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s segments, has grown faster at 18% and 17%, respectively. Thanks to its first-mover advantage, consistent quality and distribution network, Page has been able to grow twice as fast as the segment, at 34% in men&rsquo;s innerwear and 44% in women&rsquo;s innerwear, during the same period. &ldquo;We have been able to maintain consistency in our products since we manufacture everything in-house, which gives complete control over quality,&rdquo; says Genomal. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you have the strongest brand if you cannot provide consistent product quality.&rdquo; While it has an overall market share of 13% in the men&rsquo;s segment and 2% in the women&rsquo;s segment, Jockey&rsquo;s share in the organised market is much higher at 20.7% and 11.5%, respectively.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>In ship shape</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">One reason for that is Page&rsquo;s distribution network. &ldquo;Jockey&rsquo;s biggest strength is its distribution network, which new entrants will find very difficult to replicate,&rdquo; concurs Shivani Bhasin Sachdeva, managing director, India Alternatives Investment Advisors (IAIA), which has invested in one of its peers, Gokuldas Intimatewear (which owns women&rsquo;s innerwear brand Enamor). Currently, the company is present across 1,200 cities and its products are sold through 400 distributors in around 23,000 retail outlets and 100 exclusive brand outlets. &ldquo;We have a strong distribution base that can cater to many more years of growth,&rdquo; says Genomal. The premium positioning and price allows Page to give its distributors and retailers hefty margins of 11% and 28%. The exclusive brand outlet (Jockey Zone) owners, who buy from distributors, get around 30%, allowing them to make 20% return on their investment. The number of Jockey Zones rose from 71 in FY12 to 100 outlets in FY13 and Page plans to add another 35-40 outlets in the current fiscal. The company already has 60% share of the organised retail market (large format stores) and as the share of organised retail increases from 18% now to 25% of the overall retail pie, it will put Jockey on a stronger wicket.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Jockey''s biggest strength is the company''s distribution network, which new entrants will find very difficult to replicate" - Shivani Bhasin Sachdeva, managing director, India Alternatives Investment Advisors</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Given that the women&rsquo;s segment is almost double the size of the men&rsquo;s segment (<em>see: Holding strong</em>) and has a larger unorganised portion (60%), analysts expect women&rsquo;s wear to drive revenues in the coming years. The revenue mix is already seeing the change. While boxers and briefs have been the bread-and-butter business bringing more than half of the revenues, the contribution of women&rsquo;s and sportswear has been steadily increasing, from 18% in 2002 to 46.2% in 2013, on the back of stronger volume growth. &ldquo;Growth in men&rsquo;s innerwear segment is likely to be more sedate at around 15%; it is women&rsquo;s and sportswear that is largely under-penetrated and will drive growth,&rdquo; says Basant Maheshwari, private investor and founder of online investment forum The Equity Desk, who bought a chunk of the stock in March 2009 at Rs 350 a share and has since been holding the stock. &ldquo;The company can sustain its growth rate by adding new products and increasing its brand profile. They need to grow by expanding the market,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Holding strong -graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Page is working on that. In addition to shapewear for women, the company recently introduced performance sportswear for men and also launched POP, a premium men&rsquo;s innerwear label with waistbands in vibrant neon colours. In all, it introduced around 32 new styles in 2012&nbsp; across segments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Last year, it also became the exclusive licensee of swimwear brand Speedo &mdash; the brand is already available in 630 outlets across 62 cities and five exclusive outlets. While Speedo contributes a modest 2% (Rs 16 crore) to revenues, analysts expect its share to grow to around 5% in two or three years. Though swimwear market in India is still minuscule at Rs 200 crore, it is expected to grow rapidly helped by the increasing awareness of fitness and staying healthy. Also last year, the company introduced kidswear, which will not only help increase market share but also, hopefully, hook customers for life. In any case, it&rsquo;s a big window for growth: the overall kidswear market is pegged at Rs 48,000 crore but expected to nearly double by 2016 as parents&rsquo; willingness to spend on their children increases.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Power of fashion - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Of course, growing market opportunities come with their own problems. The innerwear market is becoming increasingly crowded. While international brands such as Fruit of the Loom, Calvin Klein, Hanes and Tommy Hilfiger have made their entry in the past few years, domestic players such as Rupa, Lux and VIP are also aspiring to an increasingly premium customer group. Still, Page has managed to hold its own. &ldquo;Some foreign players have not been able to make it work. You cannot just throw marketing dollars and create a brand in this segment. It takes time and only companies that get the customer connect right by understanding buyer behaviour and maintain product quality at reasonable prices will be successful,&rdquo; says IAIA&rsquo;s Sachdeva.</p>\n<p class="p3">To Page&rsquo;s credit, even in the face of growing competition, it has been able to pass on increases in input prices, which indicates its strong brand strength. Over the past two years, price realisation has moved about 10% higher to accommodate rising raw material and labour costs. &ldquo;We have strong pricing power so we have managed to achieve our aim of being an aspirational yet affordable brand despite volatility in material prices such as cotton, particularly in the past couple of years,&rdquo; says Genomal. The company is also ensuring that it is well-equipped to meet the increasing demand. &ldquo;We continue to plan expansion of our capacity at 25% per annum, which will be funded by internal accruals,&rdquo; he adds. In FY13, the company increased its capacity from 110 million pieces the previous year to 135 million pieces at a total cost of Rs 35 crore funded by internal accruals. The average realisation is Rs 108-110 per piece.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>A stretched feeling</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">While greater contribution of higher value and faster growing products such as women&rsquo;s and sportswear bodes well for the company on the revenue front, it could face a problem or two on its working capital and inventory management. Women&rsquo;s and sportswear are prone to quick changes in fashion trends, which means Page needs to maintain more stock keeping units. As a result, its inventory days have moved up from 64 days in FY02 to 100 days in FY13 and with these segments growing in importance, that number is only likely to go up in future.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Increasing inventory levels and capital expenditure have led to a longer working capital cycle and impacted Page&rsquo;s ability to consistently generate free cash flows. According to a report by Emkay Securities, dividend payouts (including tax) have been higher than free cash flows generated since the company&rsquo;s listing in 2007, barring 2012, and this has led to increasing debt levels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In absolute terms, the number isn&rsquo;t alarming &mdash; from Rs 4.9 crore in FY02, debt went up to Rs 88 crore in FY13 and is expected to climb further to Rs 168 crore by FY15, according to Emkay estimates. According to the company, the debt availed comes at very attractive terms under the Technology Upgradation Fund (TUF) so it doesn&rsquo;t really hurt profitability. What is worrying, though, is the inability to generate enough free cash flows to meet dividend payouts, which means the company will have to either reduce its dividend pay ratio or debt on books will keeping increasing on the back of sustained capital expenditure. Genomal, however, believes the company will be able to maintain its payout ratio and that increasing inventory and working capital needs are in line with increase in sales, thereby offering no cause for concern.</p>\n<p class="p3">Revenues over the next two years are expected to grow at an average of 24% coming off the previous five-year average of 38%. While margins are likely to gain from the removal of excise duty of 3.6% on branded garments, which the company has not passed on to its consumers, Page is likely to re-invest the gains in the business through branding initiatives, leaving operating margins stable at around 19-20%. &ldquo;Branding initiatives are important to us because we realise this is not a 100 metre sprint but a marathon. So any excess money we make, we invest in branding,&rdquo; says Genomal. Earnings growth is likely to move up by about 25% during the same period.</p>\n<p class="p3">While there have been concerns on slowdown in consumer spending and the possibility of consumers switching to economy brands, The Equity Desk&rsquo;s Maheshwari feels that at best there could postponement of purchases. &ldquo;Brand stickiness is very high in this business. So there will be no serious threat to Jockey unless they slip on product quality,&rdquo; he says. The company, too, isn&rsquo;t too perturbed by the current slowdown in consumer spending. &ldquo;Our core products [innerwear and basic leisurewear] are relatively non-discretionary, need based and affordable in terms of ticket price. So we see no reason why we should not be able to continue on our growth path, especially as the macro economic situation gets better,&rdquo; says Genomal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Brand stickiness is very high in this business. There will be no serious threat to Jockey unless the company slips on product quality" - Basant Maheshwari, founder, The Equity Desk</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">While the structural story remains intact, it is to be seen whether Page will be able to sustain its dividend payout by generating consistent cash flows without raising additional debt. Revenues and earnings continue to grow at a healthy rate, but the stock could see some de-rating if it doesn&rsquo;t sustain its payout levels. At 35 times estimated FY14 earnings, the valuation looks steep with PEG of more than one. In other words, investors can take the cue from Jain and book profits at current levels.&nbsp;</p>', 'There may not be enough momentum for Page Industries, the local franchisee for Jockey, to keep stretching its multiples  ', '6', '', 0, '', 'will-the-appeal-last-366', 360, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Will the appeal last?', 'There may not be enough momentum for Page Industries, the local franchisee for Jockey, to keep stretching its multiples  ', '', '', '', 'Page Industries,Jockey innerware', 0, NULL, '2015-02-02 11:46:00', '2015-02-02 12:04:23', '2013-08-03', 0),

(368, 24, '', 'Wild and happy', '<p class="p1">Hemendra Kothari feels he should have pursued philanthropy a bit more aggressively, like his father did. But then, it&rsquo;s never too late for the investment banker-turned-philanthropist, who points out that only in the past decade has wealth generation been so high in India. The 66-year-old Kothari knows that well: he raked in Rs 2,250 crore in 2006 by selling his 48% stake in his broking and investment banking firm to Merrill Lynch, and in 2009, offloaded the balance 10% stake for around Rs 500 crore to Bank of America, which, incidentally, took over Merrill in the aftermath of the 2008 credit crisis. He continues to be the non-executive chairman of asset management firm DSP Blackrock Investment Managers, where he holds a 60% stake. &ldquo;Today, Blackrock is bigger than the US Fed,&rdquo; says Kothari, seated in his plush 10th floor office in Mumbai&rsquo;s Nariman Point. &ldquo;In India, the [fund management] story is still to play out as we are yet to see big money coming in from pension and insurance players.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">But even as Kothari is keeping a tab on how his business is growing, he has made time for charitable pursuits. Though his family has been running educational trusts and a hospital in Mumbai for generations, Kothari now wants to perfect, or rather professionalise, the art of giving. &ldquo;First and foremost, after painstakingly creating wealth, it is easier said than done to give it all away,&rdquo; says Kothari, who set up the Hemendra Kothari Foundation (HKF) in 2008. &ldquo;But, having said that, there is also a realisation that you are going to leave it all behind. So, while one should enjoy life to the fullest, you also owe it to society for giving you the opportunity. One, however, needs to ensure that the money doled out is used meaningfully.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Keeping that in mind, HKF engages only with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that have the necessary prerequisites. &ldquo;Through trial and error, we have learnt that not all NGOs make the cut,&rdquo; Kothari notes. &ldquo;Some do not have the ability and some are not committed enough. So we work with organisations that have the execution capability.&rdquo; Also, unlike other foundations or charitable organisations that incur a significant sum on just the upkeep of the staff, Kothari has kept his organisation slim and trim. &ldquo;I have just a 10-12 core member team running the show,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Though they are paid better than NGO standards, what I have got are professionals who are passionate about their work and are not here for monetary considerations.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Today, HKF works closely with the Nashik Education Society (NES), which runs 21 schools in Nashik district (Maharashtra). Earlier, the Kothari family&rsquo;s engagement was restricted to merely acquiring land and constructing school buildings, but today the foundation is focusing more on the quality of education by funding teacher training programmes and vocational training for students. Within NES, HKF is giving a special impetus to schools catering to poor children, such as the Kusumben Kothari Mulinche Shishuvrind (70 girls), the Kamalavati Kothari Mulinchi Prathamik Shala (485 girls) and the DS Kothari Kanyashala (1,590 girls).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Initiatives on the healthcare front are being pursued under the Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT), a project close to Kothari&rsquo;s heart. A green aficionado, Kothari has visited every possible forest in the country and overseas over the past 40 years. &ldquo;What I realised is that forests are essential for our country as they help in conserving water levels. Besides, increasing man-animal conflict is endangering wildlife as well,&rdquo; says the tiger lover. &ldquo;My idea is to supplement government efforts towards conservation, and not to replace them.&rdquo; WCT was set up in 2008 to protect forest ecosystems and mitigate climate change. Noted environmentalists like Bittu Sahgal and Anish Andheria are onboard WCT, which works in 15 states across 82 protected areas. Kothari is now using the WCT platform to empower forest personnel by providing them with vehicles for mobility, solar charging systems for <em>chowkies</em> and personnel work gear.</p>\n<p class="p3">More importantly, WCT aims to wean away villagers from depending on forests as a source of livelihood. &ldquo;Merely educating youths is not enough,&rdquo; Kothari points out. &ldquo;So, we ensure that they can avail of short vocation courses such as plumbing, fabrication and masonry,&nbsp; which will help them get jobs in small towns.&rdquo; WCT also holds health camps in villages along the periphery of forests. &ldquo;We work with local NGOs as well as individuals as they are well-versed with issues at the grass-root level in such villages,&rdquo; says Kothari, who continues to visit the wild once in three months with either his daughters or friends. &ldquo;Forests give me that calming effect and I enjoy doing my bit in return.&rdquo;<span class="s1">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>', 'Forest aficionado Hemendra Kothari wants to professionalise the art of giving through his foundation and wildlife trust', '12', '', 0, '', 'wild-and-happy-368', 362, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Wild and happy', 'Fotest aficionado Hemendra Kothari wants to professionalise the art of giving through his foundation and wildlife trust', '', '', '', 'Hemendra Kothari,Wildlife Conservation Trust,Wildlife,Forests', 0, NULL, '2015-02-02 12:12:00', NULL, '2013-08-03', 0),

The last few years have been quite turbulent for the Indian economy and with each passing day the future looks bleaker than before. The trinity of 5% GDP growth, 5% fiscal deficit and 5% current account deficit makes me wonder whether we are entering a lost decade, with massive wealth destruction for Indian households.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In his maiden book, <em>Spot the Next Economic Bubble,</em> author Saurabh Thirani tries to demystify what lies ahead for all of us, backing his thesis with a strong conceptual framework and a comparison of different economic thoughts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Monetary intervention has led to printing of money at unprecedented levels, triggering speculation in select asset prices.&nbsp; The seeds of coming crises are sown in the resolution of the current crisis. The misguided resolution of the technology bubble gifted the world the US housing bubble.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Thirani believes that the US&rsquo; prescription of averting financial crises by quantitative easing is unsustainable and is another financial disaster in the making. He says we can put the global financial market back in order by following the Austrian School of Economics&rsquo; business cycle theory (ABCT), where the government keeps its intervention to a minimum and lets business run its course. This helps in smooth clearing of inventory and deadwood without triggering another crisis. As the ABCT suggests, spending should be backed by saving rather than money-printing or public debt. The ABCT was able to predict the Great Depression in 1929, the dotcom bubble and the US housing crisis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In India, the Reserve Bank of India has expanded the monetary base at unprecedented levels. Its balance sheet grew by more than 16% yearly during 1997-2013, while expanding 50% in the last three years, more than warranted. The public debt during this period has also gone up on the back of fiscal expansion by the central government. This has resulted in high inflation, general slowdown and a housing bubble in India. Factors like public finances being a shambles, withdrawal of investors, and high persistent inflation have resulted in the depreciation of the national currency and the condition seems ripe for another financial crisis. Thirani&rsquo;s book is a must-read for entrepreneurs, wealth managers, students of economics, capital market participants and anyone who wants an insight into how to avert the financial disaster that awaits us.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Insights</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Do award-winning managers under-perform?</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1">That business awards are highly coveted in any sector and create a pecking <br /> order of managers is well known.

(370, 24, '', 'Till stocks last', '<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By</span> now it&rsquo;s no secret that it is the winter and summer sales of high-street brands that get the glamourati excited even more than the new look and trends of the season. Unless you&rsquo;re an A-lister, with Ferragamo or Canali willing to send you gowns and dinner jackets for your red carpet appearances, the cult of the &ldquo;somewhat known&rdquo; can be punishing on the wardrobe and the wallet. You can&rsquo;t make a public appearance in the same shirt or dress because a relentless media is at hand to record such transgressions as a pair of shoes, or bag, being repeated. Such folly has, alas, permeated even the world of the Page 3 press, so that the average professional or entrepreneur feels the pressure to dress up even for corporate events, if for nothing else because pictures are bound to get uploaded on Facebook before you can say &ldquo;By Zara!&rdquo; The fear of the paparazzi police has led to fashion paranoia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">I hung out around the summer sales this year to see for myself who was picking up the dated outfits &mdash; yep, the life of any garment is six months, and one major public appearance. Even collegiates and tweens wouldn&rsquo;t dream of repeating a dress specially ordered for a friend&rsquo;s <em>sangeet</em> at any other event. So it was natural that they were the ones who were shopping the most. The girls came with their moms, and they tried on saris and gowns, but mostly reports were bleak about the turnover in couture. It was pr&ecirc;t that did better, because even poor little rich kids have to manage budgets, so off-the-shelf offerings moved faster, accessories coming on top of the list: wallets, watches, sunshades &mdash; you get the picture. Casual clothes with formal prices did next-best &mdash; roll-up sleeve shirts, shorts, Ts, zingy jackets, flowing (but not ceremonial) dresses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">I got the sense that a lot of the older people were trousseau shopping, stacking up on saris for <em>buaji</em>, and shawls for <em>mamiji</em>. Or maybe they were just shopping for kitty party-wear, which is something designers haven&rsquo;t done enough justice to in all their talk of wedding outfits and resort-wear. In any case, one person&rsquo;s excess is another person&rsquo;s bling, so it made sense to pile up a stock for <em>shaadi</em> gifts. The more enterprising among them bullied the stores into giving them their regular shopping bags instead of the &ldquo;sale&rdquo; bags that are the prescribed mode for most high-street fashion labels.</p>\n<p class="p3">The serious shoppers all wore dark glasses, almost as though they feared being stalked. They were well-informed and their choices tended towards Western wear and more obvious brands. A shirt under a jacket is hardly likely to look dated, and just how many cuts can a skirt, or even a jacket, have? These were people with &ldquo;known&rdquo; faces you might have a little trouble placing at first instance, and this was probably their equivalent of Sarojini Nagar trawling for best-buys, but they added the most to the stores&rsquo; kitties, and they were fuss-free buyers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">That high-street brands get more footfalls than premium luxury is now well-known, but what&rsquo;s less-known is that this isn&rsquo;t just due to the value differential. Most upscale brands are fussy and snobbish and don&rsquo;t do casual well, while Indian customers are beginning to loosen up and dress down just a little bit without feeling conscious about it &mdash; a sign that they&rsquo;re coming of age.

The Orient isn&rsquo;t normally counted among regions known for good chocolate (the list usually starts with Switzerland and ends with Belgium), but Royce&rsquo; is a 30-year-old brand from Hokkaido that enjoys a cult-like following among connoisseurs. And that is what will ensure its success in India, believe Avani Raheja and Samir Gadhok of Burgundy Hospitality, which has brought the brand to India in an exclusive partnership. &ldquo;Royce&rsquo; is already a familiar name to our target customers &mdash; those who travel abroad, buy from duty-free and appreciate good chocolate,&rdquo; says Raheja, adding that the company will not advertise or &ldquo;push&rdquo; the brand in any way. Instead, she is counting on tasting sessions &mdash; both at the store as well as in targeted groups, such as wedding planners and event managers &mdash; to do the trick. &ldquo;We will let our customers spread the word for us,&rdquo; she adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">Burgundy Hospitality, a start-up that aims to bring fine foods from around the world, spent over 18 months working with Royce&rsquo; on perfecting the supply chain in India. The reason: fresh cream is a critical ingredient in most Royce&rsquo; products, which means they have a very short shelf life of one to three months and spoil very easily. Gadhok and Raheja, therefore, turned to the premium ice cream supply chain for inspiration when preparing for Royce&rsquo;s launch. One reason was the similarity in product &mdash; any temperature abuse, in chocolate or ice cream, will reflect directly in the quality and texture of the product, points out Gadhok. Also, he adds, &ldquo;premium ice cream brands in India face the same paradigm as we do &mdash; both our products are high value, low volume and high sensitivity&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">How are they getting around that? The entire supply chain is under Burgundy&rsquo;s control and the chocolate is imported and stored at -20&deg; C. Royce&rsquo;s Nama range, particularly, is very sensitive to heat, so it is sent home with buyers in a special thermo pack with a cooling gel inside to maintain the ambient temperature. The first Royce&rsquo; store opened in Mumbai last month with 19 varieties of chocolate, priced between #484 for a bar to Rs 995 for 20 pieces of Nama. The selection will be updated every few months but some items will be staples &mdash; such as Royce&rsquo;s nod to junk food: chocolate-coated potato wafers. Burgundy doesn&rsquo;t want Royce&rsquo; to be a luxury-only brand: &ldquo;We want to be everyone&rsquo;s first choice of comfort food,&rdquo; Gadhok says. Potato chips and chocolate, rolled into one &mdash; he&rsquo;s making a good start.&nbsp;</p>', 'Burgundy brings premium chocolates to India', '12', '', 0, '', 'a-taste-of-japan-373', 367, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'A taste of Japan', 'Burgundy brings premium chocolates to India', '', '', '', 'Burgundy Hospitality,Premium chocolates,Royce''', 0, NULL, '2015-02-02 12:40:28', '2015-02-02 12:43:58', '2013-08-17', 0);

(374, 12, '', 'Coming of age', '<p class="p1">Lakshmi Ayakannu is a sprightly 73-year-old with an infectious smile and a love for conversation that helps her make friends easily. Of late, people have been turning to her not just for a quick chat but golfing tips. &ldquo;Champion&rdquo;, as Ayakannu&rsquo;s friends call her, doesn&rsquo;t tee off at the links, nor does she have a caddie or a set of clubs &mdash; she plays in one of the four small, cemented &ldquo;golf courses&rdquo; at Aarogya Kudumbam, a senior citizens&rsquo; retirement community about 17 km from Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu. Ayakannu picked up the sport last year as a change from playing scrabble, chess and darts with the other residents of the complex. Set up in 2008, Aarogya Kudumbam is a 10-acre property with 18 cottages where 34 men and women, all above 55,&nbsp;have moved to spend their post-retirement years. Run by PC Raju, a former doctor and himself a senior citizen, it provides facilities such as round-the-clock medical attention, yoga lessons, a library, cafeteria, housekeeping and, of course, golf. It is also a perfect example of how the market for senior living is growing and promises to be a serious business opportunity.</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>A place of their own- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Aarogya Kudumbam is one of several retirement communities that have sprung up all over India in the past few years (<em>see: A place of their own</em>). And they are to be found not only in Coimbatore, Bengaluru and Pune &mdash; traditionally considered retiree havens &mdash; but also in Goa, Kolkata, Punjab and&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhopal. There are about 30 such projects (many with multiple complexes)&nbsp;across India catering to upper middle class retirees who believe there&rsquo;s no reason the good life should end just because they have reached their golden years and, according to a report by Jones Lang Lasalle (JLL), another 30 are in the pipeline. So, what makes this business so attractive?</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Golden opportunity</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">As with any emerging business in India, the biggest plus is the volume, either existing or potential. The senior living business is no different, thanks to the changing dynamics of Indian society and demographics. Although India is considered a young country, it also has 76 million people above the age of 60, and the expectation is that this number will soar to 173 million by 2025 (<em>see: Silver lining</em>). Until even a few years ago, there was social stigma attached to people moving into senior living projects, but that is fast reducing, particularly among the urban upper middle class, which is the target customer group for most of these projects. These are older people who are well-travelled, well-read, relatively affluent and many with children settled outside India &mdash; those in the sector hold that the trend for setting up such projects started in south India, when the exodus of software engineers to the US in the 1990s left ageing parents back home without support. And thanks to the increasing prevalence of nuclear families, a significant chunk of this age group will be empty nesters in the years to come &mdash; they will be staying separately from their children, even if they are in the same city. Globally, senior living is a $25-billion industry; the US alone has over 2,000 senior housing projects with about 500,000 residents. Given the coming explosion in India&rsquo;s senior citizen numbers, the opportunity in this space will only grow in the years to come.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Silver lining - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Where does the opportunity lie? Not in providing old age homes for destitute senior citizens nor in assisted living for older people who need constant care &mdash; those are very niche businesses still to take off in India. Rather, the space to watch out for is creating communities for active, upmarket older individuals who want to retain their independence yet live in a set-up that caters to their need for practical help, security and companionship. &ldquo;We estimate the current demand for senior housing in India at about 300,000 units,&rdquo; says Deepak Bhavsar, managing director, JLL, whose report on the sector says there are just 5,000 units available across major projects in India.</p>\n<p class="p3">Developers are queueing up to fill the gap. In the next six months, Paranjape Schemes, a Pune-based Rs 2,000-crore group that has five senior living projects under the Athashri banner that together house 1,500 seniors, will launch projects in Hyderabad and Baroda, with others in Chennai and Coimbatore scheduled to be announced before that; there&rsquo;s already a 1,000-unit project underway at Pune. At the other end of the country, Antara Senior Living, a subsidiary company of the Analjit Singh-promoted Max India, is investing Rs 515 crore in a project in Dehradun that will have 217 apartments spread over 820,000 sq ft. Covai Senior Care Construction, which has completed three senior housing projects in Coimbatore and one in Puducherry under the Serene Retirement Communities brand, accounting for over 400 villas, has four more underway in Coimbatore, Puducherry, Chennai and Bengaluru, with 1,300 villas and apartments.&nbsp;Impact Senior Living has a 53-unit project coming up in Amritsar; RakIndo Senior Living is working on a 250-unit complex in Coimbatore; while Bahri Estates is developing 198 villas in Kodaikanal.&nbsp;And Ashiana Housing, which has completed senior living projects in Bhiwadi and Jaipur, is now working on the next one at Lavasa. &ldquo;We are also looking at newer markets in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Our experience has been that customers are willing to pay a premium if the right facilities are offered,&rdquo; says Ankur Gupta, joint managing director, Ashiana Housing.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"There is a clear business proposition here [senior living], but it has to be done with passion" - Shashank Paranjape, managing director, Paranjape Schemes</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">But it&rsquo;s not an easy business, warns Shashank Paranjape, managing director, Paranjape Schemes. &ldquo;Yes, there is a clear business proposition here, but it has to be done with passion. It can&rsquo;t be treated like just another construction,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"For every hundred people who make enquiries, barely four or five make the final investment" - PB Anand, CEO, Covai Senior Care Construction</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s a thought echoed by PB Anand, director and CEO, Covai Senior Care Construction. For every 100 people in the 55-plus age group who make enquiries, barely four or five make the investment, he says. &ldquo;This is really the last big investment that a senior citizen is likely to make,&rdquo; he points out in understanding but adds, &ldquo;There is a healthy payback in the business.&rdquo; Indeed, both Anand and Gupta of Ashiana point to returns of between 25% and 30% on their senior living projects.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Frills needed</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Senior housing projects are usually located on the periphery of a big city (keeping real estate costs low), spread over a larger area, and usually single or two-storeyed structures with more space devoted to community activities and common areas. Paranjape estimates that the cost of construction of a senior living project is at least 30% higher than a premium residential project. Construction extras include wider passageways that can accommodate wheelchairs if needed, hand rails in the bathroom, ramps for easy outside access and anti-skid flooring. Typically, such projects also have larger common areas, including a dining area, library, specialised gym and in some cases, common laundry and medical care facilities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Recreation facilities that don&rsquo;t involve high levels of physical activity (usually seated pastimes such as scrabble, carrom, cards etc.), golf carts for moving around, a temple and transportation facilities for going into town are usually par for the course. Most complexes include only kitchenettes for basic heating of beverages etc., and meals and housekeeping are provided in the package &mdash; that means a senior living facility also employs more staff than a regular housing complex. All of which adds to the cost of such projects.</p>\n<p class="p3">Not surprisingly, developers in the senior living space have a very clear target customer in mind for their projects. While some local developers open their doors only for specific communities, for those above a certain age, without certain illnesses, or with dietary restrictions, there&rsquo;s a common thread tying them with big developers &mdash; senior living projects in India are mainly geared towards relatively well-off older individuals. (The really big developers are yet to enter this space. But existing players in the senior living space believe it&rsquo;s only a matter of time: as the sector picks up steam and large developers sort out their current problems with high debt and inventories, they will turn their attention to senior living.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The challenge for someone in the business, thus, is to offer the right facilities at the right price and still make money out of the proposition. That&rsquo;s where the Indian model appears to be different from how senior living operates in the rest of the world.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>High pay-offs</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Strictly speaking, there are three ways in which developers offer senior homes to buyers but going by the evidence, only one&nbsp;&nbsp;is really popular. Long leases and monthly rentals are available across several properties but haven&rsquo;t really taken off. In the former, the resident puts down a deposit (which may not be totally refundable) and pays a monthly fee in addition; he has no rights over the property and it reverts to the developer when the lease is up. At Aarogya Kudumbam, for instance, all units are available on a long lease, points out founder Raju. &ldquo;We operate on a no-profit, no-loss basis, so the deposit is refunded when the arrangement ends,&rdquo; he adds. That&rsquo;s an exception: in most long leases, some portion of the deposit, if not all of it, in non-refundable.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"We operate on a no-profit, no-loss basis, so the deposit is refunded when the arrangement ends" - PC Raju, founder, Aarogya Kudumbam</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Monthly rental arrangements are also not popular because of the lack of security regarding tenure for the senior citizen, although they do find takers with older people who want to either try out a community or need to stay only for a limited period.&nbsp;The bulk of deals in senior living communities, though, happen through outright sale of property. Serene&rsquo;s Anand attributes that primarily to the Indian psyche, which finds comfort in owning property. &ldquo;It brings a sense of security and comfort to the resident that he will not be asked to leave the property,&rdquo; he points out. Moreover, in the other models where the resident pays a monthly fee for staying in the complex, there is no guarantee that the fee won&rsquo;t increase in the future, which may hurt the senior&rsquo;s finances.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Besides, if the resident ever needs the money, he always has the option of selling the property at the current market price since these are usually freehold,&rdquo; Anand adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">And prices at some of these communities are certainly rising fast, if not faster than regular real estate projects. Ask Arvind Bhalerao. The 81-year-old retired PSU executive bought his 630 sq ft apartment at Paranjape&rsquo;s Athashri project in Pashan, Pune, in 2004 for Rs 10 lakh. Now, he says, he&rsquo;s getting offers for close to Rs 50 lakh. &ldquo;That was unexpected,&rdquo; says Bhalerao, adding hastily that he has no plans to sell.</p>\n<p class="p3">There are advantages for the builder, too, with such a model, the biggest being quicker and higher returns. It also helps that units can be sold even as construction is ongoing, ensuring a steady revenue stream. In an ownership model, the resident pays anywhere upward of Rs 20 lakh for a unit in a senior living project &mdash; as with any real estate development, prices depend on the area, how posh it is and what&rsquo;s on offer. Antara Senior Living, for instance, plans to charge a jaw-dropping Rs 7 crore for a penthouse in its Dehradun retirement community. Amenities at the project, which will be completed by end-FY16, will include yoga and meditation facilities and proximity to a group-owned Max Hospital,&nbsp;and most apartments will carry tags of Rs 1.5-4.5 crore. &ldquo;Our target customers are people who are used to living in large homes. We want to provide them the same level of luxury once they retire. We will sell the apartments using the referral model, which will ensure we pick our buyers carefully. There is a market for people who want to live very well,&rdquo; says Tara Singh, Analjit Singh&rsquo;s daughter and CEO of Antara Senior Living. And remember, that&rsquo;s just the price of buying the property &mdash; at Antara, residents will also have to pay Rs 29,000 a month to enjoy the facilities on offer and pay an additional Rs 16 per sq ft as maintenance (the apartments range between 1,400 and 5,000 sq ft).</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Playing it safe - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Indeed, all residents of a senior community, regardless of their mode of residency, pay monthly charges for food, electricity, medical care, telephone, internet and other services, which is over and above what they pay for staying in the complex. According to JLL&rsquo;s Bhavsar, residents in any senior living facility today have a monthly outgo of between Rs 3,000 and Rs 20,000. &ldquo;Services offered would range from food, healthcare and wellness, security, audio-visual libraries and social engagement, among other things. Food is the largest expense and accounts for 25-30% of the spend, while housekeeping takes away another 20%.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We want to provide people used to living in large homes the same level of luxury when they retire" - Tara Singh, CEO, Antara Senior Living</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But the way forward is with the deferred fee model, believes MH Dalal, chairman, Oasis Senior Citizens Communes. Here, the buyer pays 25% less than market price and after a lock-in period, owns the property. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be responsible for maintenance and upkeep of the premises and if the buyer opts out or dies before the lock-in ends, he (or his heir) gets 10-25% of the appreciated value,&rdquo; Dalal explains. Oasis, which already runs Golden Nest, a senior living project in Pune, will offer the deferred lease model at its new project in Talegaon, where it is investing Rs 30 crore in 100 units. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other way to get more people to invest in senior living when prices are so high,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Deferred fees is the preferred model to get more people to invest when prices are so high" - MH Dalal, chairman, Oasis Senior Citizen Communes</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">But, increasingly, senior citizens in India seem willing to pay a little extra for the pleasure of being with like-minded people of similar age, live in comfortable, spacious homes in salubrious climes and leave behind the grind of big cities. Shama Vijayan, who returned after retirement in Dubai to become a Golden Nest resident, sums it up: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better for seniors to live on their own. We can&rsquo;t keep pace with modern lifestyles and it&rsquo;s a relief to be away from metros.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s music to the ears of developers such as Paranjape, Anand and Gupta.&nbsp;</p>', 'The growing market for senior living promises to be a serious business opportunity in the coming years ', '7', '', 0, '', 'coming-of-age-374', 368, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Coming of age ', 'The growing market for senior living promises to be a serious business opportunity in the coming years ', '', '', '', 'Senior citizen homes,Senior housing projects,Antara Senior Living,Covai Senior Care Construction,Serene Retirement Communities', 0, NULL, '2015-02-02 12:46:44', '2015-02-02 13:11:43', '2013-08-17', 0),
(375, 16, '', 'Close connect', '<p class="p1">The radio ads on air say it bluntly &mdash; you&rsquo;d be a fool to not snap up this deal. And certainly, Reliance Communications (RCom) seems intent on making 3G consumers an offer they can&rsquo;t refuse: it has halved 3G data charges across all plans, bringing its rates on par or even lower than what some operators charge for 2G. Consumers using 3G on RCom can now get 1GB data at Rs 123, where Bharti, Idea and Vodafone charge Rs 125 for 1GB on 2G technology and Rs 245-250 for similar usage of 3G. That&rsquo;s great news for users and perhaps RCom is justified in thinking it will add new subscribers by the droves, but does the deal make business sense for the telecom major?</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>Casting the net wide - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">A little over three years ago, mobile operators paid staggering sums for 3G spectrum. While RCom forked out Rs 8,585 crore for spectrum in 13 circles, Bharti Airtel paid Rs 12,295 crore for the same number of circles. The recovery of this investment depended not just on getting in a large number of subscribers but making them spend well on 3G services as well. So far, that&rsquo;s not happening. Currently, barely 5% of the total 850 million mobile users are 3G users with an average revenue per user (Arpu) of just Rs 60 in Q4FY13; net additions every month, too, are only around 2 million. In comparison, voice Arpu for Bharti Airtel was Rs 193 for the same period and Rs 167 for Idea.</p>\n<p class="p3">Rajiv Sharma, associate director, HSBC Securities, says it will be challenging for RCom to recover spectrum costs. &ldquo;Our analysis suggests that post the tariff cuts, it will need to have around 200 million data subscribers using at least 400 MB to have a NPV-positive 3G business,&rdquo; he explains. Current numbers are nowhere close to that, although RCom has the highest number of 3G subscribers, 7.2 million, followed by Bharti with 6.4 million. And while low tariffs will make 3G plans more attractive to subscribers in category B circles, which have been slow to adopt the technology, a bigger hurdle is the need for 3G-compatible handsets. &ldquo;Data faces a challenge from the device to be used,&rdquo; concurs Sashi Shankar, chief marketing officer, Idea Cellular. Certainly, handset prices have been coming down steadily, but 3G smartphones are still more expensive than 2G ones. Besides, he adds, &ldquo;Operators like us need to not only get in more 3G users but also get more out of the existing base.&rdquo; A recent Nokia Siemens Network report says that after the pan-industry drop in 3G tariffs last year, 3G services accounted for a third of total mobile data in H2CY12, compared with a fourth in the first half. The takeaway for RCom? If its offer not only lures in new users but tempts existing subscribers into surfing more, perhaps the party won&rsquo;t be completely one-sided.&nbsp;</p>', 'Will RCom''s 3G offer ring in the numbers?', '7', '', 0, '', 'close-connect-375', 369, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Close connect ', 'Will RCom''s 3G offer ring in the numbers?', '', '', '', 'Reliance Communications,3G spectrum', 0, NULL, '2015-02-02 13:13:26', '2015-02-02 13:17:28', '2013-08-17', 0),
(376, 16, '', 'Going for the till', '<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I</span>t came as a complete surprise,&rdquo; laughs Lachhman Das Mittal, referring to his debut last year on the list of the 100 richest Indians. With $785 million in his kitty, at 75<sup>th</sup> place, he is ahead of Naresh Goyal (Jet Airways), Onkar Kanwar (Apollo), Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw (Biocon) and Shobhana Bhartia (HT Media), among others. But clearly, this is not the achievement the 82-year-old Mittal is excited about. The founder and chairman of the Sonalika Group, whose company International Tractors (ITL) makes the Sonalika brand of tractors, beams when his son Amrit Sagar Mittal talks of how the company is climbing the ranks in the tractor market. &ldquo;Last year, we displaced John Deere from the fourth place and we&rsquo;re closing in quickly on Escorts,&rdquo; says the ITL vice-chairman. &ldquo;We grew by double digits last year even as the industry growth rate fell 3%,&rdquo; adds the senior Mittal. Indeed, while market leader Mahindra &amp; Mahindra&rsquo;s (M&amp;M) volumes fell 5% to 223,885 last fiscal, ITL saw sales climb 23% to 58,300.</p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The difference between M&amp;M and Sonalika is still massive, but it&rsquo;s not bad going at all for a company that entered the tractor business less than two decades ago. Where the top three players &mdash; M&amp;M, Tafe and Escorts &mdash; have been around in the business for close to half a century, Sonalika, which has been selling farm equipment since the 1960s, began making tractors only in 1995. Today, it is among the top five manufacturers that together account for more than 90% of total industry volumes of 590,915 <em>(see: Digging deep)</em>. And ITL&rsquo;s growth run did not pass unnoticed.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class="p3">Private equity major Blackstone picked up 12.5% stake in the company last October for #520 crore, valuing the company at #4,200 crore. Now, the Delhi-headquartered ITL is moving to high gear: in the next two years, it wants to increase tractor sales to 100,000 units a year, establish a pan-India presence and race ahead of Escorts. Can it successfully plough its way to the top?</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>The reluctant tractor-maker</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Ironically, LD never wanted to make tractors. In the 1990s, to appease farmers and dealers who bought Sonalika farm equipment and insisted the company&rsquo;s portfolio was incomplete, he built just two tractors and sent them for six-month field trials with negative expectations. They came back with zero-defect reports, and a visit to the government testing facility in Bhopal yielded similar results. LD was still on the fence when some farmers visited him in Delhi. &ldquo;One of them opened his turban, took out Rs 5,000 and put it on my table. He said, &ldquo;Your tractor was tested on my farm near Bhopal and I want to book the first machine.&rdquo; After that, it would not have been right to still resist making tractors,&rdquo; he recalls. The first workshop at Hoshiarpur, Punjab, was set up with Rs 22 crore raised from Sonalika&rsquo;s dealers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Three years later, LD received another visitor at his office, a European. &ldquo;I thought he was a tourist, wanting to come in out of the sun for a while,&rdquo; he says. Instead, he turned out to be a representative of Renault, surveying the Indian tractor market. Soon after, directors from the French company visited the Sonalika&rsquo;s workshop in Punjab, but were very critical of the standards and processes. A return visit by LD and his sons to the Renault factory showed them why. They returned to Hoshiarpur, demolished the workshop and built a spanking new facility in the next six months. A satisfied Renault then entered into a technical partnership with ITL in late 2000. There was no looking back after that. From 356 tractors in FY96, ITL today sells 164 times that number. The partnership with Renault ended in 2003 after the French company sold its tractor business to Class of Germany, but ITL has a new foreign partner, Yanmar of Japan, which also holds a 12% stake in the company. While that&rsquo;s one reason for its successful run, it&rsquo;s not the only one.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>A high-growth environment</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">A favourable environment has played a large role in Sonalika&rsquo;s growth. Over the past 10 years, the tractor industry has seen double-digit growth for a better part: CAGR of over 20% between FY04 and FY07, barring a couple of years of negative and flat growth. What&rsquo;s worked in its favour is the increasing &ldquo;tractorisation&rdquo; of Indian agriculture &mdash; from 14.4 tractors per 100 operational landholders in 2002, the number more than doubled to 31.1 by 2007, according to a Kotak Institutional Equities report. AM Sahni, former deputy CEO of M&amp;M Swaraj division, lists the reasons that led to this dramatic change. &ldquo;Many new states such as Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have become significant markets. Then, non-farm usage has also come up, for landfills, construction activity, pulling water tanks, etc. Labour shortage due to MGNREGA is also resulting in mechanisation and there is some demand from the bottom of the pyramid segment for low horsepower (HP) tractors,&rdquo; he says. Certainly, with minimum support prices for agriculture nearly doubling in the past seven years, more farmers are able to own sophisticated farm equipment, including tractors (<em>see: Green bounty</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In fact, it is cheaper to run a 15 HP tractor than own bullocks, according to the Kotak report. Easy availability of credit is another reason why tractor penetration has improved &mdash; close to 95% of all tractors in the country are sold on credit and less paperwork and easy terms makes the decision to buy a tractor simpler. And where conventional markets such as Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh have been saturated for decades, the shrinking replacement cycle of tractors (from 10-12 years to 8-10 years) means replacement demand has been growing at 8% in these markets.</p>\n<p class="p3">So much for the industry. What has ITL done to increase Sonalika&rsquo;s sales? &ldquo;A great advantage was that we had already been making farm equipment for decades. We knew first-hand what farmers required,&rdquo; says AS Mittal, adding that features such as ability to withstand continuous use, lower maintenance and higher pulling power helps Sonalika tractors stand out. There&rsquo;s also ITL&rsquo;s aggressive approach in the markt, points out a senior executive from New Holland Tractors. &ldquo;Sonalika has always offered heavy discounts and exchange schemes to gain market share,&rdquo; he says. Dealers in Punjab, Sonalika&rsquo;s stronghold, agree, although AS Mittal categorically denies being a market disruptor. &ldquo;Price doesn&rsquo;t bring volumes. Similar products are usually in a price band with a difference of #7,000-8,000, which hardly matters since most farmers get their tractors financed. What matters is performance and resale value,&rdquo; he points out. Analysts and competitors don&rsquo;t agree fully &mdash; their take is that while ITL was definitely playing the price and discounts game earlier, it has let up now as it wants to be seen as a responsible, national brand.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">According to industry observers, rising non-farm demand for tractors (for pulling luggage convoys at airports, at construction sites, etc.) has also worked in Sonalika&rsquo;s favour as it has products in the above 50 HP segment, which today account for 27% of its total sales. Shishir Kumar, senior analyst with Icra, points out that non-farm usage of tractors make up 30% of overall industry demand, and that&rsquo;s quite a large number. However, Sonalika will now have to face the heat from M&amp;M, which, too, has invested #350 crore in a completely new platform, M Star, that will roll out models in the above 50 HP category. Rajesh Jejurikar, chief executive, tractor and farm mechanisation, M&amp;M, was quoted in the media, saying, &ldquo;Clearly, 50 HP and above is the emerging segment and will grow. M Star has been conceptualised to leverage and grow that segment.&rdquo; For now, though, the momentum is with Sonalika. Virendra Jain, a tractor dealer at Dabra in Madhya Pradesh, switched from selling Escorts to Sonalika in 2005. &ldquo;Times have changed. Sonalika, with its high HP models, is a big hit in my area,&rdquo; he explains. But will that be enough to sustain and indeed accelerate the momentum in the coming years?</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Stepping on the gas</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Sonalika is certainly not short on ambition. Between FY11 and FY13, it sold an additional 13,709 tractors and wants to sell three times that much in the next two years. How does it plan to achieve that? For starters, it is ramping up capacity. In 2010, a greenfield manufacturing facility was commissioned at Fatuah, Bihar, with a capacity of 20,000 units a year, while last year the Hoshiarpur factory was expanded by 20,000. &ldquo;By December, we will double capacity at Hoshiarpur, from 75,000 to 150,000,&rdquo; adds AS Mittal. The Bihar plant was ITL&rsquo;s first step outside Punjab, a two-pronged strategy to augment capacity as well as reach. &ldquo;We want to extend our green revolution from the north-west to eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and the north-east,&rdquo; declares LD Mittal. The dealer and service network is also being expanded, from 700 to over 1,000 touchpoints in the next two years. &ldquo;There should be a dealer within 25 kms of a farmer,&rdquo; explains AS Mittal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But the big push for Sonalika will have to come from south India, where it has only a marginal presence. &ldquo;Well-irrigated regions such as Punjab, Haryana and west UP are not as vulnerable to the monsoon as the rest of the country and hence, volumes here are less volatile. With South and West being large-volume markets, typically, when growth is strong in these markets, overall industry volume growth remains strong,&rdquo; points out Icra&rsquo;s Kumar. Breaking into new markets won&rsquo;t be easy. Where Sonalika has built a reputation for itself in the north thanks to its farm equipment, it&rsquo;s an unknown, untested entity in the south. M&amp;M has a market share of 48% in south India and 46% in west India, while Tafe has 23% and 20%, respectively. ITL&rsquo;s share: 5% in south and 9% in the west.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class="p3">Changing mindsets in the south won&rsquo;t come easy for Sonalika. P Govindarajan is a farmer from Tavariampakkam village in Tamil Nadu&rsquo;s Kanchipuram district who grows paddy and vegetables on his 12-acre plot. He bought a Mahindra 575 DI last year to replace his 10-year-old tractor, also a Mahindra. &ldquo;I have heard of Sonalika, there are one or two tractors in nearby villages. I saw no reason to try it since I have had a good experience with Mahindra,&rdquo; he says. LD Mittal doesn&rsquo;t appear bothered by such steadfast customers. &ldquo;Loyalty is created by quality and performance. When they see better product, loyalties will change,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Still, if ITL is to achieve its stated goal of 10% market share in south India this year, perhaps it would do well to first bring mechanics over to its side before targeting farmers. Sahni concurs. &ldquo;It is always better to expand slowly in new markets and build aftersales network alongside. Entering a new market requires all-round attention: you need to check unsold inventory, improve processes at the dealer-end and energise your teams as well,&rdquo; he advises.</p>\n<p class="p3">The Mittals are well aware of the challenges and have already taken the first steps to gain a foothold in the south. In the past year, warehouses have been set up in Vijaywada, Warangal, Hughli and Madurai; the company has also entered into five new C&amp;F agreements and reduced the transportation time to dealers from one month to just three days. &ldquo;We have also approached all four state governments in south India for land and Karnataka has already given us an offer. Once we hear from all states, we will select the best offer and build a plant in south India,&rdquo; says LD. Sahni points out that owning a plant in the region is not a necessary condition for success. &ldquo;Tafe is No.1 in Rajasthan but it doesn&rsquo;t have an assembly line up north and Massey Ferguson used to sell well in Punjab but was manufactured in the south. Similarly, Swaraj sells outside Punjab as well. Depots and warehouses can serve you well as long as you do all other things well,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Cyriac Matthew, senior managing director, Blackstone, does not read too much into Sonalika&rsquo;s perceived weakness. &ldquo;They are a very strong regional player, a very well-run family business that can become national,&rdquo; he says, pointing to the results of the due diligence the fund did before putting in money. Besides conducting over 30,000 surveys across different markets and different products, the PE fund went as far as buying older Sonalika tractors and testing them before making investments. &ldquo;Sonalika scored very high on all parameters,&rdquo; points out Matthew.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">For its part, ITL says the crucial part of its strategy in the south will be to demonstrate its product and its utility. To this effect the company has been holding demonstrations in local communities, showing off the tractors&rsquo; pulling power. ITL is also pushing its 50HP-plus tractors in this market, since soil in the region is harder and needs more effort. All of which should help it grow.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Beyond borders</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Already, revenue has gone up three-fold in the past six years, while PAT has jumped six times even as tractor sales volumes doubled <em>(see: Bumper harvest)</em>. And, this is a zero-debt company. &ldquo;We put even our own dividends back into the company,&rdquo; says LD Mittal proudly. His son points out that Blackstone investment &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t really required for expansion&rdquo; but adds, &ldquo;You are known by the company you keep&rdquo;. Indeed, father and son say they &ldquo;would like Blackstone to interfere&rdquo; in ITL&rsquo;s working &mdash; improving processes and systems as ITL prepares for its second growth phase.</p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In the next five years, rising outlay towards agriculture schemes and higher mechanisation are expected to keep the industry&rsquo;s overall volume CAGR at 8-9%. But ITL is also looking at a much higher share of exports to grow above the industry average. ITL already exports to about 70 countries and has set up assembly lines in Nigeria, Cameroon, Algeria, Brazil and Argentina, co-owned with local distributors. LD believes Sonalika tractors are a perfect fit in these markets: &ldquo;Farmers there want simple and robust machines that they can repair themselves. Our machines meet those criteria,&rdquo; he says. Now, the idea is to focus on higher HP tractors and reach out to developed markets in Europe and the United States.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class="p3">There&rsquo;s a good reason for looking outside India &mdash; a tractor sold overseas fetches 30% higher margin than a unit sold locally. Currently, ITL has international sales of about 10,000 tractors a year, which accounts for 17% of its revenues. Going forward, AS Mittal wants 30% of the increased sales of 100,000 tractors to come from exports. In volume terms, however, ITL is only 5th in the pecking order.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s2">International players as well as Indian companies with international collaborations have been using the country&rsquo;s low-cost manufacturing base to cater to markets outside as well. The result: John Deere, Tafe, M&amp;M and New Holland are all ahead of ITL in exports from India. But there is opportunity in this challenge, believes Kumar of Icra. &ldquo;Overall export volumes are not high, just around 70,000. So, the potential is high for all players,&rdquo; he points out. But Sonalika will need to do more than just export if it is to achieve its targets.</span></p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mittal is not worried, though. &ldquo;We are at just 10% in India [marketshare]. By expanding reach and network, it shouldn&rsquo;t be difficult to get to 15-16%,&rdquo; he says. Much of that will depend on the Mittals winning friends and influencing customers in the hinterland. LD Mittal feels Sonalika has not one but two points in its favour. &ldquo;When a promoter runs a company, he uses not only his brain but also his heart. Two, in professionally-run company, it takes months for a proposal to be implemented. Here, we sit in the evening with a cup of tea and next morning, it&rsquo;s implemented,&rdquo; he declares. Given their ambitions, looks like the Mittals will be drinking a lot of tea in the months to come. </span><span class="s4">&beta;</span></p>', 'Sonalika is looking to up the ante in the tractor market after ousting John Deere from fourth spot.

(378, 20, '', 'The deepening rot', '<p class="p1">The benchmark index may be flirting with 20K levels, but the undertone remains far from bullish. A case in point is companies that had issued foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) at the height of the bull run; most of them are now facing defaults as post 2008 crisis, their share prices have hit the nadir. Currently, over 40 Indian convertible issues are past their due dates, with promoters obligated to pay over $2 billion to bondholders since the conversion prices are way below the issue price. According to London-based KNG Securities, the bulk of Indian convertibles was issued between 2005 and 2007. &ldquo;At the time, Indian issuers thought their shares were going to the stars and, hence, repayment provisions were not a consideration. The unpredicted and seismic events of 2008 ended the party and Indian issuers suddenly found themselves staring at a rather large debt pile,&rdquo; states a KNG report. Not surprisingly, the number of convertible issues has fallen from the peak of 72 in 2007 to around four in CY13.</p>\n<p class="p3">While most issuers are in restructuring talks with bondholders, many companies don&rsquo;t seem to be in a position to do so. &ldquo;Many investors will question whether these companies ever had the ability to repay foreign convertible investors,&rdquo; says Arup Ganguly, founder, KNG, highlighting the defaults by Prime Focus and Suryajyoti Spinning.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>It''s all downhill - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">What is further compounding the problem is currency depreciation. The rupee has depreciated almost 20% in the June quarter and, importantly, a whopping 33% since the 2005-2007 period, when the bulk of issuance occurred. To address the issue, the RBI has allowed companies to raise external commercial borrowings to retire/ refinance the FCCBs. Of the $32 billion worth of overseas commercial borrowings raised in FY13, around 11% was used for addressing FCCB redemption and refinancing of ECBs and domestic loans. In fact, Suzlon, which has outstanding FCCBs worth $500 million, had raised $647 million via Eurobonds earlier this year to refinance existing debt. But the beleaguered wind turbine maker could raise the funds largely because it carried a safety net in terms of bank guarantee. &ldquo;Since the Suzlon bonds are guaranteed by SBI, the credit risk is on the bank and not the company,&rdquo; says Ganguly.</p>\n<p class="p3">Not all companies are as lucky to benefit from the largesse of Indian banks. Most bondholders will either have to drag the issuer to court or stick it out through negotiations. &ldquo;For most institutional investors, their Indian holdings are not a significant enough part of their overall portfolios to warrant going through the legal process and only those fund managers who have a local presence and are willing to sit in court to see the process through, succeeded in squeezing money out of delinquent promoters,&rdquo; says Ganguly, adding, &ldquo;We are yet to hear of another success story following the Wockhardt win.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>', 'Convertible bond holders find their backs against the wall as corporate India''s outstanding defaults surge to over $2 billion ', '5', '', 0, '', 'the-deepening-rot-378', 372, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'The deepening rot ', 'Convertible bond holders find their backs against the wall as corporate India''s outstanding defaults surge to over $2 billion ', '', '', '', 'FCCBs,RBI', 0, NULL, '2015-02-02 14:42:32', '2015-02-02 14:49:25', '2013-08-17', 0);

(379, 20, '', 'Wait, don''t Justdial', '<p class="p1">A 300 sq ft garage in Malad, borrowed equipment and rented computers &mdash; when VSS Mani set up Justdial in 1996 with just Rs 50,000, the business didn&rsquo;t have a lot going for it. Since he didn&rsquo;t have the Rs 15,000 needed for an immediate MTNL connection, Mani had already waited for more than a year for a telephone that was vital for the voice-based directory service he wanted to establish. It didn&rsquo;t help that he had already tried his hand at setting up a telephonic directory some seven years earlier in Delhi, and failed. Sure enough, the beginning was especially tough. With five employees to pay, not only did Mani not draw a salary, his wife mortgaged her jewellery to keep Justdial afloat. Seventeen years later, the company is the leader in the search services space with 9.1 million listings in FY13 and its founder isn&rsquo;t doing badly either: the 46-year-old, who quit chartered accountancy midway to become an entrepreneur, today drives a BMW 7 series and the recently concluded IPO catapulted his net worth to over Rs 1,300 crore: Rs 87 crore came from selling nearly 1.56 million shares in the IPO, while his 33% holding was valued at Rs 1,241 crore on the day&nbsp;of listing.</p>\n<p class="p3">The Justdial IPO was one of India&rsquo;s most successful listings by a technology entrepreneur. What makes it extra special for Mani is that he listed his baby after five previous failed attempts &mdash; twice on Nasdaq, two aborted filings in India in the last two years and once, the idea of listing on a smaller exchange. This time, after initial lacklustre retail participation, a few carrots were thrown to the retail public, including a Sebi-mandated safety net to buy back stock should the share price fall post-IPO, and a discount of 10% on the issue price of Rs 530 per share. The result: the IPO was oversubscribed 12 times, selling 175,000 shares, with FIIs and mutual funds being the largest subscribers with 75% of the allotment, and HNIs and retail investors accounting for the rest. PE investors in Justdial earned a stupendous 850% return on their investments and Mani became the first Indian internet entrepreneur with a successful listing since Deep Kalra listed Makemytrip on Nasdaq three years ago. Justdial is also the biggest domestic IPO so far in CY13 and the strong debut has continued with the stock quoting 28% higher at Rs 679 against its issue price of Rs 530 a share.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>The business model</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">How does Justdial work? An SME or small business service provider lists with the company for no charge, while those wanting to be listed at the top of the rankings pay a subscription. The premium listing is divided into three categories (platinum, gold and silver) and packages can be weekly, monthly, quarterly or annually. As of March 31, 2013, Justdial has approximately 206,500 campaigns for its paid advertisers, a growth of 21% compared with 171,000 campaigns the previous year, and a 5.8% increase since end-December 2012. This translates to around 2.2% paid listings out of the total 9.1 million listings on the site <em>(see: The hit list)</em>. According to analysts, Justdial&rsquo;s platform is accessed by around 19 million unique users across India, of which the top 11 cities account for about 17 million, or nearly 90%. Going by the user base, the company has penetrated just 38% of the total addressable market in the top 11 cities where it has a presence.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>The hit list - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Analysts believe that given the number of quality leads generated by Justdial and the subsequent higher return on investment accruing to its clients, this figure could ascend rapidly in future. &ldquo;In the early days, we went door-to-door trying to convince hard-nosed businessmen to take the risk of using our service. After a year or two, they would call us back enthused by the quality of our services, asking for more products and services,&rdquo; recalls a jubilant Mani. That record is holding strong: 70% of Justdial&rsquo;s paid listings even today are repeat customers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Look, quote, buy - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Over the years, Justdial has expanded its reach to include a website and in 2007, mobile search services covering 40 cities. This was just after it received funding from a PE investor: Saif Partners. Today, the management is betting big on the potential for growth in both internet-enabled smartphones and broadband internet services. Mani points out that the share of voice in total searches dropped from 64% in 2009 to 39% currently, as cell phones become ubiquitous and Indians increasingly turn to the net. &ldquo;Today, India&rsquo;s internet penetration is only 11.4%, compared with other Bric nations where the number is in the 40s. We see a huge opportunity for penetration in India to explode due to the mushrooming of internet-enabled smartphones for as cheap as Rs 5,000 at the lower end,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We see a huge opportunity for net penetration in India to explode due to the mushrooming of cheap internet-enbled smartphones" - VSS Mani, founder and CEO, Justdial</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Most studies bear out those projections. As internet penetration grows to an expected 30% by FY16 &mdash; when India will also become the third-largest smartphone market in the world &mdash; the share of the online classifieds market is also expected to grow (<em>see: Look, quote, buy</em>). Research agency Netscribes says this increases the potential market for Justdial to Rs 3,940 crore by FY16 from Rs 1,580 crore in FY12, a CAGR of 26%. Similarly, teledensity is set to increase by a CAGR of 6% till FY16. Little wonder, then, that Mani is optimistic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Top of the heap</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">What sets Justdial apart from the competition? First off, there is the easily recalled hotline number and a well-known brand ambassador &mdash; Amitabh Bachchan, who incidentally also picked up about 63,000 shares of the company at Rs 10 each in February 2011. Both these have helped establish brand identity and recall, ahead of rivals such as AskMe, Zomato, Burrp and Asklaila. Then, there is its huge database. The next largest player is AskMe &mdash; which, ironically, is the company Mani first helped set up &mdash; but despite being older, the Delhi-based company lags considerably behind in listings, with only around 3 million names in its database. Mani also invests much effort on maintaining the database&rsquo;s accuracy. &ldquo;We do a lot of regression-oriented data analysis, which helps us clean data, which in turn makes the entire search process learning-oriented,&rdquo; he says. The one-on-one relationship with SMEs built over the years is another advantage: Justdial executives meet with potential SME advertisers and explain the benefits of listing and converting to a paid membership. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In FY09, Justdial also rolled out evergreen contracts, a payment mechanism for advertisers to pay for their listings on a weekly and monthly basis against the earlier annual system. &ldquo;We believe this helps to increase the paid subscriber base and most importantly, act as a big entry barrier for any new entrant/existing competitor. We also expect this move to substantially improve the percentage of paid advertisers from 2.4% in FY12 to 3.1% in FY15E, thereby driving growth,&rdquo; says Niket Shah of Motilal Oswal. Justdial also has a massive marketing team of more than 7,000 employees whom it offers cash incentives to convert free listers to paid: 2% of the contract value goes to the tele sales executives and 4% to the marketing executive who make this happen.</p>\n<p class="p3">Equally importantly, Justdial operates an asset-light model where costs are kept to a minimum, giving it operational leverage &mdash; even collecting new entries for the database has been outsourced to a third party to save time and money. But, at 49% of total costs, employee costs account for the largest chunk, so how does that give Justdial operational leverage? &ldquo;You must remember that as revenue grows, employee costs, which were 69% in FY09, have fallen to 49% today and are expected to fall further,&rdquo; explains Abhishek Shindadkar, analyst with ICICI Securities. Also, Justdial has already incurred costs in getting paid listings. So any incremental growth in revenue will be non-linear. And with the shift towards mobile internet searches, additional infrastructure costs to facilitate this may not be proportional to revenue growth, Shindadkar adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"As revenue grows, employee costs, which were 69% in FY09, have fallen to 49% today and are expected to fall further" - Abhishek Shindadkar, analyst, ICICI Securities&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Of course, non-linear revenue growth is contingent on the service maintaining its quality and leadership position since it requires people to renew their subscriptions. As a report by Emkay points out, &ldquo;At present, 70% of paid listing members are the ones who have paid Justdial in the past. This clearly points to the fact that the return on their investment (fees) is high, though 30% of members have not renewed their business with JD.&rdquo; Needless to say, Mani would like to see that ratio improve, which is why he is working so hard to stand out from his rivals.</p>\n<p class="p6">&nbsp;<strong>It&rsquo;s different</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">A search system is an easily copied model, which is why Justdial has introduced several new features to stay different: all businesses listed with Justdial can upload images, videos and brochures of what they offer in the search results page; reviews and ratings allow users to submit feedback on the website; and with Tag-Your-Friend, users recommend their reviews to family and friends. According to alexa, the Justdial site is No.40 among the top websites in India and is the top site in its category. Its dominance is obvious from the fact that total searches showed a 45.7% CAGR over FY09-12. In FY13, there was a 208% increase in mobile internet visits, from 13.6 million in FY12 to 41.9 million. The total 364 million search requests (a 43% <br /> hike from FY12) included 182.6 million internet searches, a 47% growth over FY12.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But there are some fundamental business risks as well. The large database needs to be constantly updated. And while Justdial has constantly evolved with technology, past performance &mdash; as the saying goes &mdash; is no guarantee of future success. A sudden shift in technology could well make the business obsolete. As Shah says in his report, &ldquo;Competition from MNCs such as Google poses the single biggest challenge to Justdial. Google for its next leg of growth may plan to develop local search platforms and earn from local companies. Any such move by Google is a key monitorable, given its technology competence and capital availability.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Mani disagrees. &ldquo;Google complements the entire internet &mdash; they are internet search specialists and we will see Justdial results also showing up on Google. They are not rivals unless they get into specific local search verticals,&rdquo; he says. Besides, Justdial is looking to up the stakes in the internet search space by providing more than just contact and location details. It is working on allowing users to directly order a meal, fix an appointment with the dentist, order groceries from a store or book a taxi through its website. Also on the anvil is a plan to allow users to buy or sell directly from its website, starting with cars &mdash; the company is developing a listings web page where users can review different models, sell used cars and receive price quotes for new vehicles. A &ldquo;quick quotes&rdquo; option will allow users to receive quotes from multiple vendors. And it is developing a multiple-platform downloadable mobile application that will offer all these different services. Justdial developed an application, Master App, for Android devices and iPhones in April 2013 and is in the process of developing it as an application for Blackberry and Windows Phone 7.</p>\n<p class="p3">But there&rsquo;s a big challenge with the internet platform. In voice, every enquiry from a potential customer is shared along with his contact numbers across three to five paid listings; with the net, the user may check, if at all, with one of the listings. Hence, every enquiry may not lead to potential business for more paid listings. Though the company has tried to address this issue by asking for contact details on the web, users may not fill in their details. &ldquo;Thus, the internet platform usage may impact the lead generation for paid listings, which may impact JD&rsquo;s growth,&rdquo; says the Emkay report.</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s not all. Justdial also faces regulatory concerns, with the DoT and TRAI having enforced the do-not-disturb list practice, preventing users from directly connecting with the service provider. Any further regulations to do so or regulate the online classified space will inhibit the company&rsquo;s ability to monetise its listings and squeeze realisations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Hotline to growth - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Of course, there are several positives as well. The company&rsquo;s topline has grown at a CAGR of 30% over the past five years <em>(see: Hotline to growth)</em>, with PAT growing at a CAGR of 106% over the same period. Its Ebitda margins, too, have expanded from under 5% in FY08 to 28% for FY13. So clearly, there is high operating leverage in business, wherein PAT growth is at a much higher rate than topline. Between FY12 and FY15, topline is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15%, driven by an increase in paid advertisers to 356,000 by FY15. Increased internet penetration would also mean that its operations margins would expand to 31% in FY15.&nbsp; Also, Justdial collects advance cash payment from its advertisers and is debt-free. It has a negative working capital cycle of 154 days. Being an asset-light business model over FY13-15, it is expected to generate free cash flows to the tune of Rs 440 crore.

This was his wife Fiona&rsquo;s retirement gift to him three years ago. &ldquo;Her message was clear: &lsquo;Just because you will be around all the time now, does not mean you can fiddle around with things&rsquo;,&rdquo; he recalls. When Miranda resigned from his CEO position at IDFC Private Equity, the idea was to take time off from his relentless schedule and spend time with family.</p>\n<p class="p3">Not long after he gave up his business suit, Miranda was climbing South Africa&rsquo;s tallest mountain, Mt Kilimanjaro, with son Khashiff, who had just turned 13. &ldquo;I had told my children that they can go wherever they want with any one of their parents when they turn 13,&rdquo; he explains. Being the energetic person the 51-year-old Miranda is, he intended to do more than go on treks with his family and take afternoon naps. &ldquo;Every day is different now, but I needed to do something I couldn&rsquo;t while working full-time.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Miranda turned to philanthropy, and is now associated with many non-profit organisations related to education. &ldquo;With the time I have and business network I&rsquo;ve developed, I have been able to help these organisations,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I wanted to start my own organisation, but then I realised there are already many people doing a good job. I decided to join them,&rdquo; says Miranda, who works with leading names such as Akanksha (which helps educate underprivileged children), Sneha (Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action), Dasra, Jeevika (involved with rights of street vendors) and Samhita, which does advisory work on CSR and was set up by Infosys co-founder NS Raghavan.</p>\n<p class="p3">To begin with, Miranda was able to convince corporate firms where he had worked before to fund these non-profits. Now, there are days when he spends his mornings discussing human rights, afternoons pondering over education and evenings dedicated to CSR, though not necessarily in that order. &ldquo;Sometimes, I get confused about which group I&rsquo;m talking to between conversations,&rdquo; laughs Miranda, whose conviction towards philanthropy is also supported by his family. &ldquo;After I quit my job, I got a tattoo on my arm of the sun with my wife&rsquo;s initials in it. This didn&rsquo;t make her happy. Then I volunteered to work with the organisations she was associated with, and she was happy,&rdquo; he smiles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">These days, even holidays with the family turn into philanthropic work trips. Recently, Miranda went for a holiday to Ladakh, Bhutan, Kolkata and other tourist spots with his wife and two children. They ended up teaching finance to village students in association with the 17,000 ft Foundation, an NGO that works to improve education in Ladakh&rsquo;s remotest schools.</p>\n<p class="p3">Miranda, who is also on the board of St Xavier&rsquo;s College in Mumbai and co-chairs the global advisory board of the University of Chicago&rsquo;s Booth School of Business, says there is hunger to learn within the country, but limited funds and resources make the task difficult. &ldquo;Schools in remote areas of Leh, for instance, are English-medium but the teachers do not understand the language themselves.

As the father of a young child, negotiation is something I have to do at home as well, especially if I have to get my daughter to eat her vegetables. My approach to negotiations so far was a rational one, based on facts, and the attempt would always be to arrive at a &lsquo;win-win&rsquo; situation for both sides. Most often it worked, sometimes it didn&rsquo;t. <em>Getting More: How to Negotiate to Achieve Your Goals in the Real World</em> by Stuart Diamond, was an eye-opener.</p>\n<p class="p3">Diamond is a Pulitzer-winning journalist for <em>The New York Times</em>, a Harvard-trained attorney, Wharton MBA, UN consultant and has served as manager and executive in many sectors. Currently, he teaches a course on negotiation at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. This book draws upon his vast experience and has several case studies drawn from the work of over 400 of his students. The book&rsquo;s fundamental premise is that negotiation is at the heart of human interaction. One can&rsquo;t get away from it, one can only choose to do it well or badly.</p>\n<p class="p3">In his view, there is no difference between negotiation and persuasion, communication and selling. All four fields are based on achieving goals, are focused on people, and can be situational. All four share the fundamental aim of negotiation, &ldquo;to meet your goals,&rdquo; says Diamond.</p>\n<p class="p3">The author says that since the people involved make up 90% of a negotiation &mdash; substance accounting for only 10% &mdash; one must negotiate based on one&rsquo;s understanding of the &ldquo;pictures in the head of the other party&rdquo;. He tries to underscore that psychology trumps the issues at the bargaining table. Successful negotiators must learn what makes others tick (through research, observation and small talk), take small steps, communicate clearly, avoid deceit and embrace differences. Above all, he says, they must stay focused on specific goals and connect with the other party.</p>\n<p class="p3">The book challenges conventional wisdom on every page, from &lsquo;win-win&rsquo; to the best alternative approach to the idea of a negotiated agreement. In doing so, he forces readers to think and examine their presumptions and predispositions. Diamond uses over 400 testimonials to showcase how this approach works &mdash; ranging from getting a fat discount on an item on sale, earning millions of dollars in profit to an Indian woman getting out of an arranged marriage. These case studies are extremely illustrative. The reader will find the book thought-provoking and useful in a wide variety of situations, from getting a job, getting a raise to closing business deals.</p>\n<p class="p3">How has reading this book benefited me?

A study by <strong>Natalie Mizik</strong>, <strong>Jonathan Knowles</strong> and <strong>Isaac M Dinner</strong> says that the choice of corporate branding after a merger is very important as it can help secure the loyalty of employees, customers and investors. Analysing data from 216 large mergers, the researchers said that three branding trends emerge &mdash; where one company&rsquo;s identity was discarded, where both firms operated under their own identities, and where both their identities were amalgamated to create a new brand.

A couple of months ago, Matrix Partners&rsquo; put in Rs 22 crore in water purifications solutions provider Waterlife India. And in June, Capvent picked up a 51% stake in Chennai-based water engineering company Morf India.</p>\n<p class="p3">Given India&rsquo;s population and issues relating to hygiene, health and sanitation, the interest in the sector is understandable. But, within the sector, it is water purifiers that are investors&rsquo; favourites thanks to their high retail potential. Mahesh Gupta, chairman, Kent RO Systems, which has a 40% share of the water purifiers market, says the big opportunity is on the back of worsening quality of water with dissolved impurities. &ldquo;This has serious health hazards and has increased the demand for water purifiers,&rdquo; he thinks.</p>\n<p class="p3">Which also explains why Swiss PE Capvent invested a reported #10-12 crore in a small Chennai company such as Morf. Last year, the company entered into a five-year licensing deal with Electrolux to make and sell its Kelvinator brand of water purifiers in India and Sri Lanka. (The Swedish multinational also has a deal with Kent RO to sell its premium water purifiers.) Morf India MD MV Praveen expects the water purifiers category to double in size in the next few years from the current Rs 3,800 crore to about Rs 7,000 crore. &ldquo;The opportunity here is that there are only a handful of brands in the growing market,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Already, the numbers seem to be playing out, with margins at overall Ebitda level around 14%. From #10 crore in FY13, revenue is expected to hit Rs 42 crore this year, 70% of it coming from consumer-related business, up from 60% now &mdash; Morf aims to sell 30,000 units of Kelvinator Ayoni this year, up from 5,600 in FY13. The plan now is to be present in every price segment, from Rs 1,200 to Rs 16,000 (Electrolux reigns above that price point). South India, where Morf operates, is dominated by three brands &mdash; market leader Eureka Forbes, Kent RO and Hindustan Unilever&rsquo;s Swach. The unorganised segment, though, accounts for about 30% of the market and that is where Morf hopes to find customers.

Inside, it&rsquo;s tidy and smells fresh, with uniformed personnel bustling about, pulling out evenly cut sticks of chilled, skin-scraped sugarcane from glass-door refrigerators, pushing them through imported machines, and serving up beer-mugs full of frothing cane juice within a minute.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Started in 2007 by the Kakinada-based Mayura Group, which has been running a small clutch of fast food restaurants and bakeries in Bengaluru for four decades, Cane-O-La was soon joined by many others &mdash; Cane Crush, Real Cane and Cane Fresh. But while the first two downed shutters pretty soon, the last has survived and grown into a much larger multi-city chain. Launched in 2008 with three counters in Bengaluru and Karur in Tamil Nadu, Cane Fresh quickly expanded to Mysore, Mangalore, Hosur, Dharmapuri, Anantapur, Bellary and more recently, Pune.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Cane-O-La - Element</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Both companies are tasting sweet success. Cane-O-La has 16 outlets currently of which 12 are franchisee-managed. Cane Fresh, on the other hand, has 69 outlets, of which 38 are company owned in corporate and educational campuses in corporate and educational campuses with revenue share arrangements. Both companies serve between 200 and 1,000 glasses of juice at each counter (depending on its size and location) every day during the peak season and about half that during the monsoon and winter months. Back of the envelope calculations suggest that at Rs 15 a glass, a busy counter serving 500 glasses a day in peak season could generate over Rs 20 lakh in annual sales. Mayura Group founder G Srinivasa Rao claims Cane-O-La&rsquo;s turnover, including franchises, is close to Rs 4 crore a year; turnover is only Rs 50-60 lakh at the holding company&rsquo;s level. R Swaroop, managing director, Shri Cane Fresh Beverages, says his company-owned outlets bring in about Rs 2.5 crore a year. It sounds deliciously tempting, but there are some bitter realities to the sugarcane juice business. &ldquo;The front end is easy. It&rsquo;s the back-end that&rsquo;s the real challenge,&rdquo; agrees Swaroop.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>A tight squeeze</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Certainly, it&rsquo;s not an easy business. For starters, sugarcane juice retailers can&rsquo;t put a premium price on their offering, despite the higher hygiene and quality standards. Where street vendors sell a glass of the sweet stuff for Rs 10-12 a glass, consumers don&rsquo;t seem willing to pay more than Rs 15 for the same in an organised setting. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t add water, ice or sugar. And operating as we do, our cost of production is higher by at least Rs 2-2.50 per serving,&rdquo; says Swaroop. Margins tend to be low, hovering around 10% in high season, bolstered by high sales volumes. They dip lower than 5% in off-season, thanks to the cost pressures of the supply chain and other fixed resources, especially manpower. Rao recalls how, seven years ago, tender coconut was Rs 8 and cane juice was Rs 10 per glass. &ldquo;Now, we are at Rs 15 per glass and tender coconut costs Rs 20-25 each.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Sourcing cane remains a key challenge. &ldquo;Unlike an apple or orange, where I can go to anyone for my supplies, in the case of sugarcane it has to be sourced consistently from one place,&rdquo; he adds. This is necessary to maintain regularity of supply for its monthly requirement of 120 tonnes of cane, and also ensure the juice company gets the specific varieties it needs. For Bengaluru, these are the neighbouring perennial sugarcane belts of Mandya and Maddur in Karnataka, while cane for Pune is sourced from Rahu village nearby.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Cane Fresh - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Specific varieties are important because, unlike roadside vendors, both Cane Fresh and Cane-O-La are looking at more than just sweetness in the juice they sell. Cane Fresh prefers using sugarcane that is less than 11 months old, which, says Swaroop, ensures a low glycemic index and high sucrose levels &mdash; the health benefits of such juice are prominently displayed at all Cane Fresh outlets. Cane-O-La&rsquo;s Rao, meanwhile, sought help from the Sugarcane Breeding Institute in Coimbatore to identify a special breed of the perennial grass called &lsquo;62175&rsquo;, which has less than 12% sucrose content. &ldquo;Th<span class="s1">is breed is costlier compared with other breeds,&rdquo; he says.</span></p>\n<p class="p3">Getting farmers to commit to supplies, though, is a problem, since they usually already have ongoing arrangements with jaggery factories and sugar mills that, despite payment and other issues, have been their primary source of income. &ldquo;To hold an agreement with a farmer is one of the most challenging tasks in this country,&rdquo; says Swaroop. It&rsquo;s tougher during festival peaks such as Diwali, when sugar mills need more supplies. Cane Fresh&rsquo;s solution: paying roughly Rs 200 more than the benchmark price set by the government; moreover, its sourcing contracts with farmers ensure that price increases are pegged at 10-15% annually, helping the company maintain its operational costs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But with sugarcane prices rising each year, maintaining consumer pricing for juice has understandably been difficult. Cane-O-La, for instance, held on to its price of Rs 10 per 280 ml mug of its juice till January this year, before hiking it to Rs 15. &ldquo;When we started, sugarcane was selling at Rs 800 per tonne, now it&rsquo;s cruising at close to Rs 3,000 per tonne in Mandya,&rdquo; says Rao. Cane Fresh recently revised its per serving price to Rs 20.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Both companies have relatively similar operation models. Cane Fresh&rsquo;s outlets range from 70 sq ft for takeaway counters to 120 sq ft and above for walk-in outlets that can generate up to 1,000 servings a day. Accordingly, the investment required ranges from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 7 lakh. &ldquo;The breakeven for 200 juices-a-day outlets will be close to one year payback of investment,&rdquo; says Swaroop. Cane-O-La&rsquo;s kiosks, on the other hand, measure 100 sq ft while standalone outlets need 300 sq ft. Machinery and other investment, brought in by the company, requires close to #5 lakh, while the rest of the expense of setting up an outlet depends on the location and the cost of space and is borne by the franchisee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">More importantly, the sugarcane juice business needs to be run like a tight ship, with logistics that could be as demanding as a full-scale corporate supply chain. Cane juice must reach customers within 24 hours after the stalk is peeled. What&rsquo;s more, only 60% of the juice must be extracted from the cane in its first crush for the most beneficial health benefits. To ensure this, Cane-O-La extracts juice only once. The pulp is transported back to the villages to serve as fuel for jaggery kilns. Cane-O-La requires around 90 tonnes of sugarcane every month.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Do it sweet&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">&ldquo;The problem to my mind is that sugarcane juice is a niche segment and has limited appeal,&rdquo; explains Sridhar Ramanujam, CEO of Brand-Comm, a Bengaluru-based brand consultancy. &ldquo;Throw in problems such as higher transportation costs etc., and the only way forward to getting premium prices is by building a brand,&rdquo; he adds. He adds that very little of that has been done so far. Rao appears to have got the first step right by coining a clever and contemporary name for his product. &ldquo;We named it Cane-O-La to compete with Pepsi Cola and Coca Cola because we want to appeal to young people who can make the more healthy choice with fresh sugarcane juice instead of aerated drinks,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Sugarcane juice is a niche segment and has limited appeal. The only way to get premium prices is by building a brand" - Sridhar Ramanujam, CEO, Brand-Comm</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">What Cane-O-La or Cane Fresh possibly cannot match, is the deep distribution muscle of aerated drink manufacturers. Expansion is stymied by transportation costs, and being located close to a cane growing region is crucial to the business model. Cane-O-La has limited itself to Bengaluru with one outlet in Andhra Pradesh&rsquo;s Kadapa, Rao&rsquo;s home town.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There are operational issues to contend with, as well. The harvested cane has to be promptly peeled, cut, stored and transported at temperatures of 6-9 degrees Celsius to retain its freshness and juice content. Peeling cane is a labour-intensive job and till such time the peeling process is mechanised, it&rsquo;s best done at the harvest point, that is, the villages where it&rsquo;s grown. Cane Fresh, for instance, has a &ldquo;rural preparatory team&rdquo; for this. Located in Mandya, the 2,000 sq ft facility has around 30 people engaged in cleaning and peeling the freshly harvested stems. The peeled sugarcane is packed into ventilated crates and loaded on to one of seven refrigerated trucks that travel to its city outlets. Some of this goes to its four cold storage facilities in Bengaluru, Mangalore and Moodabidri (which services the Alvas College of Engineering campus), where half to one day of peeled cane inventory is stored.</p>\n<p class="p3">Now, the company is trying to speed up the process by developing an indigenous mechanical peeler. There&rsquo;s a precedent here: Cane Fresh already developed a crusher in-house. Modern generation crushers are generally from China but the company didn&rsquo;t find them suitable for Indian conditions. &ldquo;They could not withstand Indian varieties of sugarcane, which are very thick and strong compared with other countries,&rdquo; says Swaroop. Even the joints on a cane stem are so thick that they used to damage the rollers and cause the shaft to break down in the Chinese crushers. It took more than two years, and many rounds of experimentation, for Cane Fresh to finally come up with a &ldquo;re-engineered&rdquo; and faster contraption in 2010. Now, Swaroop claims his are among the fastest crushers in the market. &ldquo;Conventional crushers can give two servings a minute. We manage six to eight juices a minute with our crusher,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">This can make an important difference during peak hours such as lunchtime in corporate campuses and weekends in retail food courts, when customers descend on the outlets in droves. Six of Cane-O-La&rsquo;s 16 outlets are in corporate office complexes, including one in the Infosys campus, and five as kiosks in malls. Similarly, some of Cane Fresh&rsquo;s better performing locations include the TCS campus in Pune, BTM Layout and TCS and ITPL in Bengaluru. &ldquo;Generally, locations that can attract families do better and so we normally choose food courts or standalone canteens,&rdquo; says Swaroop.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In such locations Cane Fresh works on revenue share arrangements with food court contractors. Here, revenues tend to be higher than in corporate and educational campuses that operate only five days a week or roughly 22 days a month. Another issue with corporate food courts outlets is the seasonality of a different kind where IT companies hire large swathes of workers for specific projects. Swaroop points out: &ldquo;Once a project is over, 400-500 employees are shifted to another campus.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Stretch targets</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Even if their business models are strikingly similar, both companies have very different growth plans. Cane-O-La&rsquo;s focus right now is on consolidating its presence in Bengaluru and offering customers reasons to spend more in its outlets. So, it also sells snacks such as <em>chikki</em> from Lonavla and has introduced popcorn machines at a couple of stores. As an experiment, the company is also selling organic jaggery at its outlets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Swaroop at Cane Fresh, though, is concentrating on selling more juice at more locations &mdash; in the next year alone, he plans to add 10 outlets between Bengaluru and Pune. He&rsquo;s also banking on developing the in-house peeler in the next year. &ldquo;That will give us limitless capability. We&rsquo;ll be able to cut degeneration by five or six hours,&rdquo; he says. It could even help kickstart his ambitious plan to replicate the model overseas, beginning with Singapore, where, he says, &ldquo;the value realisation will be 10 times more&rdquo;.</p>\n<p class="p3">Packaging sugarcane juice for retail consumption, though, is not on the agenda, since that will defeat its health benefits and could take away the freshness appeal. &ldquo;Cane juice is a functional food, not a fun food,&rdquo; Swaroop says. Packaging of cane juice is an idea that&rsquo;s not yet been successfully done in India, confirms Ajay Gupta, CEO at New Delhi-based NIIR Project Consultancy Services. &ldquo;But it is possible without adding preservatives and the taste more or less remains the same,&rdquo; he points out. &ldquo;We have done lab-level production and preservation of cane juice.&rdquo; Gupta adds that the high cost for setting up an aseptic packaging unit &mdash; around #3 crore &mdash; could possibly be a deterrent. Swaroop estimates that India has a potential for over 1 million outlets in the improved and organised format that he and his contemporaries have attempted to create. If only consumers were ready to pay more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>&mdash;With inputs from Lalitha Sridhar</strong></p>', 'Sugarcane juice hasn''t been an easy business to organise.

(388, 12, '', 'Full cream ahead', '<p class="p1">It is dark and damp at 6 pm in Malwada, about 85 km from Mumbai. This is small-town Maharashtra and the power shortage is a sad reality that residents have learnt to live with. The healthy monsoon, while bringing some relief after a torrid summer, also means there is little sunlight after 5 pm. Jagannath Chaudhary, a 62-year-old farmer, gets off his Honda Pleasure scooter and makes his way into a new facility that Amul has set up in a small room of about 400 sq ft. The rapid milk chiller (RMC) installed in July this year is worth the 5 km ride for Chaudhary every morning and evening. Five of his seven buffaloes back home are productive, giving approximately 40 litres, which Chaudhary brings to the Malwada centre every day, after keeping aside two litres for his family.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The price he gets per litre depends on the milk&rsquo;s fat content. This evening it&rsquo;s 6.3%, which means he has made Rs 700. The milk in Malwada comes almost entirely from buffaloes, and the fat content is greater leading to better prices. (The range today is Rs 30 per litre going up to Rs 38, though the hope is with more fat, it could touch Rs 50). &ldquo;This facility has helped us in preserving the freshness of the milk. In the past, if nobody bought the milk, it would get spoilt in four hours,&rdquo; he says. The RMC, created by Promethean Spenta Technologies, ensures milk remains fresh for at least 24 hours in the absence of power. As a result, folks like Chaudhary are assured of a fair price for their milk and they do not have to worry about unsold milk getting spoiled.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>A cool concept</strong></p>\n<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sam White and Sorin Grama founded Promethean Power Sys</span><span class="s2">tems in the US in 2007, after their idea placed second at an MIT business plan competition for a solar-powered turbine project. White, who was working for a startup, soon quit his job to set up the new venture with Grama, then fresh out of MIT. They were inspired after hearing Harish Hande, the founder of Selco, an organisation that is working to eradicate poverty through sustainable technologies, speak at MIT on the micro-finance infrastructure in India. Exploring further about India, they discovered that at least 13 billion kg agricultural produce was wasted each year owing to a poorly developed supply chain. &ldquo;This was a huge business opportunity. In our own minds, we realised that the more successful we were, the greater the social impact,&rdquo; says White.</span></p>\n<p class="p7">In November, while visiting India, a conversation with senior executives at a dairy in Bengaluru revealed the practical difficulties of transporting milk in rural India. Milk was collected twice a day from a large number of villages, and it had to be chilled in four hours to prevent spoilage. Most states (except Gujarat) face severe power shortages, and diesel generators kept the chillers running at collection centres. This meant that costs were high, making the complete proposition uneconomical.</p>\n<p class="p7">With the $10,000 they had won at MIT, Grama and White went about developing a thermal battery that could power the chillers more economically in the event of the power failure, thereby addressing the issue of power outage in remote locations. &ldquo;We had to create something that worked well in the Indian context,&rdquo; says White.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7">In September 2011, Villgro Innovations Foundation, a social enterprise incubator, invested in Promethean by way of a technical services fee. Its founder and CEO Paul Basil explains that the trigger was the fact that milk being a perishable commodity, large quantities were being wasted in its collection and storage in rural areas. &ldquo;Besides, many farmers are left out of the organised supply chain as they are located away from the optimised milk collection route. Micro and decentralised chilling has been spoken about, but has not taken shape,&rdquo; he points out.</p>\n<p class="p9"><strong>Ready to milk</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">After several iterations over four years that included a solar powered chiller, the duo came up with the final prototype in 2013. Once the milk is weighed, it is poured into an RMC, which can store up to 50 litres. Here, the temperature drops from 35 degrees to 3 degrees in a couple of minutes. It&rsquo;s then transferred to a silo, which can store 1,000 litres at a time for approximately 48 hours without spoilage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7">In 2012, Promethean (after Prometheus, the Greek mythological hero who represents the quest for scientific knowledge) teamed up, through a common contact, with Rustom Irani of Mumbai-based Spenta Refrigeration, whose family has been in the manufacturing of packaged ice. With Irani as CEO, Promethean Spenta, which began with an initial investment of Rs 3 crore, has sold 60 RMCs so far to private dairies such as Prabhat Dairy and Heritage Foods, apart from Amul. Its biggest client, accounting for 50 chillers purchased, is Chennai-based Hatsun Agro Product. Dairy cooperatives will be the next focus area, he adds. The complete RMC equipment with the thermal battery comes at a price tag Rs 4.5 lakh without the 1,000 litre silo; with the silo it costs Rs 5.5 lakh. &ldquo;We are developing a 2,000 litre model, which should be ready in about six months,&rdquo; says Irani, adding that the company currently works on gross margins of 10-15%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7">For customers, the savings from the RMC are significant when compared with a more conventional bulk milk chiller (BMC), which comes for around Rs 14 lakh with accessories such as a diesel generator and piping. Using the RMC means there is no central chilling centre since it is housed in the collection centre. Moreover, the RMC requires only single-phase power and remains unaffected by rising diesel costs. &ldquo;The typical operating costs are at least 40% lower for the RMC at Rs 0.5 per litre. The annual savings works out to Rs 3.4 lakh with a payback of 2.5 years,&rdquo; says Irani.</p>\n<p class="p7">While Promethean makes the thermal battery, it works with suppliers who manufacture the other components of the system. Each unit is made to order with 10-15 chillers being produced each month. Installation and trials take two days and the RMCs come with a one-year warranty. &ldquo;Our target is to sell 200 units during the current fiscal and 400 units in FY15,&rdquo; says Irani. Hatsun will continue to be a key customer and is expected to buy another 200 units. RG Chandramogan, chairman, Hatsun Agro, says the concept of instant chilling helps enhance the quality of milk. &ldquo;The instant chiller removes the role of a genset and that is an investment saving,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p8">&nbsp;<strong>Unlocking value</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">At Malwada, about 300 litres of milk is sold every day with collection taking place in the morning and evening. There is no limit on how much milk can be sold here and the residents are comfortable about getting a somewhat lower price. &ldquo;Normally, there is a middleman who says he represents a private dairy. He gives us Rs 38 per litre irrespective of fat content and there is no guarantee on the weights and measures used,&rdquo; explains Rameshwar Patil, who has just brought in 9.5 litres, which will fetch him Rs 30.52 per litre. He is quick to point out that a fat content of 14% could give us much as Rs 50 per litre. &ldquo;A transparent process makes us more comfortable,&rdquo; he says. On a good day, a farmer here can make a profit of about Rs 7 per lire of milk.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7">For Amul, working at the village level is not anything new. Just in the Anand and Kheda districts, says Amul Dairy&rsquo;s managing director Rahul Kumar, there are as many as 1,200 village-level societies. But in places where power is constantly available, this system will be expensive in comparison. &ldquo;The RMC is not effective in Gujarat since there is no issue with power. But we have gone ahead with it in Maharashtra and West Bengal,&rdquo; he says. Amul now plans to have another five in Maharashtra apart from the one in Malwada. &ldquo;Our objective is that the RMC should be close to the plant. The big social benefit will be that farmers will be encouraged to produce more milk,&rdquo; says Kumar, calling this the multiplier effect in the milk collection and supply chain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7">According to the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), total milk production in India in FY12 was 127.90 million tonnes. The corresponding number for the previous year was 121.84 million tonnes up from 116.42 million tonnes in FY10. It is estimated that private dairies account for 55% of the total production with the rest coming from cooperative dairies. Uttar Pradesh is the largest followed by Rajasthan and Punjab. The opportunity for Promethean is huge, but then it comes from states that not only produce a lot of milk but also have towns such as Malwada that grapple in the dark.&nbsp;</p>', 'Promethean''s innovative battery-driven milk chillers is a win-win proposition for dairy owners and farmers', '7', '', 0, '', 'full-cream-ahead-388', 382, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Full cream ahead ', 'Promethean''s innovative battery-driven milk chillers is a win-win proposition for dairy owners and farmers', '', '', '', 'Rapid milk chiller,Promethean Spenta Technologies,Milk,Dairy co-operatives', 0, NULL, '2015-02-02 17:14:53', '2015-02-02 17:24:51', '2013-08-17', 0),
(389, 16, '', 'The bright spot', '<p class="p1">S&nbsp;Raghunandan quit his comfy job as the country head of the UK-based consumer major Reckitt Benckiser in January 2012 to join as CEO of the home-grown Jyothy Laboratories a few months later. What made him go for the switch was the wider role being offered in his new assignment, unlike what he had been doing at Reckitt. A year later, Raghunandan is happy to have made that decision and that has largely to do with the performance he managed to dish out at Jyothy, widely known for its Ujala whitener brand.</p>\n<p class="p2">To begin with, Jyothy never had a professional management in place and was largely run by the founder-promoter, MP Ramachandran, and joint managing director, Ullas Kamath. When Ramachandran roped in Raghunandan, the brief was very clear that he had to ensure a successful integration of loss-making Henkel, which the company had acquired last year, and that the new entity had to achieve revenues of Rs 3,000 crore by 2015.</p>\n<p class="p2">So far, Raghunandan seems to be on the right track. After taking over, the CEO put in place a clear business strategy by appointing business heads, streamlining the firm&rsquo;s supply chain, revamping brands and making the case for higher advertising spend.</p>\n<p class="p2">For the first time in 30 years, the company opted for a makeover of its Rs 330-crore flagship brand, Ujala Supreme, in April this year. Jyothy revamped Ujala with new packaging and increased its price (a 75-ml bottle is now available for Rs 17, up Rs 2) to counter rival Hindustan Unilever, which had forayed into the fabric blue space with Rin and also launched liquid detergent under Surf Excel. Ujala is the market leader with 75% share of the Rs 440-crore fabric blue market, while Reckitt Benckiser&rsquo;s Robin Blue has 3.5% and HUL 2%. The revamp was accompanied by a new TV commercial, which changed the tagline from &ldquo;<em>Chaar boondon wala</em>&rdquo; to &ldquo;<em>Safedi ke aage Ujala</em>&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Paying off</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">After the new packaging and aggressive marketing, Ujala&rsquo;s sales shot up by 37% in Q1FY14 (25% value growth and 10% volume growth). As a result, the overall contribution of the flagship brand&rsquo;s portfolio increased from 16% in first quarter of last year to 20% in the first quarter of this year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp; Under the Ujala umbrella are other brands such as Ujala Supreme, Ujala Washing Powder, Stiff and Shine, Ujala Techno Bright and a newly-launched premium detergent, Ujala IBF 100. In fact, Ujala IBF 100 is priced at Rs 85/kg against Rs 92 for Procter &amp; Gamble&rsquo;s Tide and Hindustan Unilever&rsquo;s Rin Advanced at Rs 76. Besides, the company, which has two businesses (soaps-detergents and home care), is now focusing on seven power brands &mdash; Ujala, Henko, Pril, Margo, Fa, Maxo and Exo.</p>\n<p class="p2">Analysts believe the revamp is paying off. Tejashwini Kumari, an analyst from Angel Broking, says, &ldquo;Ujala&rsquo;s new branding has ensured a direct reach to the masses, which will be a major advantage for them. Besides, the launch of IBF 100 in the south will definitely benefit the company.&rdquo; Going ahead, plans are afoot to relaunch Fa soap along with a premium liquid whitener.</p>\n<p class="p2">Besides revamping the portfolio, the management also decided to cut distributor margins from 8% to 6% on all 10 brands; the company has around 1,700 distributors, 200 super stockists and over 2,000 sub-stockists. Similarly, retailers&rsquo; margins were revised from Rs 10-15 earlier to Rs 10. However, analysts see a downside to this move. &ldquo;We believe Jyothy Laboratories would be unable to sustain revenue growth with low channel partner margins,&rdquo; analysts Sanjay Manyal and Parineeta Poddar of ICICI Securities mentioned in a recent report. Raghunandan, though, counters this. &ldquo;We were earlier giving very high margins but even at current levels we are offering much more than industry level. So, why will retailers not push our products?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Further, streamlining the supply chain, the new CEO also consolidated manufacturing by shutting down plants in Bhubaneswar and Chennai and shifting production to Uttaranchal and Puducherry.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Raising the pitch</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">More importantly, the company ramped up its advertising and marketing budgets. Ad spend as percentage of sales increased from 8.1% in Q1FY13 to 12% in Q1FY14. For now, the higher spend has resulted in commensurate growth in sales (<em>see: Showtime</em>). &ldquo;We are committing ourselves to spend as much as the industry spends on advertising and promotions as we believe this will fetch us higher returns,&rdquo; says Raghunandan.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Showtime - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">In FY13, Jyothy Laboratories recorded a 53% growth in revenues to Rs 1,017 crore, but net profit fell to Rs 44 crore owing to the merger of loss-making Henkel and brief absence of Ujala from stores shelves as the company went into a redesign mode. But in Q1 of FY14, sales were up 13% y-o-y, while profits bounced back over 100% to Rs 29 crore. Analysts believe the momentum is in favour of the company. Aashish Upganlawar of Elara Securities believes that brands such as Henko, Ujala powder, Margo, Fa and Pril have market share (low single digits) and absolute sales far below their brand equity. &ldquo;Management&rsquo;s efforts on branding/distribution promise substantial growth over coming years,&rdquo; states Upganlawar in a report.</p>\n<p class="p2">Jyothy&rsquo;s joint MD, Ullas Kamath, can&rsquo;t help gush over the Q1 performance, &ldquo;Bottomline improvement has come because of distribution changes, increase in prices and the product mix. Thanks to the new management team, it has paid off.&rdquo; Now, Raghunandan and co are eyeing 25% increase in topline for FY14 and maintaining operating margins at 15%.

(390, 16, '', 'The dark hour', '<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Y</span>ou could be excused for thinking B Prasada Rao heads a railway equipment manufacturing company. As we settle into our meeting, bolstered by steaming cups of filter coffee, he delves deep into the technologies that go into making different types of rail locomotives. The talk then shifts to a Rs 1,000 crore investment in a greenfield facility at Bhilwara, Rajasthan, to make electrical multiple units (EMUs) and then to the opportunities in the urban metro rail market. All very interesting, but we are in the office of the chairman and managing director of Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL) and <span class="s2">what is conspicuous by its absence in Rao&rsquo;s conversation is a discussion on power equipment, the Rs 50,015-crore public sector undertaking&rsquo;s mainstay.</span></p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s a telling omission. BHEL is India&rsquo;s largest power equipment manufacturer, with a 57% share in total installed generating capacity contributing 69% to the total power generated; at Rs 39,577 crore in FY13, the power business accounted for nearly 80% of the <em>maharatna</em>&rsquo;s turnover. But now, there are plans to change that. In the next four-five years, BHEL wants to increase the share of non-core business from the current 20% to 30% of revenue and by FY22, that is, the next eight years, wants to take it to as much as 50%. The contribution of the locomotive sector, says Rao, will then increase &ldquo;from the current 4-5% to 10% of turnover&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a dramatic change and one driven as much by the declining prospects in BHEL&rsquo;s bread-and-butter business as by growing opportunities in the non-power space. How does the public sector behemoth plan to go about this shift and, more importantly, will it work?</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Powerless</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">First, though, a little background on what&rsquo;s been happening in the power business. From its inception in 1964 till the mid-2000s, BHEL enjoyed a virtual monopoly in a highly profitable business, supplying power equipment to state and central power utilities. In FY13, though, for the first time in 11 years, the PSU posted a 6% drop in profit after tax and stated it would miss its FY17 revenue target of Rs 1 lakh crore. And in Q1FY14, it posted net profit of Rs 465.43 crore, nearly 50% lower than the Rs 920.90 crore in Q1FY13.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But, truth be told, the business started losing power much earlier. When Rao came on board in October 2009, BHEL was looking set to close FY09 with a record 44,000 MW of orders. By the next year, though, the order book dipped to 40,000 MW. The influx of Chinese power equipment manufacturers over the previous half-decade or so was making its presence felt. The Chinese companies had three pluses in their favour: they were cheaper for the buyers, they delivered on time and they also offered vendor credit at very low rates. As companies such as Lanco, Adani Power, Reliance Power, Vedanta, JSW and even the Haryana state utilities switched loyalties, BHEL saw its market share dropping. By FY12, Chinese companies had grabbed close to 30% of the power market in India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">If that wasn&rsquo;t bad enough, a clutch of private domestic players, in partnerships with big multinational companies, have also been steadily gaining share (<em>see: Turf war</em>). &ldquo;The power sector was always complaining that the manufacturing sector was not keeping pace with it. In the past, BHEL could roll out only 5,000 MW of power sets every year. It raised its capacity to 7,000 MW in 2007 and to 20,000 MW in 2012. But even that was not enough,&rdquo; says RV Shahi, former power secretary. A recent report by Citi Research points out that &ldquo;over the last five to six years, BHEL faced stiff competition from Chinese suppliers. The problem has been compounded by the rise of domestic equipment suppliers like L&amp;T-MHI (Mitsubishi), Toshiba-JSW, Bharat Forge-Alstom, BGR-Hitachi, Doosan, Thermax-Babcock Wilcox, Cethar Vessels and GB Engineering Ansaldo.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Turf war - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The impact: additions to the order book have dropped steadily from FY09, from 17,020 MW that year to a low of 2,820 MW in FY12; the slight upswing last year, to 7,791 MW, is still nowhere close to what was garnered in earlier years (<em>see: Tripping over</em>). The government came to BHEL&rsquo;s rescue last year when it increased the import duty on power generation equipment, from 5% to 21%. With increasing murmurs about quality issues in Chinese equipment, the higher price of imported equipment means &ldquo;the Chinese aren&rsquo;t such a big threat now&rdquo;, says Rao. &ldquo;Power producers in India are now aware of the problems Chinese-produced equipment pose and two, BHEL has been able to successfully outbid Chinese vendors where there is competitive bidding.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The Chinese aren''t a big threat now. BHEL has been able to successfully outbid Chinese vendors" - B Prasada Rao, CMD, BHEL</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s because while BHEL can&rsquo;t match its Chinese rivals when it comes to price (although with the import duty and rupee depreciation, the price differential has narrowed considerably), it scores on technical parameters such as customising equipment to match clients&rsquo; needs and providing a higher output level. The PSU has also won projects from companies that have opted to stick with homegrown suppliers, such as the Jaiprakash Group and Shishir Bajaj group. Sources in the industry point out that the bid for the latter&rsquo;s 1,980 MW Lalitpur project near Jhansi (to be commissioned by 2015) deliberately didn&rsquo;t encourage Chinese bidders and the project was won by BHEL. But, the good news for BHEL&rsquo;s power sector business begins and ends there.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Three strikes and you''re out</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">It&rsquo;s not a good time to be in the power business in India. As the Citi report says, &ldquo;severe coal/gas shortages, high international coal prices, poor [state electricity utility] financials and land acquisition/environmental delays have shrunk the opportunity pie for BHEL.&rdquo; Of course, it&rsquo;s not just BHEL; Shahi points out that &ldquo;all manufacturing companies have been hit on account of a slowdown in the power sector&rdquo;. Also, points out analyst Pritesh Chheda of Emkay, current boiler turbine generator (BTG) prices have already hit a low. &ldquo;Current BTG prices are [Rs 2.3 crore]/MW. This is the ultimate panic price! Because at [Rs 2.3 crore/MW], a player such as BHEL would generate margin of 17.8% and Ebidta of barely 4-6% at full capacity utilisation. This indicates far higher trouble for the rest of the players,&rdquo; he says in a report.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>"All manufacturing companies have been hit on account of a slowdown in the power sector" - RV Shahi, former power secretary</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">But, with limited projects on offer, all power equipment manufacturers, including BHEL, will have to continue to bid more aggressively to win projects. Once the domestic private players indigenise production, they will be able to bring down costs and bid significantly lower prices for contracts. BHEL, by virtue of being a PSU, can&rsquo;t bid for projects as aggressively as its rivals, both domestic and foreign. The Navin Jindal-promoted JSPL Group&rsquo;s Godda project is a classic example. Sources say the boiler tender for the project is expected to be awarded to Thermax-Babcock Wilcox as the joint venture has the manufacturing assets on the ground, but no projects in hand. Moreover, says the source, &ldquo;the price offered [by Thermax] was at variable cost, lower than even break-even&rdquo;. Extending that logic, it is likely that the turbine contract for the same project will be bagged by the Toshiba-JSW joint venture of the Sajjan Jindal group.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s not just in India. According to Credit Suisse India Research, BHEL has also lost overseas orders worth an estimated Rs 1,200 crore in the last quarter. Chinese power generation equipment manufacturers have been awarded contracts in Sudan, Uganda and elsewhere. That&rsquo;s especially worrying in the current scenario, where a depreciating rupee should ideally have put BHEL in a competitive spot as far as exports are concerned.</p>\n<p class="p3">For his part, Rao puts up a brave front at the potential loss of such large tenders. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t bid for projects where we will have to sell our company,&rdquo; he declares. Even if you accept that reasoning, BHEL seems especially jinxed these days when it comes to projects &mdash; change in government policy has also resulted in it losing out on a couple of occasions. The EPC contract for the 1,320 MW Chhabra project in Rajasthan is a case in point. In 2011, the state government called for EPC bids for two projects &mdash; the 1,320 MW Suratgarh project and the one at Chhabra. BHEL was the lowest bidder in the initial tender. While negotiations were on to finalise the contract, the state decided to award only one contract to a company and called for retender. Again, say sources, BHEL emerged lowest in both projects. But the Chhabra project was offered to the second-lowest bidder, L&amp;T- Mitsubishi, which was asked to match BHEL&rsquo;s offer. &ldquo;We just don&rsquo;t know how to tackle this problem,&rdquo; says a vexed BHEL official. &ldquo;Such policies make it very difficult for us to bid.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Now, Andhra Pradesh, too, is believed to be toying with the idea of adopting the same policy for three 800-MW projects coming up at Krishnapatnam, Vijaywada and Rayalseema. &ldquo;Even if we bid aggressively for all three, we know we will get only one. And if we bid aggressively for one and are lax on the others, we would be subject to public scrutiny since we are a PSU,&rdquo; says the executive.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Slow and steady - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s not as if BHEL doesn&rsquo;t have enough work. At the end of Q1FY14, its outstanding order book stood at Rs 108,600 crore, which should keep it going for another five years. Trouble is, its 20,000 MW installed capacity is about five times as much as the JV companies (<em>see: Slow and steady</em>) and as fresh orders dry up, it runs the risk of capacity lying idle. Given that BHEL is struggling to get it right in its core business, what are its chances of success in non-core areas?</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Non-core to the fore</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">To be fair, non-power isn&rsquo;t a new business area for BHEL. The PSU has been present in the transportation sector for over 40 years, supplying locomotives to Indian Railways from its factory in Jhansi &mdash; 75% of all electrical equipment for the railways comes from BHEL. Certainly, there&rsquo;s no dearth of orders from the railways. BHEL is now gearing up to supply state of the art, three-phase IGBT-based propulsion systems for 1,400 horsepower AC EMUs and 6,000 hp electric locomotives &mdash; hence, the upcoming facility in Rajasthan. Analyst Renu Baid of Batliwala &amp; Karani Securities thinks the plans of expansion in the locomotive sector is a good idea since &ldquo;transportation can be the next power sector to see huge growth&rdquo;.</p>\n<p class="p3">But it&rsquo;s not quite that cut and dry. Analysts point out that in the railways, BHEL by virtue of being a PSU has been granted contracts on a nomination basis. But &ldquo;rail transportation&rdquo; also includes urban metro rail projects and here, it will face stiff competition from companies such as BEML, Bombardier, Siemens, Alstom et al. &ldquo;Once the transportation sector is opened to competition, it will offer huge business to other players as well,&rdquo; agrees Sunil Chaturvedi, COO of Bharat Forge and director of Alstom-Bharat Forge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">What makes this business especially tricky is that growth in transportation is dependent on the politically-sensitive railways ministry. And growth in metro rail is dependent on coordination between the urban development ministry and the state governments. Again, BHEL hasn&rsquo;t had too much luck here. Its strategy for this new business is partnerships, but its tie-up with Hitachi missed out when it came to bidding for the Hyderabad metro project. But Rao is convinced of the potential. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a growth opportunity here in future and we are looking to tie up with a technology partners,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">His other area of interest is an equally tricky one. In the highly competitive photovoltaic (PV) business, BHEL has plans to set up India&rsquo;s first silicon manufacturing facility in Vidarbha, Maharashtra. With contributions from the National Clean Energy Fund, it intends to set up a 500 MW PV plant, investing Rs 1,300 crore. It&rsquo;s tied up with Abengoa of Spain to set up an experimental concentrated solar power project in association with IIT Jodhpur and Indian Oil Corporation. All good on paper, but the track record of most firms in the solar energy space has been abysmal, which doesn&rsquo;t lead analysts to hold out hope for BHEL&rsquo;s venture. &ldquo;Solar potential would only be realised if we develop the green transmission corridor and ensure cost of manufacturing is low,&rdquo; says former power secretary Anil Razdan.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"There is nothing new in BHEL''s plan to push for growth in non-core areas; it has done this in the 1980s, too" - AK Puri, managing director, Hinduja National Power Corporation</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">AK Puri, MD of Hinduja National Power Corporation and former CMD of BHEL, says there is nothing new in BHEL&rsquo;s plan to push for growth in non-core areas. &ldquo;In the mid-1980s, too, it had attempted something similar,&rdquo; he recalls. But as the company&rsquo;s track record shows, that strategy did not play out. In fact, in 2000, it had even announced its intention of setting up a non-banking finance company, to bridge the gap in power financing. The idea was stillborn. Around the same time, there was the plan of forming equity partnerships with state utilities to set up large projects using supercritical technology. Except for one project in Karnataka, nothing&rsquo;s moved on that front. Will the <em>maharatna</em> achieve 50% growth from the non-power business by FY22?<span class="s3"> Rao has a good story to tell but knows he won&rsquo;t be answerable if the script goes awry &mdash; he will hang up his boots by early next year.

(392, 20, '', 'High Expectations', '<p class="p1">Jitendra Nath Gupta might not have had enough chances to haul up corporates during his stint as executive director of&nbsp; the Securities and Exchange Board of India, but he is making up for lost time by going after managements through his not-for-profit corporate governance research and advisory body, SES Corporate Governance. As part of this initiative, in February this year, SES came out with a report detailing its comments on the agenda of Gateway Distriparks&rsquo; (GDL) extraordinary general meeting on March 8.</p>\n<p class="p3">What got the goat of SES was that the management of the logistics-to-cold chain major was seeking approval to double the commission rate of Gopinath Pillai, the chairman and non-executive director (NED), from 1% to 2% of GDL&rsquo;s net profit and for other NEDs at 1% for the next five years, effective FY13. &ldquo;The resolution has inherent conflict of interest since the board of directors will be deciding their own remuneration for a period of five continuous years. Additionally, the total commissions payable to NEDs will be increased beyond the limit of 1% proposed in Section 309 of the Companies Act (provided the company receives central government approval). Each of the above is not considered a good corporate governance practice,&rdquo; stated the report.</p>\n<p class="p3">To put the hike in perspective, the report mentioned that if one were to apply the 2% commission rate for the previous five years and calculate the potential increase the resolution may result in, the commission paid over FY08-FY12 would have increased 478%, from Rs 1.20 crore to Rs 8.12 crore.</p>\n<p class="p3">More importantly, SES pointed out that Pillai, being an NED, is not involved in the day-to-day operations and the increase in remuneration was more than what is being paid to the managing director. &ldquo;The company has stated that the chairman devotes substantial time and attention to the company. However, SES is of the opinion that an NED cannot be making a more significant time contribution to the company compared with the managing director. Hence, unless the company reclassifies Pillai as an executive director, the hike in commission payable is unjustified,&rdquo; the report said. Besides, the company also didn&rsquo;t have independent committees in place to oversee remuneration payable to senior executives and executive directors and for director appointments.</p>\n<p class="p3">Expectedly, the proposals went through the EGM. &ldquo;In this country, all said and done, promoters continue to call the shots, given their substantial holdings. Our idea is not to single out any company or management but to ensure overall corporate governance standards improve so investors take cognizance and prevent good businesses from turning bad,&rdquo; says Gupta. GDL&rsquo;s management did n<span class="s1">ot participate in this story, citing the silent period in the run-up to an IPO filing.</span></p>\n<p class="p3">To be fair, the governance issue aside, the management at GDL has delivered the goods. While consolidated revenues have more than doubled over the past five years (FY09-FY13), from Rs 450 crore to Rs 950 crore, profits have surged 77%, from Rs 77 crore to Rs 136 crore (<em>see: Beating the blues</em>). The question is: if the management is seeking a bigger slice of profits in the coming five years, can investors also be assured their pound of flesh?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Interestingly, while bottomline has shown 12% CAGR over the past five years, stock returns have been tepid at 5% from Rs 98 (April 1, 2008) to Rs 125 (March 28, 2013). That&rsquo;s not surprising, given that the company&rsquo;s fortunes are intricately linked with that of the economy, which is in the doldrums. The management, however, is looking at other engines of growth beyond the core container freight stations business to focus on the rail container business and cold storage logistics vertical under Snowman, which is in the process of going public. That could also largely explain why the stock has held its ground at Rs 100 levels, despite the bloodbath on the Street.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Three-pronged</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">GDL has three distinct business divisions: the container freight services business; rail container/inland container depots, a division that engages in rail movement of containers to major maritime ports; and the cold chain and storage and logistics division, which it acquired through a 50.1% equity stake acquisition in Snowman Frozen Foods in November 2006. A container freight station (CFS) is a location for storing container cargo either <em>en route</em> to a port for shipping overseas or for cargo being imported and sent to its final destination. GDL is one of the largest CFS players in India, handling 500,000 TEU annually and its CFS division accounts for 31% of total revenues, but contributes a higher share to the bottomline at 48%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In a JV with the Punjab government, GDL had established Punjab Conware, a container terminal at Navi Mumbai. This was earlier gutted in a fire but is now back on stream and is expected to add capacity of another 60,000 TEU. In all, GDL has six CFS, including the one at JNPT, which has a cargo handling capacity of 300,000 TEU and to which a fourth terminal is being added. The company also has two CFS in Chennai, and one each in Visakhapatnam and Kochi; the last is being ramped up to 50,000 TEU.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But while the new terminals have added capacity and increased throughput, this has been offset by the slowdown in exim trade &mdash; in Q1FY14 the CFS division lost 8% y-o-y in volumes. Over-congestion in the key JNPT terminal also means that business is often lost to Mundra and Pipavav terminals. While traditionally the CFS business has been a cash cow, delivering Rs 80-90 crore of free cash flows on average in a year, of late it has been hit by severe competition from the likes of Gati and Allcargo, forcing GDL to undercut prices. Rising costs in the form of labour, transportation and sub-contracting charges haven&rsquo;t helped. The fallout of a reduction in volumes and realisation has been an 11% y-o-y drop in revenues as of Q1FY14.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Going ahead, the outlook for the CFS business is far from rosy. In a concall following the first quarter results, GDL deputy CEO R Kumar conceded, &ldquo;Obviously there is an impact on imports because bulk of our revenue comes from imports. Particularly, the capital equipment and other expansion plans of manufacturing industries are not taking off and this will have an impact on our business and profitability. If the rupee stabilises, we could see some boost to volumes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">However, analysts believe that more than the CFS business, it is the rail container business and cold chain businesses that promise the big kicker in coming years. Says a domestic fund manager who holds the stock as part of his top 10 mid-cap holdings, &ldquo;CFS is more like a fixed deposit, but the exciting part is the rail container business, which has very high entry barriers. Despite the presence of 14-odd players, after Concor, it is GDL that has the edge, given its unique model.&rdquo; Just what is so cutting-edge about the rail business?</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>On the fast track</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">GDL runs the rail container operations via a subsidiary, Gateway Rail Freight (GRFL), which owns and operates a fleet of 21 trains, the second-largest in the country after state-owned Concor, and 235 road trailers at its rail linked inland container depots (ICDs) at Garhi, Ludhiana, Kalamboli and Assauti (Faridabad). GDL entered the container rail segment in 2007 when the segment was opened up for private participation. Of the 14 private operators who applied for licences, many scaled back their operations after realising that the segment is capital intensive and has a long gestation period. GDL, however, incurred a capex of some Rs 800 crore over FY07-12 and took the pain of losses till FY11 before achieving turnaround in operations in FY12.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">More investment coming in the form of the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor and the dedicated freight corridor planned for the same will bode well for logistics players such as GDL. Though roads account for a higher share of transportation, the cost efficiency of container movement via railways for distances over 500 km is well known, with the cost of transporting containers by road as much as 30-50% higher than rail. On the busy Delhi-Mumbai route, while the cost of transportation per TEU is between Rs 28,000 and Rs 42,000, it&rsquo;s more than Rs 62,000 by road, points out Krishnakant Thakur, analyst with Espirito Santo Securities.</p>\n<p class="p3">Moreover, GDL has implemented double stacking in the Garhi-Harsaru-Pipavav route. Double stacking entails two containers stacked on top of each other on a single bogey, thereby increasing capacity. This will improve its margins since double stacking increases operational costs by only 40%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In order to limit empty running of rakes on return journeys, it has also optimised routes. In effect, rakes while returning may stop over at an interim destination carrying freight and then run empty from that point onwards.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">GRFL is also the beneficiary of telescopic rate benefits introduced by Indian Railways. Simply put, this means that, earlier, if a rake travelled from point A to B to C, it would have to pay charges to the railways for both journeys. Now, it has to pay only once, from origin to final destination.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Then, in April 2013, the railways also partially answered a long-standing plea to do away with haulage charges, when it announced a 13% rollback on haulage charges for rakes running empty. GRFL has also started implementing a hub-and-spoke model for its rail services using the Garhi ICD as the hub for various spokes or nodes, thus reducing empty running significantly.</p>\n<p class="p3">Going ahead, the implementation of the dedicated freight corridor is expected to give a big fillip to the company. With line capacity utilisation varying from 115% to 150% on the existing trunk routes of Howrah-Delhi on the eastern corridor and Mumbai-Delhi on the western corridor, passenger trains are taking priority over goods trains in an already-clogged railway network. The DFC is expected to result in high share of freight for operators, especially GDL, since its ICD at Garhi-Harsaru and Faridabad are in close proximity to the DFC alignment, at 87 km and 54 km, respectively, from Dadri.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Not surprisingly, Niraj Mansingka of Edelweiss Capital is bullish on GDL. &ldquo;We are confident that the rail freight sector is set to grow because of the proposed Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor. Secondly, double stacking is likely to glean away market share in the longer term from trucking transporters.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">While the long-term looks good, in the short term the economic slowdown is proving a challenge. In Q1FY14, GRFL sales dipped 7% on a y-o-y basis owing to a 15% drop in volumes in the quarter owing to a sharp slowdown in exim trade. Says Sonam Udasi, head, research, IDBI Capital, &ldquo;In the near term, the outlook for the container and rail freight services businesses looks tepid. We don&rsquo;t see any earnings growth happening here.&rdquo; In 2009, Blackstone group invested Rs 300 crore in GRFL in the form of compulsorily convertible preference shares, which can be converted in FY14 or FY19. If Blackstone decides to convert these rather than exit, it will infuse significant funds into GRFL. And while the rail business will gain traction in the coming years, so will the cold chain business.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Ice, ice baby</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Gateway operates its cold chain and logistics subsidiary Snowman Frozen Foods, now known as SLL, in which it holds a 53% stake, in partnership with Mitsubishi Logistics Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation, Nichirei Logistics group and the International Finance Corporation, who collectively own 26% stake. The Bengaluru-based Snowman provides temperature-controlled storage services, catering to customers such as HUL, Baskin Robbins, Pizza Hut, Mother Dairy and ITC, among others. While contributing only 15% to Gateway&rsquo;s consolidated revenues, it is the fastest growing business segment seeing the most traction, having registered 58% y-o-y turnover growth in Q1FY14 and expected to generate 54% CAGR revenue growth by end-FY14.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">SLL has a nationwide presence in over 100 cities with distribution to more than 4,400 outlets and currently has a capacity of 53,130 pallets (refrigeration boxes in which both food and non-food perishables are stored), which will increase to 70,000 pallets by end-FY14 and 80,000 pallets by end-FY15. Traditionally, this sector suffers from a lack of proper capacities and adequate infrastructure. So the scope for expansion and growth is huge. According to a Technopak report, the market for cold chain storage and transportation is expected to grow from Rs 18,490 crore currently to over Rs 32,000 crore by FY15. Add to that the entry of foreign retailers and SLL&rsquo;s future prospects seem self-evident. In September this year, the company plans to list on the bourses with an IPO. While the guidance from the management has been that this will provide funds for its expansion plans, it is not clear whether there will be any part exits by existing investors (it had recently raised Rs 60 crore from PE fund Norwest).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Cool stock</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Though the stock has not been a great performer on the bourses, it has been resilient to the volatility in the market. At current levels, the stock is trading at under 10 times estimated FY14 earnings. Unlike most of its competitors, GDL is under-leveraged with a net debt-to-equity ratio of 0.13 in FY13. For now, analysts have largely retained a bullish view on the stock, given the traction in the rail container business, with Edelweiss looking at a price of Rs 169 and Espirito, Rs 167. &ldquo;Gateway has invested significant capex in all its businesses. As the macro climate improves, it is well poised to cash in on rising demand in the CFS and rail freight services segments,&rdquo; says Mansingka.</p>\n<p class="p3">However, Udasi of IDBI Capital, which has a target price of Rs 129, feels if the Snowman listing doesn&rsquo;t take off, it could be an overhang for the stock. Further deterioration in exim and domestic trade could result in meaningful decline in revenues for Gateway. Though the management hasn&rsquo;t given any guidance for FY14, in the concall, Pillai said he sees marginal growth in CFS but is &ldquo;more optimistic&rdquo; about the rail and Snowman businesses. While valuations do appear attractive, increasing volatility could offer better entry levels for long-term investors. &nbsp;</p>', 'Gateway Distriparks is banking on container rail and cold chain verticals to more than offset the decline in its core container freight station business', '11', '', 0, '', 'high-expectations-392', 386, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'High Expectations', 'Gateway Distriparks is banking on container rail and cold chain verticals to more than offset the decline in its core container freight station business', '', '', '', 'Gateway Distriparks,Corporate governance,Container freight station,Container rail', 0, NULL, '2015-02-02 20:00:02', '2015-02-03 12:48:27', '2013-09-14', 0),

(394, 24, '', 'Fault lines', '<p class="p1">I have known Rajat Gupta as a colleague at McKinsey &amp; Co. I, like many others, think of him as a great role model. So highly successful and yet so modest and unassuming, Rajat is a classic example of what one can accomplish through sheer hard work, character, courage and determination. Still unable to come to grips with how he has landed himself in the present circumstance, I am reminded of the pitfalls of Wall Street networks and relationships driven by the unending desire for success, defined predominantly by greed, corruption and power. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Anita Raghavan&rsquo;s book, <em>The Billionaire&rsquo;s Apprentice</em>, presents a vivid commentary on how Gupta grew up and the people and influences that shaped his values. With his deep-rooted belief in the Indian value system, Gupta prepared himself to perform at the global stage in a highly competitive environment. Despite a tepid start and an unconventional approach, he played to his people leadership capabilities to succeed at McKinsey. The ease with which Raj Rajaratnam of Galleon made Gupta walk in to his trap and network, however, comes as a big surprise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Raghavan has vividly illustrated insider trading activities at Galleon Hedge Fund and how a network of contacts was exploited brazenly, disrespecting all norms of professional conduct. The modus operandi and the huge sums of money involved are simply bone-chilling and highlight the enormous challenge that regulators face in tracking this illegal activity. Big money drives big people into making big mistakes. The book presents numerous examples of how Galleon exploited the professional and personal insecurities of several people to secure confidential non-public information and use it to make illegal personal gains through a skilfully cultivated web of tipsters. That the Galleon Hedge Fund could survive for so long is amazing. At the same time, it is reflective of the uphill task that the law enforcement machinery has on its hands when dealing with cases of insider trading and fighting the mafia of the financial underworld.</p>\n<p class="p3">The book makes for excellent reading with a perfect flow. With valuable perspectives developed through a large number of interviews, the author has very effectively presented the anatomy of successful leaders in a wide variety of situations and shown how some succumb to their fears and insecurities arising out of loss of power and position. She also narrates some very interesting and informative accounts of success stories of immigrants of Indian origin in the United States. Raghavan has also been able to successfully bring out the fallacy of the oft-mistaken belief &ldquo;Too successful to sink&rdquo; that many leaders could fall prey to. It makes one sit up and think about &ldquo;What successful leaders should never do&rdquo;.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Insights</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Are factory outlets good for brands?</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1">Though factory stores may be a boon for serial shoppers, what kind of impact does opening one have on a brand? It is often assumed that opening a factory store may damage the brand&rsquo;s image or divert consumers from its main retail outlets. It is also possible that it may help the brand attract a newer set of customers. Poring over 12 years&rsquo; worth of data relating to one such store, researchers <strong>Yi Qian</strong>, <strong>Eric Anderson</strong> and <strong>Duncan Simester</strong> found that the introduction of the factory store did, in fact, lead to positive spillovers to the retailer&rsquo;s core business. They found that customers ended up purchasing more products from the higher priced, higher quality stores of the brand once the factory store opened. This shift accounted for almost 17% of the incremental sales from the opening of the factory store.</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>Title:</strong>&nbsp;Multichannel Spillovers from a Factory Store</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>Source:</strong> The National Bureau of Economic Research</p>\n<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Do individual investors learn from their mistakes?</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1">Learning from past mistakes is often the best way to grow.

(395, 24, '', 'In defence of tradition', '<p class="p1">This season, I met up with friends from the fashion world after a gap of some years to see the kind of work they&rsquo;re doing in bridalwear and couture (the two are mostly interchangeable in India) to find that not all that much has changed. Heavy embroidery still gets major play with all of them, and depending on your taste it can range from the gasp-out-loud in its dazzling sumptuousness to the outright vulgar. The cuts are cleaner, the <em>karigars</em> they employ along with the range of technology and materials available to them means that the quality is much better than in previous decades or even centuries, and, combined with the kind of detailing customers are demanding, they are creating museum-quality heirlooms.</p>\n<p class="p2">That&rsquo;s the good part. The bad part &mdash; and I&rsquo;m no expert &mdash; is that they seem to have been trapped in the whole jiggery-pokery of Western silhouettes. For years, Western designers told us what Indian fashion lacked was silhouette, which is all right if you&rsquo;re speaking about office fashion (which is never couture anyway), or even red carpet appearances, when you appear for a photo-op before getting out of something you can&rsquo;t sit down in.</p>\n<p class="p2">That&rsquo;s precisely what&rsquo;s happened to our bridal couture. The <em>lehnga</em> (or skirt) has become so stiff over time because of the intricacy of heavy detailing and the designer decree of a silhouette that it might as well be made out of cardboard &mdash; or even Teflon. It&rsquo;s so stiff that brides, already weighed down by kilos of jewellery, no longer find it comfortable to even walk in them. I admired JJ Valaya&rsquo;s exquisite eye for design and embroidery, but had to wonder which bride would be able to sit down in such a <em>lehnga</em>. Or Suneet Varma&rsquo;s <em>lehngas</em>, for instance, where the swish seemed to have gone out of the skirt, to be replaced entirely by structure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Rohit Bal always manages to bridge that distinction brilliantly and uses fabrics intelligently to create clothes that have a life beyond just one couture outing, for which reason I believe he&rsquo;s India&rsquo;s one true master. Anamika Khanna is excellent. Manish Arora is, well, maverick. But if there&rsquo;s a couture designer I admire, it has to be Sabyasachi. And that&rsquo;s not just because he&rsquo;s remained the darling of the glitterati over the past few seasons. Do I like all his embroideries and weaves and glittery stuff together in a single garment? I&rsquo;d have to say the jury&rsquo;s out on that one. What I most definitely do not like is the use of new materials such as net that end up looking like sequined mosquito nets. Surely chiffons and georgettes are way better, and certainly drape nicer.</p>\n<p class="p2">But who am I to argue when, in fact, the reason why I applaud Sabyasachi is his mastery over drapes. There is no tension in his finished garments &mdash; whether <em>lehngas</em> or sarees. His couture wear has flounce and flow. Not only can you walk comfortably in his clothes, you can lounge around in them, perching on a sofa or settling down on the floor. Isn&rsquo;t that what weddings are &mdash; occasions to have fun without wondering if the fitted corset is going to suffocate you?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">And, oh yes, he&rsquo;s classy enough to create a range that has gown-like styles, perfect for friends and guests who don&rsquo;t want to compete with the bride. The kind of clothes you can repeat (the equivalent of social hara-kiri, I know) at a Diwali party or office outing without looking out of place. You&rsquo;ve got to appreciate him for that. <span class="s1"><br /></span></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>&mdash;The author is a Delhi-based&nbsp;writer and curator</strong></p>', 'Or why designers should stop forcing western silhouettes on Indian bridal wear  ', '17', '', 0, '', 'in-defence-of-tradition-395', 389, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'In defence of tradition', 'Or why designers should stop forcing western silhouettes on Indian bridal wear  ', '', '', '', 'Bridal wear,Bridal couture,Sabyasachi,Manish Malhotra,Anamika Khanna,Rohit Bal', 0, NULL, '2015-02-03 13:10:19', '2015-02-03 13:15:16', '2013-09-14', 0),

(398, 12, '', 'Looking for a big bite', '<p class="p1">What&rsquo;s cooking at Mrs Bector&rsquo;s Food Specialities? The Ludhiana-based company, started by Rajni Bector in 1978 as a household enterprise, is now a Rs 700-crore entity with interests in bread, sauces, syrups and biscuits and a strong presence in north India with the Cremica label. The company has seen a spate of private equity investment. Jade Garden, the Mauritius-based unit of Goldman Sachs, had invested Rs 72 crore in 2006 and, four years later, sold its 22.44% stake to Motilal Oswal Private Equity (MOPE).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While Jade Garden is said to have exited at a marginal profit, all eyes are now on MOPE as it is negotiating a part-exit from Mrs Bector&rsquo;s. Rakesh Sony, director, MOPE, confirmed that his company is planning an exit through a secondary sale to a larger private equity fund.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Sweet and sour - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Part of the excitement around the Mrs Bector&rsquo;s exit is because MOPE had made a respectable 3X return when it exited a part of its holding in Parag Milk Foods in September last year. MOPE had invested #55 crore in 2008 for a 10-12% stake in the dairy company. This investment was made out of its India Business Excellence Fund (corpus: $125 million), where the average ticket size was in the $5-15 million range. The investment in Mrs Bector&rsquo;s is also a part of this fund.</p>\n<p class="p3">The sudden flurry of activity is because of a division of the firm between the founder&rsquo;s three sons. Akshay Bector will lead the Rs 200-crore B2B business that supplies bread, sauces and syrups to clients such as McDonald&rsquo;s, Pizza Hut and Barista. The two other sons, Anoop and Ajay, will run the B2C business that owns Cremica biscuits with a Rs 500 crore turnover, said to be second-largest by volume in Punjab and Haryana. Incidentally, the firm will also engage in contract manufacturing for Cadbury&rsquo;s Oreo biscuits and some Sunfeast brands owned by ITC.</p>\n<p class="p3">Following the demerger, MOPE will stay invested in Akshay&rsquo;s business but will exit the biscuits business. While MOPE has put its 22.44% holding on the block, Ajay is also expected to sell his 24% stake. Anoop Bector, managing director, Mrs Bector&rsquo;s Food Specialities, and head of the biscuits business, will continue to hold 53% and has no intention of selling his stake. Says Anoop, &ldquo;The biscuits business is growing well at 18-20% a year and plans are afoot to set up a third plant. We are in the process of firming up the location and it should be ready in about a year.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">What could impact Mrs Bector&rsquo;s biscuit business valuations are Cremica&rsquo;s limited presence outside north India and pressure on margins across players on the back of rising input costs. Siddhartha Nigam, partner and leader (consumer sector), Grant Thornton, points out that there is much interest among PE funds around the domestic consumption story. &ldquo;However, this is subject to having a strong brand, good distribution and scale of operation. Growth in this industry normally takes the shape of a hockey stick and PE funds will have to wait longer than usual to make good returns,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>', 'Can Motilal Oswal PE hit the jackpot by selling its stake in the Mrs Bector''s biscuits business?', '7', '', 0, '', 'looking-for-a-big-bite-398', 392, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Looking for a big bite', 'Can Motilal Oswal PE hit the jackpot by selling its stake in the Mrs Bector''s biscuits business?', '', '', '', 'Mrs Bector''s biscuits,Cremica biscuits,Motilal Oswal,PE funds', 0, NULL, '2015-02-03 17:00:12', '2015-02-03 17:12:01', '2013-10-12', 0),
(399, 12, '', 'Indulgence, delivered', '<p class="p1">Two-and-a-half years ago, when beautician Hema Balkrishna Baramate first came to work for Belita, she knew that the company was a new concept in beauty treatment and that customers wouldn&rsquo;t come to her; instead, she would have to go visit them. What caught her off-guard, though, was that the 200-sq ft office at Chandivali, Mumbai, turned out to be much smaller than the Saki Naka branch of one of Baramate&rsquo;s previous employers, VLCC. Amid the other storefronts in the area, Belita&rsquo;s striking pink board stood out to Baramate. &ldquo;I was shocked when I first walked in. It didn&rsquo;t look anything like a beauty salon,&rdquo; she says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Far from any corporate trappings or even the cheery feel of a salon, Belita&rsquo;s &lsquo;office&rsquo; looked more like a warehouse. It was, in fact, the company&rsquo;s logistics centre, with only the bare essentials &mdash; storage for beauty kits, a bench to sit on and a personal computer and a desk for the telephone operator who booked customer appointments.</p>\n<p class="p3">What the now 26-year-old Baramate couldn&rsquo;t have guessed then was the pace at which her career would take off. Joining Belita as a junior therapist with barely four years of experience, she was soon promoted to be a senior therapist and now manages a team of 15 therapists as the assistant branch manager for Belita&rsquo;s Chandivali branch. More than the pay hike, it was the added responsibilities and training that motivated her to join the company. &ldquo;Once I become a branch manager, there&rsquo;ll be more people under me,&rdquo; she beams.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>A pretty neat idea</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Started in September 2010, Belita provides beauty and spa services to women at the location of their choice. &ldquo;It need not be someone&rsquo;s home, it could be their workplace as well,&rdquo; CEO Garima Jain points out. Belita, which means &lsquo;little beauty&rsquo; in Spanish, came to life, thanks to a prod by her husband Akshay, a first-generation entrepreneur and founder of Vedam Designs, a marine design and consultancy firm. &ldquo;One evening in 2009, we ordered pizza from a chain restaurant and, given how frustrated I was about not being able to find time to get waxing done, I exclaimed, &lsquo;Why can&rsquo;t we have home delivery for beauty services, where beauticians can come to your home even late at night?&rsquo;.&nbsp; My husband simply said, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you start one?&rsquo;,&rdquo; narrates Jain, 29, an MBA in international business from IPS Academy, Indore, who was then working long hours as an area manager with a financial services advisory company.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Belita - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The next morning, she had made up her mind. With support from her husband, Rs 6 lakh of her savings and some market research, Jain launched Belita six months later from the Mumbai suburb where she lives. She signed up a senior therapist to train some junior beauticians and freshers and started operations 15 days later.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Belita&rsquo;s first port of call was a posh residential complex in Powai, close to Jain&rsquo;s residence. During the next month, some 2,000 leaflets were distributed and Belita was able to reach around 100 customers from the 4,000-odd families residing in the upmarket central Mumbai suburb. &ldquo;Women loved the fact that our services were as hygienic and professional as any other good salon, plus they didn&rsquo;t have to venture out of their homes,&rdquo; says Jain, who visited all the customers personally. In November 2011, she bagged her first corporate client. Deloitte had organised a fashion show for its employees and Belita was made in charge of beauty services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The biggest hurdle during that period was finding the right people to do the job. Jain initially tried hiring people from existing salons, but it was difficult to convince them to visit customers&rsquo; homes. She then started seeking out freelance beauticians and freshers and training them.&nbsp;Jain says freshers pick up skills better as they&rsquo;re more adaptable to the idea of going to a customer&rsquo;s place, compared with those used to working at salons.</p>\n<p class="p3">Today, Belita works out of three logistics centres in Chandivali, Hiranandani and the JVLR-Goregaon area in Mumbai. A customer within a 4-5 km radius of its centres can call and book its services, which include group services, pre-bridal and bridal beauty services and pamper parties, where women gather to enjoy beauty services. Jain usually caters to eight to 10 pamper parties every month, which can cost anywhere between Rs 5,000 and Rs 50,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Instead of smaller individual services, Belita offers combinations or packages that ensure a healthy minimum ticket value per customer and margins of 20-25%. &ldquo;Providing individual services to customers isn&rsquo;t profitable,&rdquo; points out Jain. Most of the company&rsquo;s current revenue of Rs 12 lakh a month comes from pamper parties &mdash; over 60 of them having been organised so far &mdash; with a good chunk coming in from individual customers as well.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Belita has served over 7,500 customers, some even at 6.30 in the morning and some at midnight. At such times, the therapists go out in a group in the company&rsquo;s vans, whose drivers have undergone police verification.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class="p3">Minus the rentals and initial expenses of putting up a salon, Belita is able to serve 75 customers a day &mdash; the same as any standalone salon, Jain adds. The only investment has been the Rs 8-9 lakh needed to start each branch or centre, rentals for the two vans that ferry its therapists, and the Tata Nano that the firm owns. Apart from that, consumables, including the beauty kits, make up less than 20% of Belita&rsquo;s operating expenses. With 400-450 customer visits in a month, a centre usually breaks even in six months. And with FY13 revenues at Rs 80 lakh, Jain is aiming for around &nbsp;Rs 1.4 crore this year. &ldquo;If I compare myself with other big salon chains, I think I am doing better.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"If I compare myself with other big salon chains, I think I am doing better" - Garima Jain, CEO, Belita</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The service is still promoted through leaflets, social media, word-of-mouth, or simply &lsquo;walk-in&rsquo; customers who are curious about Belita&rsquo;s offerings. Among them was Disha Sharan, an area business manager at Tanishq. &ldquo;It occurred to me that we could host their services in our stores on special occasions such as festivals and when there are long billing queues,&rdquo;&nbsp; says Sharan. Since then, Tanishq&rsquo;s large-format store at Turner Road in Mumbai has called upon Belita to pamper its customers on its first anniversary and on Teachers&rsquo; Day.</p>\n<p class="p3">One such customer on the store&rsquo;s first anniversary was 29-year-old physiotherapist Poorvi Shah, who hails from Nandurbar and has been living in Mumbai for the past seven years. Weekends for Shah are busier than weekdays, which involve a two-hour commute and a long queue of patients, beginning at 9 am and ending not before 9 pm. Meeting her relatives in the city takes up her weekends, and Shah says it often takes her days to plan a trip to the beauty parlour for even basic services.</p>\n<p class="p3">One Sunday when Shah had gone to the same Tanishq store for some gold shopping, she was pleasantly surprised. &ldquo;There were big dark pink banners everywhere and there were seven girls wearing pink Belita t-shirts. Customers were getting manicures, pedicures, face clean-up and different procedures done from these girls,&rdquo; recalls Shah, who got herself a free pedicure and nail art done after she completed her shopping.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Making it work</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Therapists, as Jain calls her beauticians, are key to Belita&rsquo;s growth, with 40 of them currently on its rolls. They undergo 15 days of training upon joining, and there are regular workshops and refresher courses through institutes such as the VLCC Training Institute, the Butic Institute of Beauty Therapy and the Christine Valmy International Academy of Beauty. &ldquo;Belita usually opts for product-centric services, which is a three-day course,&rdquo; explains Nalini Kalra, general manager, Christine Valmy International Academy of Beauty, which has been associated with the company for a year now and has been conducting training and refresher courses for its employees. There&rsquo;s also a full-time in-house trainer now.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The company now has a team of some 60 people, with six to seven junior therapists, five to six senior therapists, one assistant branch manager and one branch manager for each branch. &ldquo;These assistant branch managers and branch managers are from among the therapist pool,&rdquo; explains Jain. A therapist attends to a maximum of three customers a day, with an average spend per customer of Rs 1,000-1,500.&nbsp; Belita keeps a check on the quality of its services at clients&rsquo; homes and offices through an extensive feedback channel, which ensures that close to 70% of its clients are repeat customers.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Bright presence</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The idea clearly appeals to not just customers, but investors as well. In January 2012, Belita raised Rs 2 crore from angel investor Anand Lunia of India Quotient. Of this, Rs 75 lakh has come in, while the rest will be invested in the coming years. &ldquo;My first impression was that this model is going to be profitable very soon,&rdquo; says Lunia. &ldquo;I do not expect every woman to be Belita&rsquo;s customer, given that it attracts a very niche consumer category. But negligible real estate cost is the business&rsquo; biggest strength,&rdquo; he adds further.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Belita attracts a very niche consumer category, but low real estate cost is its strength" - Anand Lunia, founder, India Quotient&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The business became even more well-organised after Jain got a chance to attend a three month-long Goldman Sachs-sponsored ISB Entrepreneurship programme for Asian women in end-2010. &ldquo;It helped me think like an entrepreneur. I used to focus on volumes earlier, but the course helped me realise that value works better,&rdquo; Jain points out, adding that aggressive expansion plans do not work if the quality of work is not being maintained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Jain is looking for more external funding now.

(400, 16, '', 'The buzz gets louder', '<p class="p1">When it comes to mosquito repellents, India has a pretty wide variety to offer &mdash; vaporisers, mats, coils, aerosols, gels and creams. And given the country&rsquo;s tropical, bug-friendly climate, they&rsquo;re all used well and frequently, right? Wrong. About 56% Indians don&rsquo;t use any mosquito repellent at all, a number that climbs to an alarming 72% when it comes to rural households. Those are uncomfortable numbers for Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL). The market leader in the Indian household insecticides market, like its peers, has been unable to exploit the full potential for its products in rural India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The gap can be attributed to unfavourable price points and lack of electrification in villages, believe analysts. That automatically rules out vaporisers and mats, leaving the old-fashioned mosquito coil as perhaps the only option. But not only does it emit smoke, it isn&rsquo;t exactly cheap, either.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Which is where GCPL&rsquo;s new product comes in. Good Knight Fast Card, which will be formally launched in early October, is a strip of paper that burns for three minutes and claims to keep mosquitoes away for four hours. Jointly developed by GCPL&rsquo;s research teams in India and Indonesia, the product is sold in Indonesia under the Hit Magic Paper brand name. The new repellent ticks all the important boxes &mdash; doesn&rsquo;t emit smoke, doesn&rsquo;t require electricity and is cheaper than coils. &ldquo;Mosquito repellent coils cost close to Rs 2.5 per night. But the new repellent will cost Re 1 per strip. GCPL has broken a price barrier. This will help the company increase penetration,&rdquo; says Harsh Mehta, analyst, HDFC Securities.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Room for growth - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The Rs 3,200-crore household insecticides market in India has been growing at 10-15% during the past three to four years and GCPL, for the most part, has been twice as fast. Currently, 44% of the company&rsquo;s revenues come from this category, of which a third is from rural markets. Will the Fast Card help GCPL pick up even more speed? There&rsquo;s the threat of cannibalisation, after all, since the company sells coils under the Good Knight and Jet brands. While that&rsquo;s a risk, Mehta remains positive. &ldquo;Competitor coil users might switch, too. Also, while margins are not known, they will certainly be higher than coils,&rdquo; he points out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The timing is off, says Anand Ramanathan, associate director, KPMG Advisory. &ldquo;This is a seasonal product. The monsoons, when mosquitoes thrive, would have been a better time for such a launch,&rdquo; he explains. Moreover, a product like this, while it has the potential to disrupt the market, also requires more marketing effort. Customers will have to be educated on how to use the product, Ramanathan adds. But if GCPL gets the pricing right, that may be enough to get the job done.&nbsp;</p>', 'Godrej Consumer hopes to break into rural households with its new paper mosquito repellant', '9', '', 0, '', 'the-buzz-gets-louder-400', 394, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'The buzz gets louder', 'Godrej Consumer hopes to break into rural households with its new paper mosquito repellant', '', '', '', 'Godrej Consumer Products,Mosquito repellant,Good Knight Fast Card', 0, NULL, '2015-02-03 17:30:11', '2015-02-03 18:07:28', '2013-10-12', 0),

These are owned by non-banking companies but vend cash through a sponsor bank. With the RBI&rsquo;s approval in February 2012 for rolling out WLAs, India joins many countries globally in opening up ATM networks to companies outside of the banking network.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The chief objective is to increase the reach of banking services to India&rsquo;s rural and un-banked citizens. Of the 124,000 ATMs across India today, only 35% are in semi-urban and rural areas. PSU banks own 60% of all the ATMs in the country and <span class="s2">with only 98 ATMs for a million people compared with 211 in China and 1,390 in the US, India ranks way below in ATM coverage. With 514.3 million transactions being done via ATMs, the RBI has put its weig</span>ht behind WLAs as a faster route to make basic banking accessible to the masses.</p>\n<p class="p3">Tata Communications Payment Solutions (TCPSL) was the first off the block in June with its Indicash WLA at Chandrapada village in Maharashtra&rsquo;s Thane district. Since then, it has deployed 200 WLAs across Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala, with plans to take this number to 15,000 over the next three years. A spokesperson for TCPSL says that for every two WLAs installed in a semi-urban or rural area, it plans to have one in a tier 1 or tier 2 city.</p>\n<p class="p3">Number of AtMs in the country</p>\n<p class="p3">Next in line is Muthoot Finance, better known for its gold loans business. Its first WLA is coming up in November in Delhi and Kerala with plans to roll out 9,000 WLAs in three years time. &ldquo;We plan to install 1,000 WLAs in the first year of operations and there will be another 2,000 in the second year,&rdquo; says KR Bijimon, chief general manager, Muthoot Finance. Muthoot is in talks with IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank and Federal Bank to be its sponsor bank for the project. Incidentally, Muthoot Finance and Tata Sons are among the 26 applicants to have applied for a banking licence, as well.</p>\n<p class="p3">The cost of operating a WLA is not very different from a regular bank ATM, Bijimon points out. &ldquo;The initial investment is Rs 5-7 lakh per ATM with a running cost between Rs 20,000 and Rs 50,000 every month. Break-even is typically achieved at 80 transactions per day,&rdquo; he says. TCPSL charges Rs 15 for a cash transaction and Rs 5 for a non-cash transaction at its WLA. Currently, five free transactions per month at ATMs of other banks are permitted but after the sixth transaction, around Rs 17-18 for each transaction is charged by bank owning the ATM. More importantly, WLAs can generate additional revenues come from third-party advertising. &ldquo;Unlike a bank, we are permitted to display third-party advertisements, which is a potential source of revenue,&rdquo; says the TCPSL spokesperson.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But the success of WLAs will depend on how private and public sector banks take to the concept. Chitra Pandeya, senior president and country head (liabilities management, cards and direct banking), Yes Bank, agrees that new ATM operators could help address under-penetration of banking services, but WLAs can succeed only when banks open more accounts in rural markets. &ldquo;ATM usage is purely dependent on the number of cards issued and this is something that needs to be resolved by all the banks together,&rdquo; she points out.</p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s3">There are other challenges too. &ldquo;Certain markets will get crowded, and that is a bit of a concern,&rdquo; says Ritesh Raj Saxena, head, savings accounts and direct banking, IndusInd Bank. Moreover, since WLA operators aren&rsquo;t known brands in the banking space, a customer may not be as comfortable transacting here as at a bank ATM. &ldquo;From our point of view, it opens up a new market for us, and that is of people who do not have bank accounts,&rdquo; Saxena says. Indeed, with 80% of its ATMs in urban India, for IndusInd Bank, like others, WLAs could open up a whole new world of opportunity, faster than ever before.&nbsp;</span></p>', 'How domestic white label ATM players plan to quench private and public banks'' thirst for a wider reach', '7', '', 0, '', 'whats-in-a-name-401', 395, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'What''s in a name?', 'How domestic white label ATM players plan to quench private and public banks'' thirst for a wider reach', '', '', '', 'ATMs,White Label ATM', 0, NULL, '2015-02-03 18:09:10', '2015-02-03 18:31:00', '2013-10-12', 0),
(402, 16, '', 'Can Pidilite keep blowing its trumpet?', '<p class="p1">Walk into any hardware store on Mumbai&rsquo;s crowded Andheri-Kurla Road and you will be greeted by huge cans of Fevicol adhesive, smaller packs of&nbsp;M-Seal precariously perched on top of each other and rolls of Steelgrip insulated tape usually lying stacked in a corner. Hansraj Gupta&rsquo;s Satyam Plywood &amp; Veneer is no different, except that he has a larger store than most and an unusually extensive basket of Pidilite products to offer &mdash; apart from various size packs of the original synthetic resin adhesive, the white-painted shelves prominently display other products such as Fevicol SpeedX, SR 998, Terminator and Woodgrip. &ldquo;We sell close to 1 tonne of Pidilite products every month, which is about a third of our monthly sales. If I had more space, I would stock all of its products,&rdquo; says Gupta. Stroll a little further down the road and Sankalp Stationers is equally happy with Pidilite products. Store owner Pravin Kumar says customers don&rsquo;t want other brands even if they are priced lower. &ldquo;They ask for Fevistick glue and Rangeela paints by name,&rdquo; he points out.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>A finger in each pie - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Since its inception over 50 years ago, Pidilite&rsquo;s Fevicol has become synonymous with glue: Fevicol for all-purpose adhesive, Fevistick for paper glue and Fevikwik for instant, one-drop adhesive <em>(see: A finger in each pie)</em>. So much so, that the brand even made it to the lyrics of a Bollywood &lsquo;item&rsquo; song last year. But then, Pidilite has worked hard at becoming ubiquitous. Its brand is available at over 1 million retail outlets across the country, serviced by one of the most extensive distribution networks &mdash; 4,000 dealers, 26 depots and 20 manufacturing plants. That ubiquity reflects in the numbers as well. In the past decade, Pidilite&rsquo;s revenue has climbed from Rs 765 crore in FY04 to Rs 3,615 crore in FY13, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19%. Net profit over the same period has grown at 25%, from Rs 61 crore in FY04 to Rs 461 crore last year. And investors clearly approve: the stock price, too, has gone up more than 28% in the past five years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s not all good news, though. Pidilite&rsquo;s ambitious overseas moves haven&rsquo;t worked out quite as it planned nor has the industrial products business expanded as fast as the company would have liked. The result is that the Mumbai-based company is bonded more firmly to its consumer bazaar business than ever before. How will this play out for Asia&rsquo;s largest selling adhesive brand?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Sticky business</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Pidilite was started in 1954 by Balvantray Kalyanji Parekh to manufacture specialty chemicals and pigment emulsions for the textile industry. The entry into synthetic glue manufacture began five years later and right from the start, Parekh did things differently from his competition (one foreign brand and several local, no-name variants). Rather than simply sell the glue to dealers, his team would reach out directly to carpenters and furniture makers, explaining why its product was superior and could be used for various purposes. Sales picked up and before long, Parekh made adhesives the main line of business. The flagship synthetic resin glue aside, over the years, the company launched several different types of adhesive, but the practice of first sharing the product with the people who actually use it &mdash; carpenters, plumbers and craftsmen &mdash; remains. Starting in the 1990s, Pidilite has also introduced a series of Fevicol Furniture books, showcasing samples of Indian design &mdash; some 31 volumes have been released so far, which have collectively sold over 10 million copies. &ldquo;Such on-ground activities have given us medium to long-term benefits for over 50 years now,&rdquo; says Madhukar Balvantray Parekh, the founder&rsquo;s son and Pidilite&rsquo;s current managing director.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Consumer products, which include adhesives and sealants, construction and paint chemicals and art materials, continue to be Pidilite&rsquo;s mainstay &mdash; the segment&rsquo;s contribution to total revenue has increased from 73% in FY05 to 81% in FY13 and registered a growth of 20.5% last year <em>(see: On popular demand)</em>. The rest of Pidilite&rsquo;s income comes from industrial resins, adhesives and pigments, which grew about half as fast as the consumer business last year.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>On popular demand - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">You don&rsquo;t have to look for reasons why the consumer business is doing well. The direct connect with users, including workshops to explain new products and teach new techniques at the in-house Dr Fixit Institute, has helped Pidilite build immense brand loyalty. Analysts and industry observers believe the &lsquo;prescription&rsquo; route adopted by the company &mdash; influencing the intermediary user, who can recommend its products &mdash; has been particularly successful. Where M-Seal and Dr Fixit are promoted through plumbers, carpenters recommend Fevicol. &ldquo;The kind of understanding Pidilite has of the Indian market is commendable. It has followed the right process in knowing the customer, and that has worked to its advantage,&rdquo; says Abraham Koshy, professor of marketing at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Combine that with strong distribution, very effective advertising and sound acquisitions, and it is a powerful recipe for success. &ldquo;We keep our eyes and ears open to what customers want, while our strong R&amp;D gets us exactly the right products,&rdquo; Parekh explains Pidilite&rsquo;s growth. He points to a to-be-launched product under the M-Seal umbrella as a case in point. &ldquo;Masons traditionally use white cement to fill gaps in grouting etc. But we have seen that these develop cracks after a while, so we have come up with a better and longer-lasting alternative,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We keep our eyes and ears open to what customers want, while our strong R&amp;D gets us exactly the right products" - MB Parekh, managing director, Pidilite</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Pidilite has also spent very judiciously on advertising. For the past 15 years, Ogilvy &amp; Mather has held the Pidilite account and created several memorable campaigns for its various products, including an unbreakable egg, people clinging to the sides of a bus, a shadow that refuses to budge and a joint family that sticks together. Piyush Pandey, executive chairman and national creative director, O&amp;M, recalls a multinational executive asking him several years ago how Pidilite could afford to spend Rs 20 crore on advertising. &ldquo;Actually, Pidilite&rsquo;s budget was only Rs 3 crore, but the [Fevicol] ads were effective and had a huge impact,&rdquo; he says. Now, of course, the company spends much more &mdash; in FY13, Pidilite saw a 37% increase in advertising and promotional expenditure, spending close to Rs 132 crore compared with Rs 96 crore the previous year. &ldquo;If possible, we plan to increase the expenditure on ad and promotions this year,&rdquo; says Parekh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Early on, Pidilite''s budget was only Rs 3 crore, but the [Fevicol] ads were effective and had a huge impact" - Piyush Pandey, executive chairman and NCD, O&amp;M</strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Importantly, Pidilite consciously sought opportunities to enter new niche strategies in the adhesive and sealant space, primarily through a string of acquisitions. It made its first buy in 1999, paying Rs 4 crore for the Ranipal brand from Indian Dyestuff Industries. The next year, it bought M-Seal and Dr Fixit from Mahindra Engineering &amp; Chemical Products. Two years later, it bought Steelgrip from Bhor Steelgrip Tapes, followed by a construction chemical brand, Roff, in 2006. The trend has continued with the company buying the adhesives business (Falcofix brand) of Suparshva Adhesives in August. &ldquo;Though the company&rsquo;s [Suparshava] turnover is less than 1% of the Pidilite&rsquo;s turnover, it [Falcofix] is a good brand with decent market share in parts of Maharashtra other than Mumbai,&rdquo; Sandeep Batra, Pidilite&rsquo;s director of finance, told analysts in a post Q1FY14 call.</span></p>\n<p class="p3">The buyouts are also a conscious attempt by the company to curb competition at all price points. As Batra pointed out to analysts, &ldquo;Fevicol as the market leader cannot compete with all brands pan-India, which are priced at many different price points. So, we always have the need to have other brands in the overall portfolio.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">But then, the inorganic route has not been confined to the sealant and adhesive space; Pidilite has effectively used it to venture into allied businesses as well. In 2004, it forayed into the art and craft space, launching the Hobby Ideas chain of stores. To cater to this venture, in 2006, Pidilite acquired Tristar Colman for art canvases and colours. In-house product innovations plus the acquisitions mean Pidilite now has a 64 product-strong portfolio focused on retail consumers, as well as 20 Hobby Ideas stores across eight cities. In FY13, the art material business grew by 35% against the company&rsquo;s historical average of 10-15%. Not surprisingly, in the coming years, the company plans to invest Rs 120 crore every year in the consumer and bazaar segment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">From Rs 1,512 crore five years ago, the segment accounted for Rs 2,674 crore of revenue last year. Parekh expects some pressure on margins owing to rising input costs but considers that a passing phase. &ldquo;We will bring in innovations in products and new launches, for which customers won&rsquo;t mind paying,&rdquo; he says optimistically.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Feeling the blues</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The industrial segment hasn&rsquo;t been as fortunate. Supplies to industries such as packaging, textile, paint and footwear have been hit by slowing economic growth in India as well as decreasing demand from Europe and the US. With the result that, from a high of 24.4% in FY11, growth in this segment crashed to 9.5% the following year and marginally improved to 10.6% last year. &ldquo;A fair amount of our industrial products is exported and those economies aren&rsquo;t in the best health either,&rdquo; Batra said in the analyst call. Analysts, too, don&rsquo;t hold out much hope for this business to improve any time soon, given the poor external environment. &ldquo;This segment is a play on the Indian GDP and IIP as, here, Pidilite&rsquo;s products are more a commodity than a brand. If industrial growth is at a 10-year low, Pidilite really cannot do much. Passing on rising costs is also a tough call in this segment, so margins will go for a toss,&rdquo; points out Abneesh Roy, associate director, institutional equities, Edelweiss.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"A fair amount of our industrial products is exported and those economies aren''t in the best health either" - Sandeep Batra, director, finance, Pidilite</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">And costs have certainly been rising. In 2007, Pidilite merged the manufacturing asset of a group company, Vinyl Chemicals India, with itself to bring in economies of scale in procurement of vinyl acetate monomer (VAM), a major input for adhesives and industrial resins. A couple of years ago, though, it stopped making VAM and currently imports all its requirement of the input. Sharp increases in VAM prices has meant that expenditure on imports has risen from Rs 178.62 crore in FY12 to Rs 210.67 crore last year, which has been passed on to consumers through price increases. Now, a depreciating rupee will only make matters worse.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Moreover, exports aren&rsquo;t doing as well as earlier. Currently, the company exports to some 80 countries. But the share of exports in total revenue has dropped from 9% in FY12 to 8% in FY13 &mdash; exports of specialty industrial chemicals were affected by the weak global economic situation and grew only 8.2% in FY12, compared with the previous five years&rsquo; growth of 19.8%. Then, a new 20,000 TPA synthetic elastomer plant was to come up at Dahej at a capex of Rs 500 crore. It was to go onstream by FY10 and manufacture polychloroprene elastomer used in automotive and industrial components and adhesives, and give a boost to exports to Europe and North America. After repeated delays, the project was finally put on hold in 2012; the company has spent over Rs 360 crore already on the stalled project. &ldquo;The Dahej plant was to help expand capacity. As the investment in the project must have already washed away, Pidilite needs to take strong steps to make its balance sheet lighter,&rdquo; says Amnish Agarwal, senior vice-president, research, Prabhudas Lilladher.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Overseas ahoy</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Similarly, Pidilite hasn&rsquo;t been able to cover enough ground in its overseas forays, either. It has 14 subsidiaries with manufacturing facilities and selling operations around the world. But, barring five ventures, the rest have been loss-making for several years. There was some improvement in FY13, barring Brazil and Egypt. Sales grew 10.2% in the US, 22% in Thailand and 34% in Bangladesh, but at Rs 44 crore, full-year losses incurred by overseas subsidiaries in FY13 were still much higher than the previous year&rsquo;s Rs 25.4 crore. Pidilite&rsquo;s overseas subsidiaries have been loss-making for the past eight years, dragging down the overall profitability and return ratios of the group. Rishikesha T Krishnan, professor of entrepreneurship at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, says, &ldquo;Indian firms still need to look at overseas investments on a more long-term basis and should think twice before entering and exiting a new market. Currently, Indian companies need to stick to diversifying more on the domestic front than going abroad as the latter is too challenging for them to handle.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Indian firms need to look at overseas investments in the long term and think twice before entering &nbsp;new markets" - Rishikesha Krishnan, professor, IIM-Bangalore</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Last year, Pidilite invested Rs 26 crore in overseas ventures, taking total investment till date to Rs 303 crore. &ldquo;We have not made any acquisition outside India [since 2007] largely because of the realisation that the company needed to first integrate the acquisitions that have been made and make sure they perform to the standards expected from a Pidilite entity,&rdquo; conceded Batra in the concall.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Failure to launch - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The last acquisition was of Pulvitec in Brazil, the worst-performer in the Pidilite stable. External factors such as weak infrastructural investment, a falling GDP and difficult political system have given Brazil the reputation of being a graveyard for Indian companies &mdash; certainly, biggies such as Godrej Consumer and Asian Paints have burnt their fingers badly in this market. Pidilite is no exception. In FY13, the South American subsidiary made a loss of Rs 41.5 crore. And even as the company talks of &ldquo;structural intervention&rdquo; to ensure the business starts making cash profits at the earliest, analysts think hiving off Pulvitec may be a better bet. &ldquo;The challenge for Pidilite will be to find a suitable buyer. With a loss-making subsidiary, it will be tougher to find a buyer offering a decent price. To begin with, it was a mistake taking over a loss-making entity. If Pidilite is able to dilute it, investors will rejoice,&rdquo; says Roy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With overseas and industrial segments not doing as well as expected, Pidilite&rsquo;s only recourse for growth is its consumer and bazaar products segments. Thankfully, the company doesn&rsquo;t have to try very hard in this category &mdash; it has a proven track record when it comes to connecting with customers and launching innovative products in niche segments. But it is not giving up on its inorganic growth strategy either, considering that for the first time since 2006, the company has managed a cash-pile of over Rs 300 crore. &ldquo;If we have an opportunity, we would certainly put money behind that,&rdquo; mentions Batra. Now, whether that is something to cheer or worry about, only time will tell.&nbsp;</p>', 'Pidilite is well-entrenched in sealants and adhesives, but is on a sticky wicket when it comes to industrial and overseas busineses', '37', '', 0, '', 'can-pidilite-keep-blowing-its-trumpet-402', 396, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Can Pidilite keep blowing its trumpet?', 'Pidilite is well-entrenched in sealants and adhesives, but is on a sticky wicket when it comes to industrial and overseas busineses', '', '', '', 'Pidilite,Fevistick,Fevicol,Rangeela paints,Fevikwik', 0, NULL, '2015-02-03 18:32:53', '2015-02-03 19:17:08', '2013-10-12', 0),
(403, 16, '', 'Long lasting?', '<p class="p1"><span class="s1">R</span>emember the news item a few years ago about a young Indian man who sued Hindustan Unilever (HUL) over an ineffective Axe effect? The report said that Vaibhav Bedi was accusing the FMCG giant of cheating him and causing anguish since, despite using the deodorant for seven years, he had been unable to attract a single girl. The report went viral and was even printed in several mainstream newspapers across the world before it was revealed as a hoax that had originally appeared on a news parody website. The news may have been fake, but there are perhaps thousands of young men who empathise with the fictitious Bedi &mdash; after all, it&rsquo;s not only Axe that has been hardselling the idea that smelling good is all it takes to attract women by the droves. And, going by the rising sales of deodorants, there are probably hundreds of thousands who have bought into the idea willingly &mdash; what level of success they&rsquo;ve had, though, is anybody&rsquo;s guess.</p>\n<p class="p3">The Axe effect has been particularly potent in India, where men&rsquo;s deodorants account for a staggering 70% of the Rs 1,886-crore market. Virtually all men&rsquo;s deo brands run advertisements that show women going crazy for any man after getting just a whiff of whatever he has sprayed on. Simple logic would suggest that copycat advertising is perhaps not the best way to stand out in a cramped market where 500 brands are jostling for space. So, what explains the strong smell of success in the Indian deodorants market?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Coming of age</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">According to a recent Euromonitor report, from just Rs 283 crore in 2007, sales of deodorants in India grew five-fold to Rs 1,520 crore in 2012, a compounded annual growth rate of 39.9% (<em>see: Smells good</em>). The explosive pace of growth will taper off in the coming years as the market matures, says the research firm, but will still grow at a very respectable 15%, and double to Rs 3,010 crore by 2017. Compare that with the overall personal care category of the FMCG sector, which has been growing at 17% in the past six years and is expected to clock 18% growth in the near future. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t many categories that offer the kind of growth deodorants do,&rdquo; agrees MS Raghunandan, CEO, Jyothy Laboratories, which owns the Fa range of deodorants courtesy the buyout of Henkel&rsquo;s brands in India in 2011. &ldquo;Not much was happening in Fa. But we have activated the brand in the past one year and the results have been encouraging,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Smells good - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s not just Jyothy with Fa. In addition to its blockbuster Axe, HUL has deodorants under the Dove, Lux, Sure and Rexona brands. Marico acquired Set Wet and Zatak brands from Reckitt Benckiser in 2012 for its entry into the deodorants space; Wipro Consumer launched the Yardley brand in 2010 after acquiring it from its British parent; and ITC unveiled the Engage range in May 2013. Everybody wants to get into the game, right from companies engaged in producing TV programmes, manufacturing condoms and homoeopathy products to sports personalities. Not to mention relatively unknown players who have launched brands such as 18, Killer, Fuel, Addiction, Bad Boi, Layers, Secret Temptation, Intense, Fogg, Streax Xenoh and several more.</p>\n<p class="p3">And all this over the past five years. What makes deodorants smell good to so many companies? &ldquo;It is one of the faster growing categories within personal care. Considering the low penetration levels, low entry barriers and increased affluence and disposable incomes, more and more players are entering this category,&rdquo; says Sunil Gadgil, marketing director, Nivea India, which is the fourth-largest player in the deodorant market with a 5.2% share. (<em>see: All pumped up</em>)</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>All pumped up - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The numbers bear out the under-penetration claim. Vijay Udasi, executive director, Nielsen India, says penetration at the household level is barely 5%. And if just one in 20 Indian homes buys deodorant, the usage levels must be even lower since only one or two family members are likely to use deos. (In the US, in comparison, deodorant use is as high as 91%.) &ldquo;On the distribution side, there are 8.4 million stores in India, but deodorants sell at just 840,000 &mdash; that is, just 10%.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Considering the low penetration levels, low entry barriers and increased affluence, more players are entering this category" - Sunil Gadgil, marketing director, Nivea India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">At the same time, there is a perceptible change in consumer behaviour in the past decade, with brand awareness increasing and personal grooming becoming a necessity more than just a desirable habit. &ldquo;There is a focus now on outside beauty and grooming that aids confidence. A young population and workforce, greater social interactions and rising incomes have all favoured it,&rdquo; adds Udasi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">For brand owners, too, deodorants make business sense. Most manufacturing is outsourced and accounts for about 40% of the retail price; distribution and marketing accounts for another 40%, leaving a very attractive margin of 20%. &ldquo;Where 10 years ago, soaps or creams were driving growth for FMCG companies, today, deodorants are driving the growth,&rdquo; says Anand Ramanathan, associate director, KPMG. Besides, he says, it may be easier to launch a deodorant brand, which is a relatively new category, than to break into a mature market such as shaving cream or talcum powder. But launching a new deo is far easier than overcoming the barriers to growth in a cluttered market.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>What&rsquo;s driving growth</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">&ldquo;Impulse, I suppose,&rdquo; says Mukesh Bisht, a 32-year-old Delhi-based government consultant, explaining how he buys deodorant. In the past two years alone, he has tried Set Wet, Wild Stone, Nivea and Park Avenue but can&rsquo;t pinpoint what triggered the impulse. Bisht is a very typical deodorant consumer, says the industry. There is little or no brand stickiness, near perfect competition and most purchases are made on the spur of the moment. &ldquo;It is a flirtatious category,&rdquo; concedes Anil Kulkarni, business director for Park Avenue at JK Helene Curtis. Which makes it very difficult to build loyalty and grow the consumer base.</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s not the only hurdle. Deodorants are an urban phenomenon and even in the cities, have a strong rival in talcum powder, which, as the Euromonitor report says, is &ldquo;comparatively affordable and... preferred by many consumers across the country&rdquo;. Darshanbhai Patel, a veteran of sorts in the deo business, agrees. &ldquo;Deodorants have become commoditised in India. About 75% of business is done in the top 20 cities where customers are always looking for new things.&rdquo; Patel, who helped launch Set Wet and Zatak under Paras Pharma (the brands were sold to Reckitt Benckiser in 2011, which sold them to Marico a year later), is the founder of the Ahmedabad-based Vini Cosmetics, which owns the Fogg brand of deodorants. &ldquo;There is very little a brand can do to differentiate itself,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>&nbsp;"Deodrants have become commoditised in India. About 75% of the business is in 20 cities where people are looking for new things" - Darshanbhai Patel, founder, Vini Cosmetics</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Not quite true, says KPMG&rsquo;s Ramanathan, pointing to three distinct layers in the market. &ldquo;At the top are international brands catering to urban customers. Next are mass Indian brands and then low-priced alternatives for tier 1 and tier 2 cities,&rdquo; he says. But within each band, pricing is competitive and similar: imported labels such as Ferrari, Hugo Boss and United Colors of Benetton sell for about Rs 800 per 150 ml, while mass brands such as Axe, Fogg, Park Avenue retail at between Rs 150 and Rs 200 for similar-sized cans; at the bottom are brands such as Explore, Eva and Gatsby for Rs 100 per can. Even market leader HUL has six deodorants catering to different customer groups at different price points. Despite that, the competition has taken a toll: between 2008 and 2012, the FMCG giant has lost nearly 9% market share. &ldquo;The size of market has grown during this period, creating opportunities for new players, but it has become fragmented. So, in a much larger but fragmented market, HUL has lost some share, but gained in absolute terms,&rdquo; says Ankur Bisen, vice-president, retail, Technopak. The drop in market share notwithstanding, Axe is still the market leader by a huge margin (26.8%, compared with McNroe Chemicals&rsquo; Wild Stone, which is at second place with 10.7%). And the market has taken its cues from the leader.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Racy to the top</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">A couple of years ago, the Advertising Standards Council of India pulled up a few brands for their racy ad campaigns. That doesn&rsquo;t seem to have made much of a difference. Most men&rsquo;s deodorants in India still follow Axe&rsquo;s spray-this-and-become-a-babe-magnet positioning. That won&rsquo;t work for too long, warn market observers. &ldquo;The category is still in its growth phase and the target is the youth. So, all the intangibles such as sex appeal and being accepted in society are being talked about. But we need to transition to highlighting the functional benefits of the products,&rdquo; says Ramanathan.</p>\n<p class="p3">Already, the deodorant category is &ldquo;over-advertised&rdquo;, says Harminder Sahni, founder of brand consultancy Vazir. &ldquo;If one brand starts spending, the others feel compelled to follow. But most of the ads are highly sexist and while ads help a brand get noticed, people may not be asking for the brand by name,&rdquo; he says, pointing to the contradictions in the market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">So, what works? &ldquo;Fast innovation and a sense of newness,&rdquo; says Sameer Sathpathy, executive vice-president, marketing, Marico. And new markets. Since taking over Set Wet and Zatak in July 2012, Marico has been slowly pushing the latter in rural markets, with focused advertising and leveraging its distribution and marketing muscle. &ldquo;Our advertising is different from the boy-chasing-girl and vice versa route. We are focusing instead on competition between men.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Our advertising is different from the boy-chasing-girl and vice versa route. We are focusing instead on competition between men" - Sameer Sathpathy, executive VP, marketing, Marico</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Much more is needed to grow the market, says brand consultant Kiran Khalap, founder of chlorophyll. &ldquo;Given that we are a hot, crowded country, this category should have grown much faster,&rdquo; he says. Traditionally, the task of converting non-category users lies with the market leader. In toothpaste, Colgate would routinely address black toothpowder users through its white toothpowder, the idea being that they would gradually upgrade to white toothpaste, gel toothpaste and mouthwash. Surf converted washing soap users to detergents using similar tactics. But, &ldquo;I have not seen any deo brand attempting conversion,&rdquo; points out Khalap.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Even if creating new users is still to be addressed, some firms are trying to break free of the Axe effect. Vini Chemicals&rsquo; Fogg is a case in point &mdash; and its differentiated positioning has won it appreciation not just from analysts but even industry people. Instead of pushing the fragrance or its appeal with the opposite sex, ads for Fogg emphasise the get-your-money&rsquo;s-worth angle (at Rs 170, the deo is priced slightly higher than other mass brands). Fogg is liquid, not gas, which means there is no wastage, say the ads, &ldquo;guaranteeing&rdquo; 800 sprays per can. &ldquo;If you are not differentiated, it is difficult to survive. Look at how a new brand such as Fogg has differentiated itself. As a result, it has come to the top of the table in just two to three years,&rdquo; says Raghunandan of Jyothy Laboratories.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But then there are some with quirky differences too. For example, there is the Mumbai-based Eternal Personal Care, which launched Bad Boi deodorants in May 2013. Six variants have been launched and the differentiator is not the names, which are the usual deo-sounding Envy, Dash, Ace, Rave and so on. Instead, the company emphasises the unique sound the can makes when opened. &ldquo;We have stressed that in our television ads also where girls tease the boy with that sound,&rdquo; says SM Menon, co-founder and managing director, Eternal Personal Care.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Ironically, HUL itself hasn&rsquo;t replicated the Axe positioning for its other deo brands. While Denim is portrayed as a value-for-money brand, new launch Sure stresses the product&rsquo;s anti-perspirant qualities more, claiming that the deo is effective even at 58 degrees C. In a limited response to queries, HUL indicated its strategy as broadening its portfolio by extending existing brands and covering all segments of the market. &ldquo;Deodorants is an important category for HUL and over a period of time, as the market has evolved, we have added brands and benefits in the portfolio to meet the diverse consumer needs. HUL has led the market development for the category by straddling the pyramid,&rdquo; says a statement from the company.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Advertising in women&rsquo;s deos, however, mainly emphasises functional aspects &mdash; and that&rsquo;s true not just for HUL but other brands as well. Nivea, for instance, has been pushing its variant as an underarm skin-whitener, a stand HUL copied for Dove, when it extended the brand into deodorants in 2011. &ldquo;There is lack of differentiation in the male deo category. But in women&rsquo;s deos, we have a very differentiated product offering with our underarm whitening spray, which we pioneered in the Indian market,&rdquo; says Nivea&rsquo;s Gadgil. And it&rsquo;s making a difference, he adds, claiming to have gained 1.3% market share in the past 12 months. Then, there&rsquo;s the May 2013 campaign for Fa; it showcases a simple benefit of using deodorants: removing body odour. Perhaps if more advertisements spoke about that basic aspect of deodorants, selling more cans, even in a crowded market, wouldn&rsquo;t be so hard.&nbsp;</p>', 'The rising popularity of the deodrant segment has drawn names big and small, but only a handful will thrive', '9', '', 0, '', 'long-lasting-403', 397, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Long lasting?', 'The rising popularity of the deodrant segment has drawn names big and small, but only a handful will thrive', '', '', '', 'Deodrants,FMCG,Personal care', 0, NULL, '2015-02-03 19:29:33', '2015-02-03 20:12:23', '2013-10-12', 0),

(405, 20, '', 'What the charts don''t foretell', '<p class="p1">The reaction of a widely-read pink paper, when it screamed &ldquo;Band, Baaja, Bernanke!&rdquo; to capture the 600-point rally in the Sensex, following the US Federal Reserve&rsquo;s decision to continue with the stimulus package, seemed to suggest the worst was over for Indian equities. But after hitting a three-year closing high of 20,647 on September 19, the euphoria didn&rsquo;t last for long as the benchmark fell 700 points (4%) to 19,920 on September 24. The slide was largely on account of a surprise hike in the repo rate by the new Reserve Bank of India governor, Raghuram Rajan, who continued the hardline approach taken by his predecessor towards combating stubborn inflation.</p>\n<p class="p3">Also, with GDP growth in FY13 dropping sharply to 5%, the lowest since FY03, and Q1FY14 growth, too, falling to 4.4%, marking three consecutive quarters of sub-5% growth, the outlook for the markets seems far from rosy. Already, net sales growth for the Sensex constituents has decelerated in the first quarter of the current fiscal to 1.7% y-o-y &mdash; the lowest since the global financial crisis in 2008 &mdash; and is a confirmation that the numbers in the coming quarters will only look worse.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Not surprisingly, the 30-share Sensex has shown largely flat return at 1.73% YTD, while the mid-cap index is down 23% for the same period. Similarly, the 50-share Nifty is down 1% and the CNX mid-cap is down 19%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But, interestingly, the disparity between the two indices is not as stark when it comes to valuation gap (<em>see: Picture in contrast</em>). According to Gautam Trivedi, MD and head of equities, India, Religare Capital Markets, &ldquo;There is currently no appetite for mid caps and the disconnect visible in the charts is largely because some heavyweight stocks in the mid-cap index are enjoying a higher valuation multiple.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s true. If one were to exclude big names such as RCom, Godrej Consumer Products and Adani Enterprises, which are currently trading at higher multiples of 28-35 times one-year forward earnings, the picture would look very different.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Picture in contrast - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Concurring with Trivedi is Manish Bhandari, managing partner and CEO, Vallum Capital Advisors, who believes price-to-book multiple (P/BV) is the best way to capture the market&rsquo;s outlook towards large and mid caps. &ldquo;PE [price to earnings] is not influenced by distribution of dividend, as dividend is after tax, whereas P/BV is influenced by how much dividend is paid since book value is all about retained earnings.&rdquo; Indeed, the P/BV chart clearly shows the gap.</p>\n<p class="p3">Going ahead, the consensus on the Street is that with markets expected to stay volatile in the near future, there will be a polarisation towards larger caps. &ldquo;Given the current environment, I see a further downside in the markets by 10% and, that being the case, mid caps could get a further drubbing,&rdquo; adds Trivedi. <span class="s2"><br /></span></p>', 'The skewed weightage of some select stocks is distorting the valuation gap between large and mid caps ', '5', '', 0, '', 'what-the-charts-dont-foretell-405', 399, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'What the charts don''t foretell', 'The skewed weightage of some select stocks is distorting the valuation gap between large and mid caps ', '', '', '', '', 0, NULL, '2015-02-03 20:24:33', '2015-02-05 11:44:25', '2013-10-12', 0);

(406, 20, '', 'Sitting pretty', '<p class="p1">Kishor Patil can&rsquo;t help but gush over <em>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</em>, the 2011 Bollywood flick about three friends who live life to the fullest. &ldquo;The pinnacle of the movie is the bull run [scene]. It is sometimes very important to just take the plunge. If you believe in yourself, you will not only come out victorious but you will have stronger determination and confidence in your capabilities,&rdquo; says the managing director of Pune-based IT company KPIT Technologies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s easy to see why the 51-year-old identifies with that scene. Over 20 years ago, Patil and Ravi Pandit, now chairman of KPIT Technologies, took a bold plunge when they moved away from their chartered accountancy backgrounds to start an IT services business. Over the years, they managed to scale it up to a multi-million dollar company, aided along the way by carefully thought-out acquisitions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Earlier this month, KPIT Cummins Infosystems went in for a makeover. The company dropped Cummins from its name, adopted a new logo and rechristened itself as KPIT Technologies to reflect the upcoming changes in its business model. While Cummins continues to be its top client and one of its strategic partners, the name change is more reflective of how the company has grown beyond its key customer, with plans to grow its technology business &mdash; which develops patented products and solutions &mdash; to bring in half of its revenues over the next couple of years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The technology business currently accounts for a third of revenues, while business IT accounts for the balance. KPIT has invested in developing products and solutions in embedded software and auto electronics. The move is also to consolidate operations across its acquired companies and bring more consistency across its offerings to clients as a single brand as it sets its eyes on a higher target. &ldquo;By 2017, we hope to become a $1-billion company by revenues, and we wanted a new identity that would reflect our bold and aggressive thinking,&rdquo; says Patil.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Stable fare - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Early on in its journey, its 2002 acquisition of the IT arm of Cummins Inc, which now holds around 6%, defined the company&rsquo;s roadmap. Through this journey, KPIT realised that while competing with larger companies on deals is a challenge by itself, taking them on in areas where they have built a strong foothold, such as banking and financial services or healthcare, was even tougher. It, therefore, decided to focus on three verticals where it could carve a niche: automotive and transportation, manufacturing and energy and utilities. These three verticals today bring in 86% of overall revenues. (<em>see: Stable fare</em>) The company sold its financial services business, which accounted for about 3-4% of revenues, to Infrasoft Technologies in 2011 to focus on its core verticals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong> Inorganic push</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Since 2002, KPIT has relied on acquisitions to fill the gaps in its services offerings and build competencies in automotive electronics, engineering design services and enterprise resource planning (ERP). &ldquo;In the fast-changing world of technology, time to market is critical and companies can&rsquo;t develop capabilities organically at all times. KPIT has not only filled gaps in its offerings but also managed to stay ahead in its chosen area of expertise with the help of these acquisitions,&rdquo; points out Amit Bhatiani, partner at CX Partners, a private equity firm that picked up a stake in the company in 2012.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"KPIT has managed to stay ahead in its chosen area of expertise with the help of acquisitions" - Amit Bhatiani, partner, CX Partners</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">For instance, in 2009, the company took over US-based Sparta Consulting, which specialises in SAP software-led consulting, for $38 million, to strengthen its SAP practice, which now brings in nearly 30% of revenues. Since 2002, the company has spent over $85 million on 10 acquisitions to strengthen its portfolio (<em>see: Acquired strength</em>), with the latest coming in 2011, when it picked up a 50% stake for Rs 103 crore in Mumbai-based Systime (which provides Oracle consulting services for manufacturing and energy and utilities companies) to expand its ERP consulting and services business.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Acquired strength - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">These acquisitions have helped the company sustain a strong growth momentum as well. Vishal Agarwal, analyst with Jefferies India, mentions in his report that KPIT&rsquo;s revenues have grown over 41% in dollar terms over the past decade. While acquiring companies is one thing, scaling them up is a whole different ballgame, as many acquisitions tend to falter at the integration stage. But KPIT has successfully managed to scale up its revenues in the companies it has taken over. For instance, it has scaled up revenues of Sparta Consulting from $25 million at the time of acquisition to $72 million in 2013. CG Smith, a US-based company that specialises in auto electronics, saw its revenues grow from $6.25 million in 2006, when it was acquired, to $45 million in 2013. Similarly, the company managed to scale up revenues of Cummins Infotech from a modest $1 million in 2002 to $66 million in 2013. More importantly, over the years, the company managed to reduce its dependence on Cummins, which contributed a high 40% in FY09, to 19% in FY13. Increasing non-Cummins revenues has been possible because it has managed to mine its client accounts better compared with peers such as Mindtree and Hexaware. With over 40% of its clients generating over $1 million each in revenues, at $2.3 million, the company&rsquo;s average revenue per client is better than its peers. (<em>see: More per client</em>)</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>More per client - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Also, multiple acquisitions have not burdened the balance sheet; while gross debt is around Rs 360 crore, cash on books is around Rs 400 crore. &ldquo;While we have been acquiring companies at a faster pace than our peers, we have been cautious with our acquisitions so as to not risk our balance sheet,&rdquo; says Patil, who feels that the financial background of the company&rsquo;s promoters has helped them understand the risks that come with acquisitions better. The company&rsquo;s acquisitions were funded by a mix of debt and equity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">However, according to Agarwal&rsquo;s report, while operational cash flows generated by the business remain strong, the payout on its acquisitions has impacted free cash flows, which have been negative over the past three years. The company is expected to pay around $25 million in FY14 as payout for its acquisitions, but analysts expect the free cash flows to turn positive this year. Patil is not too perturbed since the company&rsquo;s operational flows continue to be consistent and they have been able to raise funds through debt and equity whenever needed. For instance, ChrysCapital, along with CX Partners, invested around Rs 162 crore in December 2012. ChrysCap first picked up an 8.9% stake in the company for Rs 110 crore in 2011. The PE firm now has a 15.6% stake in the company with CX Partners, which has a 5.74% stake in KPIT for Rs 64.8 crore. &ldquo;We like the fact that the promoters chose to build a differentiated business model focusing on niche verticals and have been able to build a team that has delivered on execution consistently,&rdquo; says Bhatiani.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">However, since most acquisitions have been overseas, operating margins have taken a hit, falling from 22% in 2010 to 16% in 2013. The margins fell while the share of on-site revenues increased from 44% in 2010 to 54% in 2013, as the acquired companies were integrated into KPIT. The company expects margins to stabilise at 18% in the next couple of years, while guiding for an improvement of 50 basis points in FY14, driven by operational efficiencies and partly by a weak rupee.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>On a high</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">KPIT has guided for revenues of $465-475 million, a growth of around 14-16% y-o-y, for FY14 and earnings growth of 16-20%. While there are concerns that its top client, Cummins (19% revenue contribution), and the SAP business may not contribute much to FY14 growth, the management remains confident of reaching that target as it expects demand to recover in the second half of the year. &ldquo;Yes, the environment is challenging, but we are sure there are enough growth opportunities that will help us meet the target,&rdquo; says Patil.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">As for its $1-billion target, the company believes that its specialisation will help scale up revenues. The big opportunity is in automotive technology, where there is a growing use of electronics in vehicles. Automobile companies are increasingly investing on making cars built on better technology. In fact, IT spending on manufacturing is estimated to be around $482 billion in 2013 and the IT spend on utilities is estimated to be around $138 billion in 2013, according to a company report. The company is already the largest third-party auto electronics vendor in India, working with nine out of 12 auto OEMs, and believes its products such as the yet-to-be-launched Revolo could accelerate revenue growth in a non-linear fashion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Manufactured and marketed through a joint venture between KPIT and Bharat Forge, Revolo is a plug-in hybrid solution that helps vehicles become more fuel-efficient. Trials are currently being conducted on a smaller set of vehicles and results have shown more than 25% energy savings, over 35% reduction in fuel consumption and over 30% reduction in emissions. While the company awaits approval for large-scale trials, it is hopeful of launching the product first in India next year, where it believes there will be many takers, before addressing other markets. Both partners have invested #10 crore in the venture. For now, though, analysts are not factoring in any revenues for the product.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While Revolo is a work in progress, Patil expects growth to be spread out across the year. &ldquo;We have built a robust deal pipeline in the US and Asia-Pacific, making us confident of stronger growth and profit performance in FY14. Going ahead, the objective is to concentrate on deal closures and convert the pipeline into revenues,&rdquo; Patil told analysts during a post Q1FY14 concall. KPIT plans to cross-sell its capabilities in Oracle, SAP and the automotive space through its newly-formed business transformation unit (which also offers consulting services) to create larger deals focusing on its top 50 customers.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Sound bet</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">At 10 times estimated FY14 earnings, the stock is trading at a discount of 20% and 40% to peers Hexaware and Mindtree, respectively. The discount has largely been on account of the equity dilution to fund acquisitions. According to a report by IDFC Securities, KPIT had diluted around 23% of its equity over the past five years. This is much higher than the 9% and 2%, respectively, for Mindtree and Hexaware. Hitesh Shah, director, equity research, IDFC Securities, though, qualifies the observation. &ldquo;Strong revenue growth and healthy margins have offset the effect of equity dilution on EPS growth,&rdquo; he says. KPIT managed to achieve an earnings growth of 26.5% over the past five years, compared with Mindtree (24.5%) and Hexaware (23.2%). So its consistent performance should help bridge the gap in the coming years.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"Whether they reach the $1-billion milestone depends on the macro environment, but their vision shows hunger for growth" - Hitesh Shah, director, equity research, IDFC Securities&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Analysts believe that the stock is attractively valued given its growth prospects. &ldquo;KPIT management has delivered strong growth. Whether they reach the $1-billion milestone or not depends on the macro environment, but their vision shows hunger for growth and that is what we like about them,&rdquo; adds IDFC&rsquo;s Shah, who has given an outperformer rating on the stock.</p>\n<p class="p3">While the company may not really benefit to a large extent from rupee depreciation due to its higher proportion of on-site revenues (54%), its consistent track record and niche specialisation does make it a stand-out candidate in the mid-cap IT space. Given the company&rsquo;s growth prospects, the stock could make for a good long-term investment at current levels.&nbsp;</p>', 'KPIT''s niche business model and attractive valuation make it a sound bet', '6', '', 0, '', 'sitting-pretty-406', 400, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Sitting pretty', 'KPIT''s niche business model and attractive valuation make it a sound bet', '', '', '', 'KPIT Technologies', 0, NULL, '2015-02-05 11:45:33', '2015-02-05 12:16:22', '2013-10-12', 0),

(408, 24, '', 'Picture perfect', '<p class="p1">His sights are set on the Canon 5D, but P Nandagopal, MD and CEO, IndiaFirst Life Insurance, still vividly remembers the first professional camera he used. &ldquo;It was a Yashica model that a college friend had bought. I learnt all the basics of photography &mdash; aperture, focal length, film speed, shutter speed &mdash; from him, and together we became the unofficial photographers for college events, attending any functions as we pleased, just playing around with the camera,&rdquo; Nandagopal recalls. Now, as the 53-year-old former Reliance Life CEO expertly pulls out and assembles professional photographic equipment from the cabinets of his spacious suburban Mumbai apartment, he betrays a more than amateur interest in the subject.</p>\n<p class="p3">Over time, Nandagopal&rsquo;s early dabbling in photography and filmmaking has developed into a full-blown interest. From his father&rsquo;s 35 mm Kodak film camera, he has graduated to the Canon 40D for still photography and a Sony videocamera for short films. But the motivation to shoot remains the same &mdash; to look at the world from a different perspective. &ldquo;I think all photographs have to tell a story. I don&rsquo;t like taking tourist-y pictures &mdash; seeing the world&rsquo;s beauty through the viewfinder restricts your perspective. To take good pictures, you need to slow down, soak in the mood of the place and not go by a set agenda. Perhaps then something might catch your interest,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Fittingly, Nandagopal&rsquo;s camera kit travels with him only to places he&rsquo;s exploring for the first time &mdash; the beaches of Rio, Tanzania&rsquo;s rolling grasslands and, later this month, Mexico&rsquo;s rugged landscapes. &ldquo;I take it along only if I&rsquo;m travelling alone, otherwise I have to spar with my family about the space taken up by it and time spent taking photos,&rdquo; he laughs. Given that he owns an 80-400 mm telephoto lens, several macro and wide-angle lenses, a dolly, trolley and even studio lights, it certainly isn&rsquo;t just an extra suitcase they&rsquo;re often arguing over.</p>\n<p class="p3">However, time for vacations is hard to come by for the busy insurance professional. How, then, does he keep his passion for the camera alive? &ldquo;As a child, I used to watch and analyse films with family and friends. Now, my family and I keep that tradition alive by analysing every movie we watch, and keep adding to our 600-700-strong DVD collection. I also follow online courses by Sony and Canon and read scripts and screenplays to understand filmmaking,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Nandagopal, who used to write for AIR Yuva Vani in school, now participates in company filmmaking events to keep experimenting with the medium. Though he doesn&rsquo;t upload photos to any social media accounts, he has had to revisit that position of late, after his photo albums got washed away in a minor mishap at home. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learnt my lesson and keep backups of my photos now. Though I haven&rsquo;t thought about exhibiting my work, I do want to collate it into a scrapbook of sorts and make a full-length film someday,&rdquo; he says. Unfulfilled ambitions of becoming a filmmaker? &ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; he chuckles, &ldquo;But the moment I fulfil that dream, the motive to create new work will disappear. It is much better to keep learning.&rdquo;</p>', 'P Nandagopal, managing director and CEO, IndiaFirst Life insurance, on how photography and filmmaking have altered his perspective on life ', '12', '', 0, '', 'picture-perfect-408', 402, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Picture perfect ', 'P Nandagopal, managing director and CEO, Indiafirst Life insurance, on how photography and filmmaking have altered his perspective on life ', '', '', '', 'P Nandagopal,IndiaFirst Life Insurance,Photography,Filmmaking', 0, NULL, '2015-02-05 12:22:35', '2015-02-05 12:31:19', '2013-10-12', 0),

Ask a client, and you would get a different answer entirely. For the most part, clients didn&rsquo;t seem to care, or they even felt sympathetic. Despite a slight drop-off in 2009 due to the global financial crisis, the business continued to hold up relatively well in the face of the scandal. Even Walmart, which for years disdained consultants, had brought McKinsey on board at the end of the decade. McKinsey&rsquo;s revenues actually <em>grew</em> by 9% in 2010 &mdash; second in the industry only to PricewaterhouseCoopers. The firm hired 2,000 people in 2010.</p>\n<p class="p3">Loyal clients includes companies that were clients of Anil Kumar himself. In 2009, for example, Tim Flynn, chairman and CEO of accounting and advisory firm KPMG, was in the midst of formalising a project with McKinsey. On Wednesday, October 14, Kumar spoke to the board of KPMG. The next morning Flynn and Kumar had breakfast. And the next morning Kumar was arrested. But like many McKinsey clients, Flynn apparently subscribes to the &ldquo;bad apples&rdquo; theory: Every organisation has them, and the thing that&rsquo;s important is that once they&rsquo;re discovered, you do your best to make sure there aren&rsquo;t any more. KPMG decided to work with the firm despite the controversy.</p>\n<p class="p3">Peter Grauer, chairman of Bloomberg LP, expressed a similar sentiment. He first encountered McKinsey around 2006, when he asked the consultants to help chart a future for the financial information provider&rsquo;s domestic television business. Bloomberg adopted a series of McKinsey&rsquo;s recommendations in 2008, including bringing in proven talent &mdash; like network television veteran Andy Lack.</p>\n<p class="p3">McKinsey also helped Bloomberg assess its strategy for an expansion into legal information through a new product, Bloomberg Law... The consultants then moved on to a similar project on Bloomberg Government. Neither effort had been a resounding success through 2012, but, once again, the client is reluctant to pin any shortcomings on McKinsey&hellip;</p>\n<p class="p3">The firm&rsquo;s intellectual output continued to win raves as well. In mid-2010 Dominic Barton was meeting with Francis Mer, former minister of finance in France and then-chairman of French conglomerate Safran. Mer had read McKinsey&rsquo;s January 2010 report, titled &ldquo;Debt and Deleveraging: The Global Credit Bubble and Its Economic Consequences.&rdquo; Mer told Barton that it was the single best piece of research he&rsquo;d read in five years.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Can I give you some feedback?&rdquo; he asked Barton. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t market yourself out of a paper bag. Why didn&rsquo;t you take this report around to every single finance minister in Europe and force them to read it?&rdquo; This was ignoring the obvious reason for McKinsey&rsquo;s retreat from active outreach. Since the arrest of Kumar and the rumours about Gupta, the firm had leaned back on its most cherished of public relations strategies: It had closed ranks. It was still pitching to clients, but McKinsey wasn&rsquo;t in a chest-thumping mode in 2010.</p>\n<p class="p3">Despite the media frenzy over the insider trading scandal, the actual damage to McKinsey&rsquo;s reputation remained unclear...McKinsey&rsquo;s Thursday night party at the Belvedere Hotel during the World Economic Forum in Davos is still considered the best event of the week.

Researchers <strong>Susan Athey</strong>, <strong>Emilio Calvano</strong> and <strong>Joshua Gans</strong> created an experimental model to see how readers interact with ad content across media. The results of the experiment mirror the changes in the print ad market with the coming of the internet, they say. Some significant conclusions were that with readers being able to switch between media, advertising revenues fall across board. Also, using tracking software (like cookies on the Internet) to gauge reader interests doesn&rsquo;t contribute much towards raising revenues or ad prices.

Though the Nifty might yo-yo, the streak of optimism is creating positive vibes. The result? With crowds of shoppers thronging Palladium in Mumbai and DLF Emporio in New Delhi, Diwali this year seems set for a Cavalli makeover. So, if you&rsquo;ve been holding on to your purse strings, here are 10 reasons for you to blow that stash instead of hoarding it:</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;<strong>It&rsquo;s good for the economy&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Everyone knows this, right? The more money there is in the market, the more it remains in circulation, the better things are for everyone. Stop sulking and go spend that moolah you&rsquo;ve been stashing away. It&rsquo;ll make you feel good, your kids will love you, and a diamond really is your wife&rsquo;s best friend.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>Time to book that luxury home&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Think back to the last few years, when all real estate ads were about &ldquo;affordable&rdquo; housing. That phase seems to be petering out, with high-end, designer homes coming back to command the market. This is especially true in Mumbai, where the Lodha Group is creating iconic living complexes with Giorgio Armani, Jade Jagger and others, and Aishwarya Rai is batting for villas by the sea. Why now? Because everyone and their aunt will tell you that the prices are low. And if the savings on a 6,000 sq ft designer apartment add up to a few crores, it&rsquo;s worth it for the monies you will want to spend on your Porthault linen and Limoges porcelain. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>When times are lean, fashion is fun</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Fortunately, all the leading designers seem to have had the same idea, so whether it&rsquo;s Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Dolce &amp; Gabbana or Roberto Cavalli, men&rsquo;s jackets are seriously wacky, with prints in jacquard and satin.

Reliance Equity Advisors declined to participate in the story, but some signs are unmistakable. First, Khadim makes a good target &mdash; with 650 retail stores across India, its footprint is second only to the ubiquitous Bata; and sales have been rising steadily, from Rs 180 crore in FY08 to Rs 320 crore in FY12 and Rs 420 crore last year. Second, the industry is growing well. The Rs 22,000-crore Indian footwear industry is expected to touch Rs 38,700 crore by 2015 and since only 40% is organised, the potential for growth seems immense.</p>\n<p class="p3">But then, the industry has been regularly clocking 15%-plus growth rates for several years. So, why are investors warming up only now? The Khadim investment is the second PE deal in the footwear market this year: in April 2013, Future Ventures picked up a 33% stake in KFC Shoemaker, which retails under the Tresmode brand. &ldquo;PEs look at certain scale and size before investing, which I think firms are now displaying in this sector,&rdquo; reasons Saloni Nangia, president, Technopak Advisors. As for Reliance&rsquo;s interest in Khadim, &ldquo;everything is attractive about Khadim&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It has a proven scalable model and is vertically integrated, which is rare in this business. And it operates in a high-margin category.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Roy Burman doesn&rsquo;t agree that the footwear industry has been flying under the PE radar all this while. &ldquo;The PE community was always tracking potential investments&nbsp;in the segment. We had enquiries from various funds at different point of time. However, investors are wary about the retail segment in India, thanks to governmental policies and past experience of bad investment,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Until now, Khadim&rsquo;s growth has been funded by debt and internal accruals. But Roy Burman felt equity infusion was imperative for future growth &mdash; &ldquo;Otherwise the balance sheet would be over-leveraged and skewed towards debt.&rdquo; Under the terms of the deal with Reliance, the shoemaker is bound to provide an exit option after 42 months.

CCD would create a special beverage, KS Mojo, aimed at youngsters in the 18-22 age group, a key component of the brand&rsquo;s target audience. It worked even better than the company anticipated and the runaway success of the cold mocha prompted the company to look at the category a little more keenly. &ldquo;It was clear the KS brand had huge potential and we could certainly look at entering new categories.

Still, in the past 18 months since its launch, Notty has sold over 120,000 units, while the far-newer Lounge Myx has sold nearly 48,000 units. &ldquo;The idea right now is to increase visibility,&rdquo; he explains, counting on the drinks&rsquo; unique positioning to help achieve that. &ldquo;There were very obvious opportunities in both these segments. With Lounge Myx, the consumer can fix a cocktail at home, while Notty has vitamins to boost immunity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The idea is to increase. There were very obvious opportunities in these [cocktail mixers, kids'' drinks] segments" - Vinod Gaikwad, general manager and sales, Greenways Foods &amp; Beverages</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">With no direct competition in either segment, pricing isn&rsquo;t an issue. At Rs 75 for a 250-ml can, the mixer is positioned as a premium product (although it&rsquo;s still much cheaper than imported mixers, which retail at over Rs 200 for a 300-ml can in upmarket stores). (<em>see: A distinct&nbsp; flavour</em>) But where Notty costs Rs 35 for a 250-ml can, a Rs 20 tetrapak version is to be launched shortly. &ldquo;It will be impossible to increase penetration otherwise. My drink needs to be a substitute for junk food,&rdquo; he says firmly. From 20 cities currently, by December, the juice will be available in 27 cities, helping it increase the number of outlets from 15,000 to 59,000.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Lounge Myx and Notty are currently at the soft launch stage, and efforts are on to promote both. So far, marketing for Notty has been restricted to images of hit cartoon character Chhota Bheem adorning the cans, which are replicated in posters and danglers at retail outlets. Now, the company is planning celebrity endorsements for both the brands and go the mass media route by end-December.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>A distinct flavour - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">A brand ambassador is likely to make a big dent in Notty&rsquo;s budget for the year. Typically, manufacturing costs are negligible in the beverages business. &ldquo;The big expenditure goes into promotion, where events and celebrities are used extensively,&rdquo; confirms Manajit Ghoshal, group CEO, Viiking Ventures, which sells the XXX energy drink brand. XXX was launched in August 2013 with three variants. The company has signed on porn star Sunny Leone as brand ambassador; so far, her involvement has been restricted to point-of-sale branding and B2B event sponsorships, but a full marketing campaign complete with TVCs is planned for December-January. &ldquo;This is a high-end category and the opportunity is immense. Per capita consumption of energy drinks is barely 5 ml, compared with, say, Canada, where it is seven cans a year,&rdquo; he adds. Given that margins can be as high as 70% (although 15% is the norm), investing in brand-building can be a profitable activity. But not everybody is spending big bucks on marketing.</p>\n<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><strong>A question of taste</strong></span></p>\n<p class="p2">Rahul Sangoi was near completing his MBA in Australia when a routine visit to the supermarket changed the course of his life. &ldquo;I was struck by the sheer number of options in the drinks segment &mdash; energy drinks, sports drinks, colas, vitamin water and flavoured water,&rdquo; he recalls. He wondered why India didn&rsquo;t have a similar spread on offer. Returning to India, Sangoi worked in the family business of distributing and retailing automotive products in Pune for a few years before deciding to act upon his insight. With brothers Rajiv and Rohan, he formed Silver Ice Beverages in <span class="s3">2007</span> and spent the next two years on product development. In <span class="s3">2009</span>, the brothers launched Rio, a carbonated beverage in three flavours &mdash; wild berry, blueberry peach and mango passion. &ldquo;We wanted to launch a fusion drink that was a concoction of tropical fruits. As it turned out, we were the first to enter the category,&rdquo; says Sangoi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">So far, the brothers have invested close to Rs 7.5 crore in the company, mostly sourced from family. Of this, Rs 6.5 crore went in setting up a manufacturing plant at Hadapsar, near Pune, which can churn out 1 million bottles and cans a month. It is currently working at 70% capacity utilisation, but Sangoi says the project has already broken even, without revealing current sales figures. A planned capacity expansion in FY15 will up total capacity by 60%. &ldquo;It is important to have one manufacturing facility. We will adopt the franchisee route once we start getting volumes from other states,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">Rio went against the prevailing trend for cans and launched its drink in glass bottles to establish a premium look-and-feel for the product. &ldquo;Our research indicated that status-conscious consumers preferred bottles,&rdquo; says Sangoi. Accordingly, the price was also set much higher than regular carbonated soft drinks (CSD) &mdash; Rs 25 for 250 ml, against Rs 12 for 200 ml of a cola or orange drink.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Rio is available at 13,000 outlets across six states (three more planned for this year): all kirana stores and canteens; the firm has consciously decided to stay away from modern trade, since its youthful customers don&rsquo;t really shop at these stores. In 2011, it launched the drink in cans (330 ml for Rs 30) and sales currently are evenly split between the two options.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Sangoi accepts that the company can&rsquo;t match the financial muscle of the big CSD players, which is why its marketing isn&rsquo;t about big-budget advertising. Instead, the company focuses on below-the-line promotions, putting up posters at stores and visiting college canteens for feedback. In fact, after students at a Pune college vetoed the proposed passion fruit flavour, the company went with the suggestion of one student &mdash; he had just returned from a holiday in the US and tried acai berry there. &ldquo;The lesson for us &mdash; know your audience and you will get the best feedback,&rdquo; says Sangoi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s also why Rio &mdash; named for the ultimate party destination, Rio de Janeiro &mdash; is going <em>desi</em>, having realised that while Indian consumers are willing to experiment, they are more open and accepting of traditional, familiar flavours. That&rsquo;s an insight shared by other drink manufacturers as well.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>India on the rocks</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Later this month, Rio will launch two flavours chosen to appeal to the Indian palate &mdash; <em>kala khatta</em> and guava. With this, the firm will also deepen its penetration in the six states where it is already available, reaching out to customers in the wider, 10-60 age group in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. My Rio, as the new drink is to be called, will be available in cans, making for easier transportation and logistics.</p>\n<p class="p3">Like Rio, the Gurgaon-based Hector Beverages, too, has launched a line catering to Indian tastes. Paper Boat was soft-launched early this year in 10 cities with flavours such as <em>jaljeera</em> and <em>aamras</em>, priced at Rs 25 for 250 ml. &ldquo;The idea was to revive Indian beverages. We were convinced about the ability to create a new category &mdash; an affordable, Indian option,&rdquo; says Suhas Misra, co-founder and director, Hector Beverages. Later this month, the firm will launch more flavours such as <em>kokum</em>, <em>kala khatta</em> and <em>aam panna</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But Paper Boat isn&rsquo;t Hector&rsquo;s original product. The company, launched by three former Coca-Cola India executives, made its foray into the functional drinks segment in late 2009 by launching Frissia, a protein drink powder. Available at health clubs and gyms, the product found itself pitted against established players in the health drinks market such as Godrej Sofit. It was soon phased out and in March 2011, Hector launched energy drink Tzinga.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Tzinga was meant to reach the value-conscious Indian consumer,&rdquo; explains Neeraj Kakkar, CEO, Hector Beverages. That meant it had to be competitively priced, so the company set up its own manufacturing plant, at Manesar, which can churn out 80 bottles a minute. Set up with an investment of Rs 12 crore, the plant currently operates at full capacity in the March-May peak season and at 60% the rest of the year. More than captive manufacturing, though, what has worked in Tzinga&rsquo;s favour is its use of doy packs &mdash; sealed plastic-and-foil bags that are designed to stand upright. Not only are they cheaper than cans, they also save space since they can lie flat as well. (Incidentally, Paper Boat drinks are also sold in doy packs.) &ldquo;If Tzinga was offered in a can, it would cost Rs 50 instead of Rs 25,&rdquo; says Misra.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;A higher price would be an obstacle in reaching out to Tzinga&rsquo;s target customer group: students. It&rsquo;s certainly popular among those burning the midnight oil: Hector claims its biggest account is IIT Bombay, where 35% of sales happen during exams. It is not just Mumbai: the company has been consciously reaching out to students pan-India, although about half its sales happen in south India. The brand is available across 40,000 outlets, including college canteens, BPOs, IT companies and &mdash; unlike many new players &mdash; modern trade. Also unlike other players, Tzinga advertises &mdash; starting March 2013, the brand took spots on channels such as EPL soccer, National Geographic, Discovery and MTV; the FY14 ad budget is #2.4 crore. It&rsquo;s also looking at regional channels such as Zonet, which is targeted at the northeast.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>On a high - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">How has Hector been able to afford advertising and modern trade margins &mdash; given their lack of bargaining power, smaller brands pay higher trade margins (around 25%) compared with the big beverage companies (15-20%, on average)? Two words: private equity. In 2011, the company attracted funding of Rs 6 crore from NR Narayana Murthy&rsquo;s Catamaran Venture Fund, Footprint Ventures and some angel investors. And in May 2013, Sequoia Capital invested Rs 27 crore, while another Rs 17 crore came from existing investors. &ldquo;We liked their approach to the beverages category, of introducing innovative segments such as Indian ethnic drinks. Tzinga, too, is an affordable energy drink and can grow in this nascent market,&rdquo; says VT Bharadwaj, managing director, Sequoia Capital. &ldquo;Historically, too, India has had a specialty juice culture, such as sugarcane juice and coconut water. Now, the big opportunity in India is that functional beverages can address a host of segments simultaneously, such as energy, sports, vitamins and flavoured water.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The big opportunity in India is that functional beverages can address a host of segments simultaneously" - VT Bharadwaj, managing director, Sequoia Capital</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">It is this potential that has brought Rs 1,500-crore Parle Agro back to the CSD market, two decades after its owner Prakash Chauhan, along with brother Ramesh, sold the Thums Up, Limca and Gold Spot brands to Coca-Cola. But not just any CSD &mdash; this time Parle Agro has launched a coffee-flavoured fizzy drink, Caf&eacute; Cuba. The trigger for the launch, says Nadia Chauhan Kurup, the company&rsquo;s joint managing director and chief marketing officer, is the limited flavour options currently available. &ldquo;Primarily, there is just cola, lemon and orange. This new category will lead to not just market share for Parle Agro but growth in the carbonated beverage market.&rdquo; Priced at Rs 20 for a 250-ml can and Rs 15 for a PET bottle, the drink is targeted at urban markets. It is already available in 10,000 outlets across the top cities, and by February 2014, will be available at 800,000 outlets nation-wide. While Parle Agro has the clout to carve a niche for itself, there are also several challenges facing new players in the FF soft drinks market.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>The aftertaste</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">With a slew of new brands in the market, albeit in different categories, standing out in the crowd won&rsquo;t be easy. In energy drinks especially, the market has been defined by Red Bull (<em>see: On a high</em>) and breaking its stranglehold, despite the premium price and positioning, will be a challenge, especially since traditional advertising&nbsp;is beyond the budget for many players. Then, the absence of these brands from modern trade outlets may cost them dearly.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"This new category will lead to not just market share for Parle Agro but growth in the carbonated beverage market" - Nadia Chauhan Kurup, joint managing director and CMO, Parle Agro</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">&ldquo;Brand building in FMCG is a big challenge since it depends greatly on distribution, which itself is a complex process,&rdquo; says Bisen of Technopak. Clearly, although functional beverages are tasty and serve a healthy purpose too, breaking habits and creating new ones in the beverages market is going to be an uphill task. But, like the others, Hector&rsquo;s Kakkar is up to the challenge. &ldquo;This is an early phase for the category, but the opportunity is just too big to ignore,&rdquo; he sums up.&nbsp;</p>', 'The fortified functional beverages market is seeing a distinct shift as new players are looking to create niche categories', '7', '', 0, '', 'unquenchable-thirst-414', 408, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Unquenchable thirst ', 'The fortified functional beverages market is seeing a distinct shift as new players are looking to create niche categories', '', '', '', 'Fortified soft drinks,Functional soft drinks', 0, NULL, '2015-02-05 13:03:17', '2015-02-05 13:32:07', '2013-10-26', 0),
(415, 12, '', 'Goodness Inside', '<p class="p1">By the time you finish reading this magazine, yet another farmer may have committed suicide in the dust bowl that is the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. Like most other people, your first instinct may be to turn away from this information. Or, like Apurva Kothari, you might sit up a little straighter, whip out pen and paper, and go about drafting a plan to lend a helping hand to the beleaguered farmers. That&rsquo;s what the tech professional did a couple of years ago, and the result was No Nasties, an organic, fair trade T-shirt brand.</p>\n<p class="p3">Kothari, a former product development manager with Travelocity, and his wife Shweta Deliwala, a designer with Polo Ralph Lauren, were living in suburban bliss in New York when news of farmer suicides in India exploded all over mainstream media in late 2005. By then the couple had been in the US for over a decade. With every visit back home, Kothari delved deeper into the issue, till he could no longer ignore the horrifying tally &mdash; according to National Crime Records Bureau data, nearly 285,000 Indian farmers have killed themselves since 1995, and suicide rates in the group are higher than for the rest of the population, the result of crippling loans and excessive dependence on the monsoons for irrigation. In 2010, Kothari and Deliwala decided they couldn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;sit and watch&rdquo; &mdash; they moved back to Mumbai and launched No Nasties in April 2011 with Rs 8 lakh of their own funds. Social incubation programme Unltd India has also invested close to Rs 3 lakh in the clothing venture.</p>\n<p class="p3">The idea of selling fair trade clothing had occurred to Deliwala in the past, when she explored the possibility of moving back to India to start her own fashion store. &ldquo;To us, fair trade clothing seemed like an ideal solution to India&rsquo;s labour and agricultural troubles &mdash; it was ethical, it would get farmers out of debt, and the production process and end product would be completely natural,&rdquo; says Kothari. A large proportion of the world&rsquo;s fair trade clothing originates from India and a majority of it is exported. Those who do sell in India are largely focused on ethnic wear. &ldquo;There are hardly any casual options for teenagers, so we decided to retail to this market,&rdquo; adds the 37-year-old.</p>\n<p class="p3">How does it work? Deliwala, who has set up her own independent venture, is the in-house consultant, deciding the styles, fits, fabrics and colours every season. Independent designers create the patterns for the tees, for which they get a 10% cut on every sale, a dedicated page on the No Nasties website and credit on the tag. The garments are manufactured in Kolkata, using organically grown, fair trade cotton sourced from a farmers&rsquo; cooperative working across Vidarbha, Telangana and Odisha. They are then printed in Tirupur using green, water-based dyes. The tees are sold through stores in Goa, Australia, Italy, Germany and Romania, and online across India and the world, where domestic delivery is made through Mirakle Couriers, which employs low-income hearing-impaired people. Oh, and the packaging is recycled too.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Buying green</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">But seriously, what&rsquo;s with the name? &ldquo;No Nasties is a fun name. We wanted something cool and catchy for the brand, nothing overtly &lsquo;green&rsquo; or preachy. We wanted to tell people that there is nothing &lsquo;nasty&rsquo; in the whole manufacturing process of our T-shirts: no GMO seeds, no toxic pesticides, no carcinogens in the dyes, inks and labels. It&rsquo;s our promise to the customers,&rdquo; says Kothari.</p>\n<p class="p3">As is usually the case, being good comes at a price. Most T-shirts in the No Nasties portfolio range from Rs 599 to Rs 1,199, making these garments more high street than roadside. Kothari defends the pricing. &ldquo;If you buy a T-shirt for #100-200, think about the margins the farmers producing cotton for that shirt must be getting. By buying cheap products, people unknowingly oppress some poor worker at the other end of the spectrum,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We want people to vote with their wallets. The social impact of a No Nasties T-shirt is baked right into the product.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Going green is just as costly for the promoter. Though No Nasties broke even within 10 months of its launch, Kothari still does not draw a salary, surviving on his savings and pumping all revenues back into the business. The brand&rsquo;s four-member team operates out of a flexioffice in Mumbai, saving on overheads. Still, they&rsquo;ve come a long way from when Kothari&rsquo;s home doubled as a warehouse for the 800 tees the brand started out with. Nearly two-and-a-half years and 10,000 T-shirts later, the garments are now stocked at the printer&rsquo;s facility in Tirupur, Tamil Nadu, and are dispatched directly from there after printing. The brand now stocks plain T-shirts and prints them on demand, to keep inventory levels low.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">More orders for No Nasties is good news for Chetna Organics, the firm that supplies fair trade organic cotton to No Nasties&rsquo; T-shirt manufacturer, Rajlakshmi Cotton Mills, in Kolkata. Chetna works with 40,000 farmers in the marginalised Vidarbha, Telangana and KBK (Koraput, Balangir and Kalahandi in Odisha) regions to ensure that the pest-prone cotton crop, among others, is protected from the slew of chemicals that make it vulnerable to failure and toxic for humans. &ldquo;We try to help farmers use organic methods to farm cotton and guide them in getting better value for their crops. The minimum monetary support provided by the government is hardly adequate, so our tie-ups with companies such as No Nasties ensure the farmers have a decent source of livelihood at all times,&rdquo; says Ayan Banerjee, CEO, Chetna Organic Agriculture Producer Co.</p>\n<p class="p3">Here&rsquo;s how a No Nasties T-shirt helps marginalised farmers. Every crop season, government agency Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) sets a minimum price for the purchase of different varieties of <em>kapaas</em> (unginned cotton). Organisations such as Chetna offer their farmers a hike on the CCI market price, plus a premium for adhering to organic standards, which they can invest in community initiatives such as roads, toilets and computer centres. Since the organic fair trade tag is more than just a business motto, Chetna is audited multiple times a year by a third-party firm, Fairtrade Foundation India (FFI), to ensure it adheres to the idea of producing sustainable, cruelty-free cotton. &ldquo;On an average, farmers associated with Chetna get 30-40% more for their cotton output than the market rate. That isn&rsquo;t the only benefit, though &mdash; they have much lower input costs, lower risk, lower debt and healthier soil due to crop biodiversity, which Chetna encourages,&rdquo; says Kothari, who researched several organic cotton suppliers around India before zeroing on Chetna.</p>\n<p class="p3">While sales have increased 100% since 2011 and Kothari is aiming for a 300% y-o-y growth in FY14, farmers are still struggling across India, thanks to a dip in demand due to the continued global slowdown and last year&rsquo;s monsoon woes. &ldquo;Thankfully, the farmers who have continued to work with us through Chetna are pretty happy because sales have tripled. In two years, the number of farmers working with us has gone up from 8,000 to nearly 15,000,&rdquo; says Kothari. Till now, No Nasties has bought about 2,500 kg of cotton from Chetna. This year, Kothari aims to sell around 20,000 T-shirts, translating into 5,000 kg of cotton.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Selling the social story</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">But it&rsquo;s not always easy. Working with a small team comes at a price: sometimes, orders get backed up for days. And being a small player in the retail segment, the brand doesn&rsquo;t get any priority from its sole factory in terms of deliveries. Sizing for different markets is also a tricky proposition. In spite of all those hiccups, the brand is building a fanbase among Mumbaikars, including celebrities &mdash; Aamir Khan and his film-maker wife Kiran Rao, celeb hairstylist Sapna Bhavnani, actor Jackie Shroff and musician Uday Benegal have all been seen sporting No Nasties tees. Benegal, lead vocalist of rock band Indus Creed, first came across the brand at the farmer&rsquo;s market in Bandra. He later tied up with Kothari to launch an Indus Creed collection. A batch of 300 T-shirts was created as a result of this collaboration and they are almost sold out by now.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The rub-off effect has encouraged Kothari to strike more B2B deals. No Nasties has supplied private label T-shirts to brands in the Czech Republic, the US, the UK, Indonesia and Japan. It also supplies T-shirts to educational NGO Atma and Reality Tours, which encourages socially responsible tourism. &ldquo;We and our customers are all fans of the shirts in terms of design and quality. I have a few No Nasties shirts myself and enjoy wearing them,&rdquo; says Adina Goerke, marketing director, Reality Tours.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With business booming, Kothari is moving into expansion mode. He&rsquo;s working on a second factory, in Tamil Nadu, and is looking into tie-ups with established e-commerce players to reach out to a wider audience. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for like-minded HNIs to partner with and have just started spreading the word. We need funds primarily to expand our product range, increase our team capacity and for advertising spend. Over the next 12 months, we are looking to pump in investments in the Rs 1-1.5 crore range,&rdquo; Kothari says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Apart from a future Bollywood collaboration, plans are also on to tie up with groups that have their own community backing, such as football teams or NGOs, so that the brand has access to a ready audience. Next on the agenda: clothing for babies and kids, laptop sleeves, totes, hoodies and summer dresses. &ldquo;I want to make No Nasties a sustainable venture, building a community to back it,&rdquo; says Kothari.&nbsp;</p>', 'Organic T-shirt brand No Nasties is helping Vidarbha''s farmers by making fair trade clothing fun', '12', '', 0, '', 'goodness-inside-415', 409, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Goodness Inside ', 'Organic T-shirt brand No Nasties is helping Vidarbha''s farmers by making fair trade clothing fun', '', '', '', 'No Nasties,Organic clothing,Fairtrade clothing,Chetana Organics', 0, NULL, '2015-02-05 13:33:27', '2015-02-05 14:53:13', '2013-10-26', 0),

With a great deal of patience and flexibility, says Andreas Hettich, MD and fourth-generation scion of Hettich Holding. The modular furniture industry in India is worth Rs 5,000 crore and coasting along at 15-20%. But in the past five years, the worst of the slowdown, the $1.2-billion company has been charging ahead at 29% CAGR in India. Hettich explains his eponymous company&rsquo;s strategy for growth in the country.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Take your time:</strong> We entered India in 2000 through a joint venture with Adventz of the Saroj Poddar group. While we were always certain about local manufacturing, we first had to build up the market and set up our network. So, plans for our first plant in India started only two or three years ago. It is now ready at Vadodara, Gujarat, at a cost of Rs 100 crore, with over 60,000 sq ft of constructed area. The first commercial dispatch has kicked off, and we expect about Rs 120-crore turnover from this plant over the next few years. Now, instead of setting up more plants in India, we will focus on expanding capacity at Vadodara.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Experience is key:</strong> Simply printing out the image of a hinge won&rsquo;t explain its usage. Nor will claiming we are backed by German technology impress consumers much. So, we have six application centres in India, where customers can touch and feel our products. Interacting with thousands of customers also gives us the actual experience and understanding of the market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Work around potential problems:</strong> Yes, India has a large, unorganised furniture market and yes, the actual facilitators are small furniture shops and independent carpenters, not big name brands. What we do is partner with these small, independent carpenters and train them in the use of our products. This helps in familiarising them with our product range. And this is not just a simple CSR activity; we spend on their training because their preference for our products is necessary for our survival. Also, most modular furniture companies in India currently use Hettich products for their setups, thereby promoting our range.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Maintain import-export balance:</strong> The wire baskets being produced at Vadodara sell well in India but aren&rsquo;t that popular in Germany. But other Asian markets show similar preferences. So, our new plant will make items not just for India but other Asian markets as well, even as we continue importing products such as hinges and door runners for India. At present, we are using only a third of the Vadodara capacity; we plan to expand that, set up production for more categories and start exporting in a year or two. <span class="s1"><br /></span></p>', 'Who wins when an MNC pits itself against a huge unorganised sector in the middle of a slowdown?', '12', '', 0, '', 'built-to-last-416', 410, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Built to last ', 'Who wins when an MNC pits itself against a huge unorganised sector in the middle of a slowdown ', '', '', '', 'Hettich Holding,Modular furniture', 0, NULL, '2015-02-05 14:55:24', '2015-02-05 15:00:23', '2013-10-26', 0);

(417, 16, '', 'Chasing the light', '<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s virtually unknown in the consumer lighting market. But NTL, the Rs 700-crore company Arun Gupta created with his brother Praveen, can safely claim to be at the heart of most fluorescent tubes and CFL lamps made in India, a position it holds as the largest maker of electronic drivers and ballasts that run modern lights. To the uninitiated, a ballast regulates the current in a fluorescent lighting system. With around 5,000 employees, NTL, which also contract manufactures CFLs for Indian lighting brands, now aims to strike out on its own in the emerging LED business.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">If this appears a tad too ambitious, Gupta&rsquo;s entrepreneurial journey offers some clues. A mechanical engineer from the 1982 batch at BIT Mesra, Ranchi, Gupta held jobs for eight years before starting out on his own, choosing to work in small companies to learn the ropes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a sales and marketing person from day one,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It helped me connect with other business processes in a company.&rdquo; Gupta&rsquo;s brush with electronics happened when he set out to market PCBs (printed circuit boards) in northern India on behalf of Indal, which had set up a high-end PCB manufacturing facility at Mysore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">In 1992, he launched Northern Telelinks to cater to the under-served demand for power filters required in C-DoT designed EPABX (exchanges) when India&rsquo;s telecom revolution was unfolding. A critical component in the power supply of an EPABX, these needed C-DoT approval as the exchanges had to work in difficult weather and operating conditions across India. It was an altogether new challenge, and Gupta says he could learn about systems and processes needed to produce to high reliability standards. His next round of learning came about when HCL-HP signed up NTL as a vendor for wiring harnesses, transferring some of its process orientation and knowledge to Gupta&rsquo;s team.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Around 1996, when cheaper imports from Taiwan and China threatened to put the electronics components industry out of business, Gupta found himself struggling to survive on PCBs alone, and explored new areas, before finally deciding to switch to making electronic transformers and ballasts for OEMs in CFLs and fluorescent lamps. &ldquo;It was a natural progression for us as a company,&rdquo; he says. The company was rebranded as NTL Electronics India with Osram as its first customer in 2002.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">From making 150,000 ballasts in the first year, NTL now makes 15-16 million of them in a month. &ldquo;Outside China, we are the largest manufacturer in the world,&rdquo; says Gupta. &ldquo;We are not only strong on design, but also on the components such as transistors, resistors and semiconductors that go into <span class="s1">it. We have very stringent specifications &mdash; we don&rsquo;t go by what is available. This is where we have created a difference.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>The burning point</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">Gupta likes to call NTL &ldquo;a challenger company&rdquo;, a phrase that keeps cropping up in our conversations with him. One of the company&rsquo;s decisions that gave it a distinct edge was to enter manufacturing even though at the time, the option of sourcing components and assembling was a more attractive one. &ldquo;Others shied away from manufacturing because it had too many issues. We said we&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; he says. The turning point came in 2009 when NTL was contracted to make the first batch of LED lamps in the country for the Netherlands-based Lemnis Lighting, which three years earlier had introduced the world&rsquo;s first LED light bulb as a replacement for incandescent lamps, under the Pharox brand.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Lighting effect - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">Lemnis was among the start-ups incubated at Tendris Holding BV, a Dutch sustainable technology solutions company. It had the technology but not the manufacturing capabilities. To produce and distribute its LED light bulbs in India, Lemnis signed an MoU with Crompton Greaves and, as its existing vendor, NTL ended up making the first LED lamp that could work in Indian conditions. Gupta recalls how the Pharox samples made to European standards, failed in Noida&rsquo;s notoriously bad power conditions. &ldquo;Within a minute and a half all five burned out,&rdquo; he says. It was clear that the power supply circuitry &mdash; known as the driver &mdash; had to be redone if the lamps were to work, let alone last, in India. Gupta&rsquo;s team redesigned and then produced a version of the LED driver that Crompton Greaves could sell. But priced at #1,200-odd a piece, the LED lamps were an idea ahead of its time, at least in India.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">Two years later in 2011, when Lemnis bagged an order from IKEA for its European stores, it directly got in touch with NTL. But there was a hitch. IKEA wasn&rsquo;t convinced of the capabilities of this unknown ballast and CFL maker. &ldquo;IKEA has one of the most difficult compliance systems in the world,&rdquo; says Gupta. Its India sourcing arm checked and found the company was indeed a heavyweight when it came to ballasts and drivers. In June 2011, NTL bagged the order for making 4.3 million LED lamps for IKEA&rsquo;s in-store brand. &ldquo;It was the largest such order in the world at the time,&rdquo; says Gupta. Perhaps it was that stamp of confidence that prompted Lemnis to suggest a deeper partnership. Last April, the two companies entered into a 50:50 joint venture, NTL Lemnis, to design, produce and sell LED lighting systems for India and the global market as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">The bigger question now is: can NTL Lemnis create a successful business in the LED space? Gupta, who is also the global chief executive officer for NTL Lemnis, believes so. In India, the impetus for LED growth has largely come about because of increasing government support. &ldquo;When the CFL light was introduced in the Indian market, Chinese products were selling at Rs 15, whereas the price back then was Rs 150. Eventually, the government brought in standards for CFL lights and today India is the No.2 CFL-producing country after China. That happened because of the awareness about CFL lights and I see this repeating with LED lights as well,&rdquo; says Gupta. That&rsquo;s happened.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>&lsquo;LED&rsquo; by a promise</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">In 2009, the rapidly-growing influx of inexpensive China-manufactured LED products saw the National Manufacturing Competitive Council convening a core committee to look into the adoption of LED lighting in the country. The panel submitted a report in 2010 where it made a case for LEDs to reduce electricity demand for lighting, which consumes 22-25% of the national load. The report singled out residential electricity demand as a significant potential market for LED lamps. There are 400 million lamps in Indian households, mostly incandescent bulbs, consuming 70 million MWh annually and the penetration of LEDs in this sector is expected to reduce household electricity by 30%. Even as policy makers are realising the benefits of LED, the rush has already begun with traditional lighting players, consumer electronics companies and emerging players jostling for a share of the business. Gupta says the stiffest challenge the LED industry faces today is to have reliable electronics inside the LED product, where NTL scores better due to its experience. &ldquo;We are extremely strong in component engineering,&rdquo; he says. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">&ldquo;The IP in LED is the chip and the power electronics,&rdquo; says Deepa Doraiswamy, industry manager, electronics and security, Frost &amp; Sullivan India. &ldquo;The electronic circuit is the control mechanism. It determines longevity, durability and performance of the LED lamp.&rdquo; Frost &amp; Sullivan estimates the Indian LED lighting market at $143 million, less than 4% of the overall lighting market. The business is expected to grow at a CAGR of 47.3% between 2011 and 2018, to touch $1.3 billion by 2018, or 15-20% of overall lighting <em>(see: Shining through)</em>. &ldquo;The proportion of the organised LED market will change by 2018. Its share will go up to 75%, because by then LED standards will be set.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>Shining through - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">Currently, the LED market comprises bulbs, displays, signals, key pad lighting, camera flashlights, decorative lighting, street lighting and so on. &ldquo;Five years from now, the lighting market in India will be completely dominated by LED lights. LED lights currently cost four to five times that of CFL, but when this multiple reduces to one or two, LED will win over CFL,&rdquo; says Sunil Sikka, president, Havells India. NTL is also counting on this to increase NTL-Lemnis&rsquo; share to 5% of the Indian LED business in the next five years, by when things could change significantly.</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>"LED lights currently cost four to five times that of CFL, but when this multiple reduces to one or two, LED will win over CFL" - Sunil Sikka, president, Havells India</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">In fact, LED lighting is already growing at four times the 10-12% rate of the overall lighting market. Currently, Philips has the largest market share at 17%, followed by Osram. &ldquo;If we take 2012 as base year, Philips is the largest player, with a 17% market share. Some of the other companies such as MIC Electronics, Instapower, Promptec, form the tier two part, with 10-15% market share,&rdquo; says Doraiswamy. But bagging government projects changed companies&rsquo; ranking every year. Driven by this trend, the top 10 companies in recent years include MIC Electronics, Goldwyn LED, Sanarti Group, Bajaj Electricals, Gautam Polymers etc. &ldquo;In India, the public sector, street lighting, commercial and industrial segments, contribute to 95% of the overall LED segment. Commercial will take off in a big manner, considering the number of hotels coming up and the fact that they are converting to more energy-efficient lighting technology,&rdquo; she adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">NTL&rsquo;s experiences in the OEM space could be of some use here, and so will its networks. But bagging large orders, especially in the large government lighting segment, where energy service companies play a crucial role, could be a challenge. Further, while the company plans a retail foray to address the consumer market, nothing&rsquo;s finalised yet. NTL&rsquo;s test will be in creating a robust distribution network, building sales force competencies and brand recall even as more familiar names in lighting are also ramping up their LED businesses. &ldquo;You need to have appropriate channel partnerships with architects, lighting contractors, electrical consultants and so on, and this takes a couple of years,&rdquo; says Doraiswamy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Street play</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">NTL Lemnis currently reaches out to institutional buyers through its presence in the North and South. It has around 128 products aimed at segments such as retail, offices, commercial, outdoor and hospitality, with plans to double this portfolio in the current year. Given the energy-intensive nature of the business, savings accrue much earlier in large installations in the institutional segment than in the consumer space. Priced at Rs 600 to Rs 1,000 compared with a CFL that comes for Rs 80 to Rs 250, the ROI on an LED lamp&rsquo;s usage in the institutional segment is two to 2.5 years while for a consumer it could be as much as five to six years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">For now, new application segments such as industrial lighting, healthcare and outdoor are on NTL&rsquo;s radar. However, retrofitting of high-pressure sodium vapour lamps used in street lights, is the big opportunity. &ldquo;The lowest hanging fruit is street lighting; it constitutes over 65% of overall revenues in LED in India,&rdquo; points out Doraiswamy. &ldquo;There are roughly 100 million streetlights in India, which consume energy for 10-14 hours every day. This is where efficient LED lighting will make a difference.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>"Street lighting is the big business, constituting over 65% of the overall LED market" - Deepa Doraiswamy, industry manager, electronics and security, Frost &amp; Sullivan India</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">Incidentally, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) is providing grants to municipalities to undertake pilot trials of LED street lamps, since public lighting in the country requires around 4,400 MW of connected load. Trials have been carried out in cities in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Maharashtra and Nagaland. Given that there are 3,723 urban local bodies in India that have inadequate street lighting and spend huge sums on their operation and maintenance, the potential savings in energy by switching to LED is enormous.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>The future is bright</strong></p>\n<p class="p5">NTL&rsquo;s recognised capability in making electronic drivers may not be enough to give it a competitive edge as many players are getting into that. &ldquo;It is easy because making of drivers is not a guarded technology and doesn&rsquo;t cost much in terms of initial investment,&rdquo; says Sikka. While most lighting companies source ballasts and drivers from electronic manufacturing services companies such as NTL, Havells also has a captive unit in Noida, which employs over 1,000 people. However, Sikka concedes that NTL&rsquo;s focus on this segment makes it a leading player. &ldquo;They do it more efficiently.&rdquo; The real value in LED, though, is through fixtures or luminaires, which house the LEDs.&nbsp; While Gupta plans to get into these later, Havells has invested over Rs 100 crore in its new fixtures plant in Neemrana, Rajasthan, the first in the country.</p>\n<p class="p6">In August 2010, PE firm CX Advisors invested Rs 90 crore for a 20% stake in NTL, when it was only manufacturing electronic ballasts at its Noida facility. &ldquo;NTL has gone up the value chain since then,&rdquo; says Ajay Relan, managing partner at CX Advisors. &ldquo;It has evolved from a component manufacturer to a CFL producer to a branded LED maker. NTL has strong manufacturing expertise, which India lacks, especially when it comes to [lighting] electronics. It is the largest manufacturer and better in quality than most players.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>"NTL has strong manufacturing expertise, which India lacks, especially when it comes to [lighting] electronics" - Ajay Relan, managing partnere, CX Advisors</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">With over 450 companies estimated to be operating in the overall space in India, NTL could have an edge. A large chunk of LED companies are importers and traders, who bring no value addition to the product or the technology. What worked for NTL in its core business was a focus on in-house research, and developing its own electronics circuitry rather than buying off-the-shelf as many players do. It could be its trump card going forward, too. &ldquo;Drivers is a specialised market; everybody who&rsquo;s into LEDs needs drivers,&rdquo; says Gupta.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">Reliability promises to be one of the main planks on which serious players in LED lighting could build their brands, just like in CFLs. &ldquo;Everybody is bringing products from China but they don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going into the product. It takes at least a year to realise that,&rdquo; Gupta says. In large-scale installations, servicing of LED lamps and fixtures is crucial to the value proposition, given the high investments involved. &ldquo;You need serviceability. Replacement isn&rsquo;t a solution.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p6">NTL&rsquo;s technology research focus is evident from the 50 people-strong R&amp;D team at its Noida headquarters. &ldquo;They come from mechanical, thermal and optics backgrounds,&rdquo; says Gupta. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re planning to add another 60-70 people over the next one year.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a very limited talent pool and companies often pay four to five times the going rate to lure away technical professionals, he adds. &ldquo;The talent pool in the power supply industry is limited worldwide. It is very core engineering; you also need good understanding of magnetics.&rdquo; Retaining this kind of talent hasn&rsquo;t been easy, he admits. &ldquo;We focus a lot on organisation building,&rdquo; points out Gupta.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">NTL Lemnis might have some time to get its act together in this emerging business that promises fierce competition soon, though much of the action will continue to be in street lighting. Over the next five years, the company expects revenue contribution from this segment to double from the current 13% or #90 crore. &ldquo;Revenue contribution from LED will grow faster than non-LED business as the LED industry is growing at 40-50% every year,&rdquo; says Gupta. &ldquo;We should be doubling our [overall] revenues to about Rs 1,500 crore in the next five years,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">For a company that has grown at about 50% CAGR over the past five years, Gupta is now betting on LED to add that glow in his business. Having ploughed in #70 crore thus far into the joint venture, he knows there&rsquo;s no margin for error, but he&rsquo;s unflinching. He says confidently, &ldquo;We believe LED is a business we can easily do here.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>', 'Ballast-maker NTL Electronics has ambitions in the LED lighting space.

The Rs 5,600-crore payment crisis that has since gripped the exchange has had a cascading effect on the fortunes of the listed promoter entity, FTIL, and also of MCX, the other listed commodity exchange. The stock prices have crashed by 85% and 72%, respectively, since January 1, 2013 to Rs 167 and Rs 406. Shah owns 45% and 26%, respectively, in both the entities.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Crash course - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Incidentally, MCX also holds minority stake in a few exchanges, promoted by FTIL, such as MCX-SX (5% equity interest, 33% economic interest through warrants) and 5% equity stake in Dubai Gold and Commodities Exchange. While MCX-SX is the number two currency derivatives exchange in India, after NSE, its equity exchange operations is a distant third, after NSE and BSE.</p>\n<p class="p3">The irony escapes no one, considering both the stocks were counted among the Street&rsquo;s favourites. In fact, just before the crisis broke out, Kotak Institutional Equities had, in May, initiated coverage on the MCX stock with a fair value of Rs 990 a share, citing the exchange&rsquo;s growing heft in the commodities business. Similarly, early this year, Karvy Stock Broking had put out a target of Rs 1,446 for FTIL for its comprehensive role in the financial markets. Madhumita Ghosh, senior vice-president, research, Unicon Securities, says, &ldquo;The damage is of a varied kind. The brand name has already gone for a toss for MCX and I don&rsquo;t see any positive development in the stock, in the near future.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There is also the risk of FTIL losing control over both the exchanges in the event the Forward Markets Commission deems it fit to remove the management and Sebi takes similar action with respect to MCX-SX, which falls under its regulatory purview.

(420, 20, '', 'Booster shot', '<p class="p1">It is unusual to hear the finance team in hospitals talk about medical outcomes. For doctors, medical outcome is the Holy Grail, while keeping a tight leash on costs is what finance guys do. But Suneeta Reddy, who spearheads the finance function as joint managing director of Apollo Hospitals, keeps telling her teams to focus on medical outcomes rather than worry about costs. &ldquo;The Apollo model is built on clinical excellence. Without that, we would not have the pricing power or the volumes that have been essential drivers of our growth.&rdquo; she says, sitting in her swanky office overlooking a terrace garden on the 12<sup>th</sup> floor of the new corporate office in Chennai. &ldquo;There is a demand-supply gap but there are a number of hospitals coming up. The choice is with the customer and we want to ensure the decision tilts towards us by focusing on medical outcomes.&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With over 8,000 footfalls a day across its 51 hospitals, Apollo Hospitals is certainly the preferred choice of many patients. It has a capacity of 8,420 beds spread across 38-owned hospitals (6,382 beds) and 13 managed hospitals (2,038 beds), making it one of Asia&rsquo;s leading healthcare providers. It also owns a network of primary clinics, a health insurance company and a retail pharmacy business &mdash; one of the largest in India, with a network of close to 1,500 outlets &mdash; thereby having a presence at almost every point of the medical value chain. &ldquo;Somewhere along the line all the businesses fit nicely, helping us capture the mind share of the consumer and making it easier for them to access the system,&rdquo; points out Reddy. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Ill-equipped - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Started as a 150-bed hospital in Chennai in 1983 by Prathap C Reddy, a cardiologist who returned to India after a long stint in the US, Apollo has come a long way, riding on the huge unmet demand in the healthcare space. Healthcare infrastructure falls woefully short in India. For instance, the number of beds per 10,000 people in India is just nine, compared with 42 in China and 33 in the UK <em>(see: Ill-equipped)</em>. In a market where out-of-pocket spending on healthcare is significantly higher than state spending and with the government system in no position to cater to the healthcare demands of the populace, private players such as Apollo Hospitals have benefited largely from the growing demand for healthcare, particularly from the middle class. Between FY08 and FY13, revenue has grown at an average 25% with earnings growth coming in stronger at 29%.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Bed and butter - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Given that healthcare needs in India are still largely under-served, it is unlikely this growth will prove to be a flash in the pan. But Apollo is leaving nothing to chance. To sustain its growth rate, the company has planned over 2,685 beds in the next three years; around 1,000 will be added in the current fiscal. Of the 1,000, 30% are in Chennai, 50% in its Reach Hospitals and the rest in Bengaluru <em>(see: Bed and butter)</em>. According to Perin Ali, analyst at Edelweiss Securities, these additions will contribute around 30% to growth over FY13-15.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Eager to grow</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">While the main cluster at Hyderabad, with 930 beds, will see no addition, it has big plans for Chennai. The original hospital in Chennai, with operational bed capacity of 1,267, is one of the company&rsquo;s largest and busiest; Apollo is now working on decongesting this facility by setting up separate outpatient care and adding a multispecialty hospital. The two cities together contribute around two-thirds of standalone healthcare revenue. Now, Apollo is looking to develop Bengaluru as its third major cluster in South India. It has just commissioned a new hospital in the city&rsquo;s Jayanagar area and looking to double bed count by commissioning another hospital in the city later this year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">And even as Apollo looks to be the dominant healthcare provider in big cities, reaching a wide urban population, it is also looking to cater to the healthcare needs in tier 2 and tier 3 towns through its chain of Reach hospitals. Since 2008, Reach hospitals have been set up at Karimnagar in Andhra Pradesh and Karur and Karaikudi in Tamil Nadu; in Q4FY13, a fourth centre was opened at Ayanambakkam, a Chennai suburb. &ldquo;As real estate costs are much lower, these hospitals turn break even at the operational level within 18 months, compared with a super-speciality where it takes a minimum 24 months to break even,&rdquo; says Reddy. Little wonder, then, that Apollo is looking to expand the Reach network: three new hospitals are coming up in Nellore, Trichy and Nashik and the management expects a third of its revenues to come from these hospitals in the next three to five years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While bed additions are important to sustain growth in the hospital business, in capital-intensive ventures it is more important to improve the efficiency of existing assets. Asset utilisation in a hospital can be increased by reducing the average length of stay (ALOS) of patients, and over the past five years, Apollo has brought its ALOS down from 5.18 days to 4.65 days <em>(see: Stay less, pay more)</em>. Now, with the introduction of robotic surgery across specialisations, which is expensive but where the recovery time is three times faster, the company feels there will be no need for bed additions in the metros after its planned expansion till 2016. Currently, its 6,382 owned beds have an occupancy rate of 72% <br /> (as on FY13).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Stay less, pay more - graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Increasing revenues from beds also plays a critical part in improving the overall profitability of the business. This is a function of the case mix, growth in inpatient volumes and the pricing power of the hospital, all three of which work in Apollo&rsquo;s favour. Over the past five years, average revenue per bed (ARPOB) has increased by 8.6% and the company expects the growth in ARPOB to remain in the same region in the next couple of years as well.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Goodwill at par</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The proposed capex will cost Apollo Rs 2,200 crore, which will be funded through equity infusion and debt. So far, the company has already invested over Rs 600 crore. While some media reports said the company is looking to raise around $400 million by selling 51% to 75% stake in a business trust that would hold its property assets and list in Singapore, the management has indicated it may not go in for listing in the near term, given the current tax implications. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t need to go in for a business trust to fund their current plans,&rdquo; adds Prashant Nair, deputy head of research, Citi India. &ldquo;One of the things we like about Apollo is its strong balance sheet. The debt-equity ratio is low and its ability to fund most of its expansion plans through own cash generation has improved.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">At the same time, Apollo founder Prathap Reddy himself has confirmed that PCR Investments (a privately-held firm by the promoters) is in talks with private equity bulge firm KKR, looking to sell 7% stake in the investment arm (which would translate into 3-4% stake in Apollo Hospitals). The investment would come on the heels of the exit of Apax Partners, which invested Rs 427 crore for 11.4% stake in 2007 only to sell its stake completely this year. Shashank Singh, MD, Apax Partners India, who worked closely with Apollo on, among other things, bringing the pharmacy business to profitability, is definitely not complaining. His firm is said to have made a 3X return on its investment in Apollo. &ldquo;We liked the management and the fact that they were able to attract and retain the best talent, which really helped them in execution,&rdquo; says Singh. &ldquo;Despite being a tightly-run family business, they were always willing to listen and make changes to the business that would enhance return for all the stakeholders.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We liked the Apollo management and the fact that they were able to attract and retain the best talent" - Shashank Singh, managing director, Apax Partners India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">With happy investors on its side and a net debt/equity ratio under 0.5 times, the company is confident of raising funds as and when required. &ldquo;The management has been very focused on return on capital and has been careful in selecting their projects. Both factors are very important in capital-intensive businesses such as hospitals,&rdquo; says Citi India&rsquo;s Nair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But Apollo is looking to take advantage of the change in FDI regulations in retail and divest a portion of its pharmacy business as operations turn profitable. &ldquo;We are talking to several people and are looking at divesting some stake in our retail pharmacy business at a certain time. But right now we are improving our profitability and gaining critical mass. The cash from the stake sale will help us reduce our overall debt levels and help us grow faster,&rdquo; says Reddy. In the next three years, the company plans to add 500 pharmacies, taking the total to 2,000. Currently, the pharmacy business contributes approximately 29% to overall revenues. Apollo also makes around 50-60% gross margin on private labels compared with 22% on branded medicines and it hopes to increase the share of private label sales from 5% to 20% in the next three years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"There are some who wonder why Apollo is charging a premium, but in the end it is about quality" - Suneeta Reddy, joint managing director, Apollo Hospitals&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">While there remains a huge unmet need in healthcare, competition in the space is increasing with affordable models emerging as mainstream options. &ldquo;Healthcare is becoming a price-sensitive market and there are some who wonder why Apollo is charging a premium, but in the end it is about quality.

The management believes that expansion plans will help sustain revenue growth rates at 20% over the next two to three years. &ldquo;Despite a larger revenue base, it is what we have set up ourselves to achieve and there is a definitely a market that will allow us to do that,&rdquo; says Reddy. Analysts, too, think Apollo should meet its target with consensus estimates for revenue and earnings growth at 23% and 25%, respectively, for the next two years riding on the back of increasing insurance penetration and medical tourism. The stock, which has nearly doubled over the past three years, from Rs 461 to Rs 915 currently, trades at 14 times estimated FY15 EV/Ebitda compared with Fortis, which trades at 22 times estimated FY15 EV/Ebitda. Analysts believe that since the hospital business in India is still in an investment phase, EV/Ebitda is a better valuation parameter compared with earnings multiple. But, given the growth prospects in the healthcare industry, expansion plans, strong balance sheet and peer valuation, Apollo Hospitals still looks the most attractive bet in the listed healthcare space.&nbsp;</p>', 'Expansion into smaller towns and a booming healthcare industry are helping Apollo Hospitals find favour with investors ', '6', '', 0, '', 'booster-shot-420', 414, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Booster shot ', 'Expansion into smaller towns and a booming healthcare industry are helping Apollo Hospitals find favour with investors ', '', '', '', 'Apollo Hospitals,Healthcare,Reach Hospitals', 0, NULL, '2015-02-05 16:56:00', '2015-02-05 17:14:49', '2013-10-26', 0),

(422, 24, '', 'Singing away the blues', '<p class="p1">Life is a perfect blend of technology and music for Sunil Gupta, 41, president and chief operating officer of Netmagic Solutions. At work, he is popular for organising karaoke sessions at various office events and parties, and at his 50-member karaoke group at the Forest Club in suburban Mumbai, Gupta is best known for his tech know-how and is informally called the technical director of the group.</p>\n<p class="p3">Gupta, who joined Netmagic in 2010 after completing a decade at Reliance Communications, traces his karaoke obsession to three years ago. &ldquo;Some neighbours and club members got together and decided to start regular karaoke sessions. They got hold of an old TV and a karaoke mic, and the group took off,&rdquo; he says, adding that he was not an active member of the club till then. &ldquo;I was very curious when I read about the sessions in our local newspaper. I had never sung in public before joining the club. Having inherited musical skills from my mother, though, I decided to give singing a shot.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">An alumnus of NIT Kurukshetra, Gupta grew up in Punjab and Haryana. &ldquo;I could at best be called a bathroom singer before I joined the group,&rdquo; he laughs. Over the years, he has honed that skill, experimenting with Jagjit Singh&rsquo;s <em>ghazals</em> before graduating to Kishore Kumar&rsquo;s popular ditties. His karaoke group meets once a month at the club, with members taking turns on a first-come-first-serve basis. Gupta&rsquo;s professional ease with technology has translated into smoother, error-free sessions for the group. From being completely unfamiliar to the workings of karaoke machinery three years ago, he can now expertly navigate the settings and has helped procure a better sound system for the sessions. &ldquo;From being completely uninvolved in the club&rsquo;s workings three years ago, I&rsquo;m now the first one to show up for these events,&rdquo; he laughs.</p>\n<p class="p3">His favourite pastime has slowly seeped into his daily routine as well. Two years ago, Gupta got a karaoke set installed at home, and he now practises on it every alternate day for 15-20 minutes. &ldquo;As more club members signed up for our karaoke group, we realised that we get hardly more than one chance to sing in the four hours we spend at the club each month,&rdquo; Gupta explains. So, the first few members who actually set up the group (including Hiranandani group&rsquo;s director of engineering Cyrus Pithawalla, Mastek MD Ashank Desai, Coating &amp; Coating owner Darshak Bhayani and founder president of CliffDew Management Consultants, Adarsh Sakhuja) formed another group of their own. &ldquo;We meet every fourth Sunday at any member&rsquo;s home.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With karaoke making an appearance even at home functions (Gupta organised a session for his parents&rsquo; 50<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary celebration earlier this year), it is clear that this hobby has become a part of his life. &ldquo;These karaoke sessions have helped me mingle with neighbours and club members as well. I&rsquo;ve been living in the same locality for the past 13 years, and yet it is only in the last three years that I have really got a chance to interact and chat with my neighbours,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Even at his work place, where Gupta is otherwise known to be a workaholic, his regular karaoke stints are making him popular as a singer. Says Gupta, &ldquo;Music has brought a semblance of balance to my life. I spend most of my 45-minute commute home from work lost in music.

The domain of environmental governance has been the forte of a motley group of environmentalists and later, environmental economists. In the absence of a holistic and trans-disciplinary approach to understanding environmental governance, action has been too late (the State of the Environment Report was brought out by the environment ministry only in 2009 and the Economic Survey started adding a chapter on Sustainable Development only from 2012) or too little (recurring conflicts on competing usage of land, forests and river water).</p>\n<p class="p3">Against this backdrop, the essays compiled in the book <em>Environmental Governance &mdash; Approaches, Imperatives and Methods</em> provides a fresh perspective to the multitude of vexed issues of not just protecting the environment but managing the sustainable extraction of environmental benefits for private welfare. The freshness of perspectives arrives from the diversity in the backgrounds of the authors &mdash; economists, policy makers, historians <em>et al</em>. The collection of essays, mostly based on papers presented at the Conference of the Indian Society of Ecological Economics, 2009, have been edited by three experts at the forefront of research in the field of ecological economics.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The freshness is evident in the attempt to show how questions on sustainability can hopefully be met through inter-disciplinary, policy-oriented research and participative human institutions. The editors say that bottom-up perspectives on environmental governance demand that &lsquo;public interest science&rsquo; play a crucial role in supporting environmental movements. Noted economist Kirit Parikh focuses on the role of natural resource accounting in guiding national developmental policies, while well-known educationist YK Alagh highlights the issues of land and water management in achieving sustainable agriculture.</p>\n<p class="p3">Further enriching this collection is the section devoted to case studies drawn from different parts of South Asia.

(426, 12, '', 'The learning curve', '<p class="p1">Touted as Bollywood diva Sridevi&rsquo;s comeback vehicle, <em>English Vinglish</em> was one of the most-anticipated movies of 2012. But when audiences walked out of theatres (or turned off their screens) after watching the film, it was to talk not about the star, but her role: of Shashi Godbole, the Maharashtrian housewife from <em>English Vinglish</em> who smiles through her family&rsquo;s taunts at her sub-par English language skills. Humiliated for her inability to speak English, Shashi joins a four-week course at a language school, and the movie ends on a happy note with Shashi making a heartfelt climactic speech in fluent English. The movie is inspired by countless true stories of people struggling in their personal and professional lives due to their inability to interact in English. Vivek Agarwal, CEO of English language product and training company Liqvid eLearning, says almost everyone aspires to converse in perfect English. &ldquo;In a scene straight out of the movie, a housewife once told me she wished to learn English because her son was too embarrassed to introduce her to his friends,&rdquo; says the 42-year-old IIM-C grad. In a country where an elementary understanding of the language can increase social mobility, serve as common ground and open up job prospects, failure to grasp English can prove to be a handicap. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>English Edge - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Liqvid (derived from &lsquo;liquidus&rsquo;, the Latin word for fluid, and &lsquo;vid&rsquo;, the Sanskrit word for &lsquo;to know&rsquo;) is trying to address this need. Agarwal and his friend Manish Kumar pooled in Rs 4 crore from personal savings and loans from friends and family to start Liqvid in 2002. &ldquo;People want to learn English primarily for three reasons: to secure a better job, to pass an exam or study in an English-medium institute and to be able to interact better with their social circle,&rdquo; Agarwal says. He reels off statistics in favour of English. &ldquo;There was an article three months ago in <em>Harvard Business Review</em> that said around 25% of the world&rsquo;s population converses in English. It has become the language of business and opportunity. For English Edge, the market is not just India, but several other non-English speaking countries,&rdquo; says Agarwal.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>ABCs of start-up</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Predictably, this makes teaching English a business proposition as well, and Liqvid has capitalised on this. The company is the new-age equivalent of the brick-and-mortar spoken English institutes, using its own customised software, English Edge, to provide English language learning solutions. Posters for the software, which is compatible with PCs, laptops, tablets and smartphones, dominate the walls of the Noida-based company&rsquo;s office, highlighting common mistakes such as: &lsquo;She lives in my backside&rsquo;, &lsquo;Please open the fan&rsquo; and &lsquo;Small-small children are playing&rsquo;. Having worked with GE Capital in the past and founded e-learning company eGurucool.com, Agarwal was certainly not short of experience or skills when he launched his own start-up. Liqvid began by providing e-learning solutions globally before launching its proprietary software in 2007-08.</p>\n<p class="p3">English Edge uses multimedia and interactive features such as a record-compare tool for correct pronunciation and visual cues for intonation, so that classes are not monotonous. The software is custom-designed for schools, colleges, vocational institutes and corporate and government offices. The teaching methodology also differs for kids and adults. For the latter, the software is equipped to teach English in nine regional languages. &ldquo;Grown-ups find it difficult to grasp the language, so we teach them basic social interaction in their own languages. The school curriculum is more academic, where we teach students the basics of grammar,&rdquo; says Agarwal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The program was first launched at the British Council, which then became Liqvid&rsquo;s first customer. The company tied up with the BBC in 2005 for content, and the latter trained Liqvid&rsquo;s team of language and technology experts in designing the curriculum. Since then, Liqvid designs its own entry-level courseware, using the BBC&rsquo;s coursebook for advanced courses and giving it a royalty on every sale of the software. Its portability has made English Edge extremely popular in schools. Here, Liqvid offers a &lsquo;portable language lab&rsquo;, which is a compact trolley that houses up to 40 tablets with English Edge preloaded on them, a Wi-Fi router and a projector. &ldquo;The teacher uses a master tab connected to all the other tabs, enabling real-time two-way interactions in class,&rdquo; says Agarwal. In semi-urban areas, Liqvid supplies course books instead, with the software pre-installed on a desktop.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With more than 200 institutes in 500 locations using the software, Liqvid has been able to reach out to nearly 250,000 students. It has several big clients such as the DPS chain, IIT Delhi and Jamia Milia Islamia. The software&rsquo;s content is aligned to the National Curriculum Framework for Classes I-X. The teaching methodology during the suggested weekly one-hour sessions remains the same for all classes, with only the difficulty level increasing each year. Gyanandni Rawal, 22, who takes English Edge lessons as part of her MSc curriculum at Allahabad University, says, &ldquo;The course has many stages of learning and difficulty that we have to move through. Many of the students who come here are from vernacular backgrounds, so it is very helpful for them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">GK Rai, director of the Institute of Professional Studies at Allahabad University, agrees. &ldquo;Most of our students come from the Hindi heartland and they are not conversant in English. We came across English Edge two years ago and have been using it ever since.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Learning and growing</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Liqvid&rsquo;s 150-strong sales team markets its products directly to schools, colleges and vocational training institutes. The company is now looking to tap into rural markets as well. &ldquo;We have signed up with the Orissa government to provide our software in 13 remote tribal areas, benefitting 6,000-7,000 people,&rdquo; says Agarwal. For such tie-ups, the state pays Liqvid a licence fee and the cost of the software. Usually, the firm charges a per learner fee or licenses its software to the client for a year. &ldquo;We charge between Rs 500-5,000 per learner per programme for a single course of 60-100 hours. Where there are more than a 1,000 learners in one place, we license the software for close to Rs 2-3 lakh a year,&rdquo; he says. The company is happy with its revenue stream and is not interested in setting up coaching centres.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Multiple levels of encryption protect the software, and it can&rsquo;t run on a device unless it is licensed by the firm. Individual elements have also been encrypted, in addition to authentication via central servers. The company is funded by Bedrock Venture Management, which invested $1 million in 2010, and by Japanese venture capital firm SBI Holdings, which put in $3 million last year. Vivek Bihani, director, Bedrock, says, &ldquo;Liqvid is completely focused on spoken English, while every other company looks at curriculum development. The spoken English market is unorganised and very fragmented. There was a clear space for a brand to come in.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The spoken English market is fragmented. There was space for a brand to come in" - Vivek Bihani, director, Bedrock</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Liqvid is expected to clock about Rs 25 crore in revenues by March 2014, with 25% operating margin. The firm has been growing at a 30-40% CAGR since 2005. While revenues are split 50-50 between English Edge and its e-learning solutions for corporates, Agarwal expects this ratio to soon change to 80:20. Once it has a pan-India presence, he plans to take English Edge to other non-English speaking countries in Latin America, Africa and West Asia.</p>\n<p class="p3">The other big expansion Liqvid is looking at is entering the B2C segment. &ldquo;We want to make our software available to everyone through our website, so that anyone with an interest in English can buy it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Agarwal has B2C experience from eGurukool and that will come in handy in knowing what to do,&rdquo; says Bihani. &ldquo;My estimate is that we would require close to $500,000-1 million in investment over the next year to move into the B2C segment,&rdquo; says Agarwal. With his partner, he has invested $5 million in Liqvid so far through equity, debt and convertible debt.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;A key challenge for us is competition from Pearson and English language software firms. But we are the only ones focusing on contextual software specific to Indian conditions and that&rsquo;s our biggest differentiator,&rdquo; he adds.

It&rsquo;s a question the 47-year-old adman-turned-entrepreneur should have expected. He started the Mumbai-based company in 1996 with Rs 2.5 crore from investor-friends but didn&rsquo;t take over as managing director until 2000, by when the lack of owner involvement had left its mark: investors started backing out, revenue was just Rs 3 crore, there were no clear financial statements to show where resources were allocated and no marketing and distribution strategies were in place for the company. &ldquo;The company&rsquo;s really started from 2001,&rdquo; says Gupta.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s when Capital Foods became a serious player in the Indian processed foods market and since then, there&rsquo;s been no looking back. It is now a Rs 150-crore company with ambitions of doubling in size in the next three years. It has three brands in the Indian market and is also a significant private label supplier in the export market. Ask Gupta, though, and he lists his biggest challenge as something a little less tangible than numbers in the balance sheet. &ldquo;Changing the mindset of Indian women in the kitchen, getting them to accept processed foods and ready meals has been the toughest part.&rdquo; But, as he admits, the effort has been worth it.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Chindia rules</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">For many urban households now, preparing Chinese food at home means stocking up on sauces and noodles from Ching&rsquo;s Secret. But perhaps &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; is a bit of a misnomer: no native of China makes food that tastes like this, but &ldquo;Chindian&rdquo; is hugely popular in India, from street vendors to fine dining restaurants. &ldquo;In a country like India, the ethnic cuisine changes every 300 km. But not Chinese &mdash; people in all parts of the country eat it,&rdquo; agrees Gupta. &ldquo;And they do not like authentic Chinese, they like Indian Chinese. That is Hakka Chinese.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In keeping with that, Ching&rsquo;s Secret, which sells Hakka Chinese sauces, noodles, seasonings and soups, accounts for 70% of Capital Foods&rsquo; domestic turnover; the remainder comes from Smith &amp; Jones instant noodles and ginger-garlic paste and Raji chutneys and frozen food. Getting to this position wasn&rsquo;t easy. Demonstrations at retail outlets, in offices and at different exhibitions helped familiarise the company&rsquo;s products and the growth in the topline (thanks to the company&rsquo;s export initiative) encouraged Gupta and his team to try new things. &ldquo;Once the money started coming in, we were able to focus on our core business as well. We started innovating and our products&rsquo; presence was visible now,&rdquo; says Gupta.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">By 2006, the company had added instant noodles to its portfolio and was raking in Rs 30 crore a year, which is when it caught the eye of Future Group. In 2006, Future Group&rsquo;s investment arm, Future Ventures, picked up 33% stake in Capital Foods for Rs 13 crore. &ldquo;We saw it as a company with a lot of potential and innovative brands. We like the processed food space and we have liked the way Capital Foods has developed its brand,&rdquo; says KK Rathi, executive director and CEO, Future Ventures. Capital Foods has also been able to impress its investor in more than just quality terms. &ldquo;It had a domestic turnover of just Rs 10 crore in 2006; but today it has a turnover 10 times that number. It has grown more than what was expected.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"We saw Capital Foods as a company with a lot of potential and innovative brands in its bag" - KK Rathi, executive director and CEO, Future Ventures</strong></p>\n<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Much of that growth is due to Capital Foods&rsquo; association with modern trade, which also laid down roots in India over the same period. While Gupta began with Future Group &mdash; at the peak, close to 20% of the company&rsquo;s domestic sales were </span>through Big Bazaar &mdash; now,&nbsp; about 8-9% comes from the Kishore Biyani-backed stores, while substantial sales happen through other players &mdash; Reliance Retail, Hypercity and Spencer&rsquo;s. In all, modern trade accounts for 40% of Capital&rsquo;s domestic turnover. &ldquo;Distribution is the biggest black hole for any food manufacturer in India. We used modern trade to build our business,&rdquo; says Gupta.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>Tasty treat - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">Ramaprasad Chatterjee, AGM, Reliance Retail, explains why Ching&rsquo;s has clicked in the modern trade format. &ldquo;Women don&rsquo;t usually ask for processed food at general trade stores. But in modern trade, they end up buying more things, primarily processed foods, that they desire as well. Modern trade has given Capital Foods and other processed food brands a face of their own,&rdquo; he says. The chain has been selling Capital Foods&rsquo; products for over seven years and is now the single-largest retailer for the company.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7">&nbsp;<strong>Hits and misses</strong></p>\n<p class="p9">While there are no numbers available, most retailers agree that Ching&rsquo;s Secret leads the market in Chinese soy and chilli sauce. As Rachit Mathur, principal, Boston Consulting Group, points out, it&rsquo;s a very niche market, but &ldquo;some of the sauces are quite authentic and different from what conventional restaurants have to offer.&rdquo; Capital Foods&rsquo; other big brand, Smith &amp; Jones, is one among many in the categories in which it is present: instant noodles and ginger-garlic paste. For the latter, Gupta concedes that Dabur is the No.1 player, but claims Smith &amp; Jones is the leader in modern trade sales.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p9"><strong>Tangled affair - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">The story isn&rsquo;t that tasty for the instant noodles range, either. The noodles market in India is close to Rs 4,500 crore, with Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s Maggie as the clear winner with more than 60% market share, followed by ITC with close to 11%; Capital Foods&rsquo; Ching&rsquo;s Secret and Smith &amp; Jones, in contrast, have a minuscule 1.7% share <em>(see: Tangled affair)</em>. Boston Consulting Group&rsquo;s Mathur says, &ldquo;Nestle&rsquo;s Maggi took 14-15 years to create and establish itself in the noodles category but, ITC&rsquo;s Yipee! has made a decent dent in the market in quick time.&rdquo; Capital Foods, too, had grand plans, but market reality forced Gupta to look the other way. &ldquo;We took a terrible beating in the noodles segment. We said to ourselves we can&rsquo;t fight against the giants, let us not even try to do it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>"While price points are important, chaning eating habits will be key for the growing segment" - Rachit Mathur, principal, Boston Consulting Group&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">Capital Foods has now turned its attention to growing the instant soup segment, where it was a late entrant in 2012 but is already the No.3 player. According to Euromonitor, Hindustan Unilever&rsquo;s Knorr leads the Rs 264-crore market with a 63.5% share, followed by Maggi at 22.8% and Ching&rsquo;s Secret&rsquo;s Chinese soups with 11% <em>(see: Hot &amp; spicy)</em>. &ldquo;Soup isn&rsquo;t part of Indian eating habits, but Chinese soups are very popular here,&rdquo; Gupta says. What&rsquo;s helped the company make it to the consumers table is price: at Rs 10 a pack, it is just a third of what Knorr charges. &ldquo;Knorr is more flavourful, but playing the price point is gradually giving Ching&rsquo;s Secret the edge,&rdquo; points out Reliance Retail&rsquo;s Chatterjee. Going forward, further adoption will be the category driver, says Mathur. &ldquo;While price points are important, changing eating habits will be key,&rdquo; he adds. That&rsquo;s where Gupta&rsquo;s marketing expertise will come in handy.</p>\n<p class="p8"><strong>Personal touch</strong></p>\n<p class="p9">With fierce competition in all the categories that Capital Foods operates in, advertising, promotion, distribution and innovation for the company&rsquo;s products are always top of mind for Gupta. More than plain vanilla advertising, he is a votary of promotions. A cooking enthusiast himself &mdash; although, ironically, his forte is Mediterranean cuisine, not Chinese &mdash; Gupta used to accompany the demo team to events in the early days of the company. There&rsquo;s no time for that now, but the company&rsquo;s marketing and promotion budget eats up a third of its turnover. &ldquo;I believe it is the personal touch that speaks for cooking. Watching advertisements about how good a product is will not help as much as experiencing it would,&rdquo; he declares.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p9"><strong>Hot &amp; Spicy - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">Right now, the focus is on selling soup and breaking the notion that soup is a winter food. The summer of 2013 saw Capital Foods invest heavily in billboards and bus-shelter frontage advertising, all promoting soup. &ldquo;I am fighting for the category,&rdquo; says Gupta.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">He is also rejigging distribution. Where earlier, the focus was only on modern trade, general trade was brought into the picture in 2008-2009 and has since been picking up steam. The company is now present at all major modern trade outlets as well as 125,000 general trade stores across four states &mdash; Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab and Karnataka. &ldquo;I have no shame in saying that I am not a national player. When you know that the majority of revenue will come from few pockets in these particular states, you save on distribution cost [currently 14%] by not foraying elsewhere,&rdquo; says Gupta.</p>\n<p class="p6">Capital Foods now has three manufacturing plants that focus on domestic operations, up from just one a decade ago. The company&rsquo;s three brands are also exported to some 10-12 international markets from these units.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p8"><strong>Exports calling</strong></p>\n<p class="p9">Capital Foods turned to exports to bring in much-needed revenue in the first couple of years, when the market was still to warm up to Ching&rsquo;s Secret. Gupta set up the company&rsquo;s second manufacturing unit (the first is at Nashik), in the Kandla Special Economic Zone (SEZ), dedicated to exports. One of the largest ready-meal plants in India, this 100,000 sq ft facility manufactures private label foods for brands such as Swad of the US-based Raja Foods, Pattu of Sabi Foods in Australia and Natco Foods in the UK.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">British supermarket chain Tesco signed on as one of the initial clients for three years &mdash; an achievement Gupta credits to his marketing skills. Similarly, the Chicago-based Raja Foods, which has 51-odd Indian grocery stores across the US, has been associated with the company for a decade now and has even taken a 1.5% stake in Gupta&rsquo;s venture. &ldquo;All our products under the Swad brand are manufactured by Capital Foods,&rdquo; says Swetal Patel, senior vice-president, Raja Foods. &ldquo;We share a friendship more than a business association.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a profitable friendship: 50% of Capital Foods&rsquo; private label business comes from Raja Foods.</p>\n<p class="p6">The second-biggest customer is Sabi Foods, which came on board as a customer in 2005; its brand Pattu now brings in business of over #4 crore a year. &ldquo;We wanted to foray into the processed foods market here in Australia and we found Capital Foods online. We researched about the company and spoke to Gupta a few times. After a couple of meetings, we knew we wanted them to manufacture our products,&rdquo; says Uvaraja Hariramakrishnan, managing director, Sabi Foods. &ldquo;The company&rsquo;s plant meets food safety standards and it keeps on innovating along with its customers,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>"After a couple of meetings, we knew we wanted them [Capital Foods] to manufacture our products" - Uvaraja Hariramakrishnan, managing director, Sebi Foods</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">About 3% of Capital&rsquo;s turnover is currently devoted to research and development and the company has a nine-member team of flavourists, chefs and food technologists. The latest innovation is in Gupta&rsquo;s pet project &mdash; soups &mdash; where the company has created a new flavour, schezchow, blending manchow and schezwan. For its private label customers, the R&amp;D team has combined flavours of three Gujarati communities &mdash; Surti, Charotar and Kathiawadi &mdash; into heat-and-eat patra. &ldquo;And Indian community loves it here,&rdquo; says Patel.</p>\n<p class="p6">When the company first started the export unit, exports accounted for 70% of Capital&rsquo;s revenue. That proportion has been steadily dropping over the years. &ldquo;Getting into exports was a strategic decision to bring in cash into the company. It does not affect our core business in India,&rdquo; Gupta explains. Indeed, over the past five years, exports has remained stable at around 25-30% of revenue. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p8"><strong>Future plans</strong></p>\n<p class="p9">Where does Capital Foods go from here? For starters, it&rsquo;s all about soup. From the current Rs 35 crore, Gupta wants Ching&rsquo;s Secret soups to be a Rs 100-crore brand by 2015, even as its domestic business grows and exports continue at current levels. Gupta admits that it is easier and far more profitable to concentrate on the private label business. While the company&rsquo;s overall Ebitda margin is 18%, the export Ebitda margin is significantly higher at 28%, with domestic margins at just 15%. Gupta says the domestic operations are saddled with additonal distribution and marketing expenses. But, he adds, &ldquo;I built a brand and now I am going to make it bigger.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p6">He may have to do that without the support of the Future Group. There have been media reports about Future Ventures seeking an exit from Capital Foods. Rathi neither confirms nor denies the rumour, though he points to a recent development: Capital Foods no longer gets the bulk of its modern trade business from Future Group. The market buzz is that Future is exiting the business soon and the same stake will be bought by New York-based Invus Group. Only time will tell if that happens or not but, for now, Gupta agrees that finding the right new partner will be a challenge. &ldquo;We want a partner who buys the stake that Biyani holds, but gives us as much freedom as he granted us. Unless that happens, things will be difficult for us,&rdquo; says Gupta. &ldquo;You cannot force a new food culture on a food-culture strong country like India.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>', 'Private label company Capital Foods is aspiring to play a bigger role in the organised FMCG arena with its soup and noodle brands', '22', '', 0, '', 'secret-sauce-427', 421, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Secret sauce ', 'Private label company Capital Foods is aspiring to play a bigger role in the organised FMCG arena with its soup and noodle brands', '', '', '', 'Capital Foods'',Ching''s Secret,Smith & Jones', 0, NULL, '2015-02-05 18:10:33', '2015-02-05 18:27:16', '2013-11-23', 0),
(428, 16, '', 'Miles to go', '<p class="p1"><span class="s1">O</span>n April 13, the world&rsquo;s largest two-wheeler maker Hero Motocorp shocked the market by announcing a five-year warranty across its motorcycles/scooters purchase (five years or 70,000 km in case of motorcycles and five years or 50,000 km for scooters). Hero broke the norm of offering a year or two of warranty on a two-wheeler. It was seen as a strong marketing move from a company that had lost its key technology partner, Honda, and was keen on protecting its market share and leadership.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Six months later, the numbers are not as groundbreaking when compared to the move, with Hero&rsquo;s domestic sales having remained flattish in the past two quarters. According to Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, Hero sold 2.5 million motorcycles between April and September this year in domestic market against 2.6 million in same period last year. Over the past six months, Hero&rsquo;s motorcycle market share increased from 54% at the beginning of FY14 to 54.1% in Q1FY14, but declined to 48.7% at the end of Q2FY14, according to a report by ICICI Direct.</p>\n<p class="p3">But Hero&rsquo;s marketing head defends the numbers. &ldquo;We bucked the trend in the first half of FY14. Retail volumes were up 7% without any new launches, while the industry grew at only 3%. The warranty scheme, along with other factors, contributed to this,&rdquo; says Anil Dua, senior VP, sales, marketing &amp; customer care, Hero Motocorp. He elaborates further that the ten months in question, other than October and November, are non-festive months. &ldquo;But for the first time, we registered 5 lakh and 5.5 lakh retail sales in the non-festive months of April and May.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">However, analysts caution that the momentum may not continue beyond a point. &ldquo;In the first quarter of FY14, this scheme has certainly helped them gain some incremental volumes. But the fact remains that after parting with Honda, the company has been losing market share and is yet to come up with entirely new products,&rdquo; points out Mitul Shah, analyst from Karvy Stock Broking. But Dua insists that market share loss wasn&rsquo;t the consideration for launching the warranty scheme. It was more a part of brand-building. We have done extremely well to retain our market share.&rdquo; More importantly, Dua points out that the offer has not been matched by any competitors. &ldquo;There is a cost attached to it and a lot of homework involved,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Motorcycles in the 75-100 cc range with models such as Splendor and Passion continue to be the bread &amp; butter for Hero, contributing 75% to its sales. Surjit Arora, analyst with Prabhudas Lilladher, points out, &ldquo;On a year-to-year comparison, last year, Splendor&rsquo;s numbers were weak. But this year, Splendor sales have picked up and that could be owing to the warranty scheme.&rdquo; Dua also believes that. But then, the real test for Hero is still to come. The first two-wheeler from Hero&rsquo;s own stable will be launched in the coming quarter, and that will be critical for Hero to pull in the numbers.&nbsp;</p>', 'Hero Motocorp''s five-year warranty scheme is yet to rev up the auto major''s sales', '9', '', 0, '', 'miles-to-go-428', 422, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Miles to go ', 'Hero Motocorp''s five-year warranty scheme is yet to rev up the auto major''s sales', '', '', '', 'Hero Motocorp', 0, NULL, '2015-02-06 11:24:31', '2015-02-06 11:28:47', '2013-11-23', 0),

(430, 20, '', 'Getting high', '<p class="p1">A&nbsp;month is a long time in the market, a couple of months even longer. As August was nearing its end, it felt like investors only had FMCG and pharmaceutical stocks to hide behind. The Sensex hit an intra-day low of 17,500 and the rupee cratered to just over 69. Now all that seems like a bad dream as investors seem to be itching to release balloons with the &lsquo;25,000&rsquo; mark painted on. Well, that is what the Sensex is slowly but surely expected to trade at soon. The fear factor that prevailed in August was driven by talk of the Federal Reserve draining away a fraction of its generous liquidity. That &lsquo;fear&rsquo; being done away with, it is time to celebrate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">&lsquo;Fundamentals be damned, give us liquidity any day&rsquo;, seems to be the rallying cry in the markets. According to Ambareesh Baliga, managing partner, global wealth management, Edelweiss, there is a stark contrast between market sentiment and ground realities. &ldquo;The rally has been driven by global liquidity, the expectation that the RBI governor will turn things around and also better than expected second quarter earnings. But we are not quite there yet when it comes to India&rsquo;s macro <br /> scenario,&rdquo; he says. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">As liquidity is expected to be plenty, the expectation is that there will be enough capital flows to finance the current account deficit in FY14. On the back of this optimism, the deficit is expected to be around $70 billion or even lower. However, Parag Parikh, founder of PPFAS AMC, believes that, &ldquo;while the CAD may have improved due to the government clampdown on gold imports, reducing customs collections may adversely affect the fiscal deficit target.&rdquo; He also feels it is incorrect to ascribe the rally to good corporate earnings as, &ldquo;in the short run, the correlation between stock prices and corporate earnings is tenuous at best.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Change of guard - Graphic</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">That said, let&rsquo;s take a look at the sectors driving the current rally. This run has been powered largely by IT, FMCG, and pharma. Why so? FMCG is a defensive play and the others have been beneficiaries of currency depreciation. This is in stark contrast to the sectors (capital goods, banking, commodities and power) that drove the bull run in 2008, when the Sensex posted its last closing high. In fact, the frontrunners back then are laggards today (<em>see: Change of guard</em>). Why so? Baliga says these sectors gained the most from the heady growth in 2008 and so have been impacted by the downturn the most. The banking sector has been dragged down by high NPAs and metals have been impacted by the slowdown, leading to reduced demand.</p>\n<p class="p2">The moot question, then, is will this narrow rally transform into a broad-based one? Analysts are banking on external drivers as the domestic inflation overhang continues. &ldquo;If growth in the US and Europe picks up, it should lend some steam to the rally. While a recovery is happening, Europe is currently growing at only 0.25%. This is not good enough,&rdquo; points out Aneesh Srivastava, chief investment officer, IDBI Federal Life Insurance, who has a target of 20,800 for the Sensex for end-FY14. Baliga, who has a target of 6,500 on the higher side and 5,900 on the lower side for the Nifty for end- FY14, believes that a strong government at the helm of affairs after the upcoming general elections could smoothen things out. That better be the case, as the current rally seems to be counting it in.&nbsp;</p>', 'The Sensex is trading near its all-time high.

(431, 20, '', 'Wind beneath its wings', '<p class="p1">Circa 1983. Two wannabe entrepreneurs, Clyde Cooper and Khushroo Dubash, meet at a cafeteria in Mumbai and consider possible businesses. They settle on setting up an express courier service, for which they rope in Tushar Jani, an established entrepreneur. With a combined kitty of Rs 30,000, sourced from personal savings and capital, the trio fill the need for a quality private courier operator by forging ties with the UK-based courier operator, Gelco Express International. By November 1983, India&rsquo;s first domestic and international on-board courier service, Blue Dart Courier Services, better known as Blue Dart Express, was open for business.</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>Express growth - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Cut to today. Blue Dart ranks as India&rsquo;s premier courier and express package distribution company, covering 220 countries and accounting for 47% of the Indian air express (express courier sent by air) market. It also accounts for 13% of the ground express segment (packages or goods sent by road or rail transport). To top it all, it has raked in post-tax profit of Rs 187 crore for FY13, the highest in 17 years, making it the top dog in the express industry. &ldquo;Over the years, Blue Dart, as a brand, has evolved to become synonymous with value, quality, speed, responsiveness and <span class="s2">service experience,&rdquo; boasts Anil Khanna, managing director, Blue Dart Express. But then, Khanna is not dishing out marketing spiel, as the growth the express major has dished out over the past and in recent years, despite the turbulence, is nothing less than commendable (<em>see: Express growth</em>).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Charging ahead</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">To understand how Blue Dart has achieved all this, take a closer look at the express industry in India. The Rs 10,870-crore industry is evenly split between organised and unorganised players. The organised accounts for just 48% of the market. This can be further sub-divided into two categories &mdash; air express and ground express. The Rs 2,340-crore air express industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13% over FY13-15. Ground express, with a market size of Rs 2,870 crore, is expected to see a 19% CAGR over the same period.</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>Top of the pack - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">While a number of players such as DTDC, FedEx, First Flight and Gati exist, none has achieved the extensive reach or size and scale of Blue Dart in the air express segment. Blue Dart services 33,751 locations domestically and has a ground fleet of 7,719 vehicles. Its nearest competitor, DTDC, has a 12% market share in the air express segment and a reach of 11,000-plus locations. What explains the wide gap? Blue Dart&rsquo;s first-mover advantage and extensive reach, along with the fact that it is the only operator to have its own fleet of seven aircraft (for courier delivery through subsidiary Blue Dart Aviation), has given it the edge. &ldquo;Blue Dart has made a name for itself in providing customised solutions for its customers. The investment done at the front end, the hub-and-spoke model it has in place and the fact that through Blue Dart Aviation it has its own airline for delivering airmail have enabled it to differentiate itself from others,&rdquo; says Sonam Udasi, head of research at IDBI Capital.</p>\n<p class="p7"><strong>"Blue Dart has made a name for itself in providing customised solutions for its customers" - Sonam Udasi, head of research, IDBI Capital&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">The big fillip for Blue Dart came in 2005, when international courier giant DHL acquired a controlling 81% stake, thus giving it access to far greater markets and geographies and enabling it to leverage DHL&rsquo;s extensive worldwide network. But even before that, Blue Dart was in a league of its own due to its continuous investment and emphasis on technology. In 1991, the company introduced Cosmat ITM, an ERP system which taps into the company database over a wide area and tracks shipments, a key advantage in an industry where timeliness of delivery is the order of the day. In the ground express segment, Dart Surface Line, a door-to-door ground distribution express service, and Dart Surface Line Plus, for bulkier shipments that are more time-sensitive, have worked well. &ldquo;Both these products have helped the company provide economical, time-bound door-to-door ground distribution services to 34,000 locations in India,&rdquo; says Amit Aggarwal, analyst with Kotak Securities. Additional features such as freight on delivery and real-time tracking have helped it garner market share in the ground segment from 6% in FY06 to 13% in FY13. Besides the cash-on-delivery services, temperature-controlled logistics for pharmacies and hospitals has been another attempt to widen its service bouquet.</p>\n<p class="p7"><strong>"The ground and air express segments are the most lucrative. This is where you have the highest yields" - Abhishek Chakraborty, executive director, DTDC Courier &amp; Cargo</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">Abhishek Chakraborty, executive director, DTDC Courier &amp; Cargo, believes that to be successful in the express courier industry, it is necessary to provide customised solutions to clients. &ldquo;The ground and air express segments are the most lucrative. This is where you have the highest yields and premium consumers, such as corporates. But, to be successful, any organisation has to position itself as an end-to-end solutions provider. As long as you are doing that, you will do well, irrespective of whether you are focusing on the ground or air segment.&rdquo; According to Kotak&rsquo;s Aggarwal, Blue Dart has also built a reputation for secure delivery of shipments, while others are not seen to be as trustworthy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Game-changer</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">Nearly 94% of Blue Dart&rsquo;s customers are institutional customers. Chakraborty says, &ldquo;IT, consumer durables, pharmaceuticals, auto and BFSI sectors are the fastest growing verticals for express courier companies and are the main driver of volumes. So any good market player will want to focus on these.&rdquo; One sector, in particular, that is seeing good growth and holds potential is the e-commerce space, which is expected to grow to Rs 54,014 crore by 2016. With internet penetration in India now at 11% and set to increase in tier 2 and 3 towns and cities, the scope for online transactions is steadily increasing and the sector is growing at a CAGR of 40%. With clients such as Homeshop 18, Flipkart, Snapdeal and Myntra, the e-commerce space contributes 10% of total revenues for Blue Dart, which enjoys 35% market share, according to a Kotak Securities report.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>"GST will make it viable to simplify distribution network and result in economies of large-scale operations" - Anil Khanna, managing director, Blue Dart Express</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">But the real game-changer, analysts believe, will be the implementation of a uniform goods and service tax (GST) across the country. Avoidance of double taxation will reflect in lower pricing of manufactured products, leading to price reductions. &ldquo;GST will make it economically viable to simplify distribution network and result in economies of large-scale operations,&rdquo; says Khanna. Manufacturers can do away with multiple warehouses &mdash; a strategy to save on multiple taxes &mdash; leading to better supply chain management and better efficiencies for logistics players. If in place of multiple warehouses, a manufacturer establishes one central warehouse, then Blue Dart&rsquo;s fleet can be parked near that location. Besides, the incidence of trucks running at half or less than full capacity will be reduced since all the goods are stored in that one warehouse. So, fixed costs will remain constant but revenue per truck will increase. Given that nearly 80% of Blue Dart&rsquo;s costs are fixed in nature, rising volumes will result in higher, more operational leverage. &ldquo;Having GST in place means having fewer warehouses at centralised locations with optimum fleet loading capacity, plus it will bring down fixed costs. This is a very significant move for both logistics players and retailers,&rdquo; says Bharat Chhoda, associate vice-president, research, at ICICI Direct. Better road infrastructure and logistics parks in future will further enhance this.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Turbulence ahead?</strong></p>\n<p class="p6">Not all is hunky dory, though. The fate of the logistics sector is heavily tied to the state of the economy &mdash; typically, the sector grows at a multiple of 2.2 times the GDP growth rate. In the weak current economic environment, all logistics players have been hit hard, and Blue Dart is no exception. In the first quarter of this fiscal, declining demand leading to lower volumes and increase in fuel costs saw operating margins decline to 10.7% from 12% last year. But Chhoda of ICICI Direct believes the company&rsquo;s volumes and margins have not been impacted as much as other players. &ldquo;This is because as far as margins are concerned, other players don&rsquo;t have their own dedicated airline fleet and so have to use the belly cargo of private airlines, in which they incur significant costs. But since Blue Dart owns its own fleet, it does not have to bear this burden. On the volume front, Blue Dart&rsquo;s institutional clients sign annual volume contracts for express freight delivery. Even if they don&rsquo;t hit the agreed volume, they still have to pay the charges. So revenues don&rsquo;t decline,&rdquo; says Chhoda.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7">High operating costs, however, remains a challenge. Aviation turbine fuel constitutes 20% of Blue Dart&rsquo;s overall costs, which has been further compounded by a weak rupee. Not just that, as Khanna puts it, &ldquo;The depreciating currency has also impacted aircraft lease and maintenance and other allied input costs as well. Though we have a mechanism called the currency adjustment factor (additional fee payable every time the dollar appreciates&nbsp; by a rupee), we have nonetheless suffered.&rdquo; Though sales in Q2FY14 were up 13% at Rs 471 crore, PAT fell 7% to Rs 30 crore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7"><strong>Down to earth - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">The management is, however, banking on growing volumes to offset margin pressure. &ldquo;Growth in sectors such as pharmaceutical, automotive, consumer electronics, financial services and e-retailing has given a further impetus to the industry. We are further focusing on tier 2 and tier 3 cities, which are important not only from the consumption point of view but also from the production angle. Besides, we are also looking at SMEs as a bigger opportunity to us,&rdquo; says Khanna. Not surprising then that Blue Dart increased its market share in Air Express from 46% to 49% and in Ground Express from 11.8% to 13.3% over the past three months. &ldquo;In recent year, it has also ramped up the number of ground hubs from 20 to 65, leading to better operational dexterity and reach,&rdquo; says Chhoda.</p>\n<p class="p7">For now, most analysts are bullish on Blue Dart&rsquo;s stock, given the firm is debt-free and has an asset-light business model, since almost 80% of its vehicle fleet is outsourced and warehouses, hubs and aircraft have all been leased. They estimate revenues and net profit to show a CAGR of close to 13.5% and 14.5% between FY13-15. At Rs 2,726 a share, the stock is trading at a forward multiple of 37 times, and is up 13% for FY14. Interest costs will also rise as the company intends to issue non-convertible debentures. If economic growth does not revive soon, margin pressure could continue. Against such a backdrop, investors will be better off waiting for a price correction.&nbsp;</p>', 'Despite a challenging macro environment and spiralling costs, express courier major Blue Dart is still flying high.

(433, 24, '', 'Well-versed', '<p class="p1">Poetry comes easily to Prithvi Haldea. In fact, he grew up with it. The 63-year-old chairman of Prime Database remembers his father, an erstwhile <em>jagirdar</em> in Jaipur, sharing his love for poetry with his toddler sons. &ldquo;He used to recite couplets about hope, perseverance and how to be confident and face the world.&rdquo; The magic of those words wasn&rsquo;t lost on Haldea when he set out to build the first database on India&rsquo;s primary markets at a time when no one seemed interested in the idea. Twenty-four years later, having handed over the day-to-day running of his business to son Pranav, Haldea has made his love for Urdu poetry &mdash; <em>shayari</em> and <em>ghazals</em> &mdash; his chief occupation. Ibaadat, the non-profit trust he set up with businessman Naveen Anand, former Doordarshan news presenter Sangeeta Bedi and four others in October 11, works to revive the classics of Urdu poetry by showcasing some of the legends of Hindi cinema.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Ibaadat&rsquo;s office is located on the ground floor in Haldea&rsquo;s apartment building. As chairman of the trust, Haldea says he conducts much of the research that goes into the process. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the time I enjoy the most,&rdquo; he says. That often means many months of sifting through thousands of songs, identifying ones that best represent the poet&rsquo;s versatility, and bringing them to life through a scripted event.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Digging out information and finding authentic sources is as frustrating as it&rsquo;s elusive, thanks to dwindling interest in such poetry over the years, Haldea admits. But it&rsquo;s the kind of work that he is no stranger to. &ldquo;I maintain a daily list of every person I&rsquo;ve met in my life,&rdquo; he says. As a database evangelist for the extended family, he is often called upon during marriages to provide names of prospective invitees. &ldquo;I fulfil this request every year for a relative. My wife&rsquo;s friends, my son&rsquo;s friends, his Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad batchmates, school friends etc. &mdash; each name has been categorised and referenced. And all this is updated daily,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">No wonder that when in February 2008, he heard about Mubarak Begum, a leading Hindi film singer in the &rsquo;50s and &rsquo;60s who was living in penury in a 6x8 ft room in Mumbai&rsquo;s Jogeshwari area, Haldea was able to trace her and convince her to sing again &mdash; but for a select audience of her fans. Proceeds from the event, held in Delhi, were presented to her. It was the trigger for launching Ibaadat. So far, nine such shows have been held in less than two years, featuring the works of Majrooh Sultanpuri, Naushad and Shailendra. Neeraj from Aligarh was the only living poet to be featured so far.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Haldea, like other trustees, puts in his own money for the events, as memberships, sponsorships and ticket sales are not allowed. &ldquo;Money is not a constraint in doing what we want to do,&rdquo; he says. The events are by invitation. Haldea is now looking out for a person to delegate the administration and logistics of the events. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll continue to enjoy identifying the poets, researching their works, shortlisting important and interesting incidents of their lives set around their lyrics and weaving it all into a story. This I don&rsquo;t want to delegate, because it&rsquo;s something I enjoy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">He also wants to turn his attention to identifying current poets and give them a platform. Many of them continue to live in obscurity, doing day jobs for a living. &ldquo;They get paid a pittance at <em>mushairas</em>,&rdquo; he says. Haldea also plans to start a <em>shayari</em> competition in colleges. &ldquo;The larger motive is to take Urdu poetry to the youth and make it enjoyable for them,&rdquo; he says. &nbsp;</p>', 'Prime Database chairman Prithivi Haldea''s penchant for seeking and organising information marries perfectly with his quest to revive Urdu poetry', '19', '', 0, '', 'well-versed-433', 427, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Well-versed ', 'Prime Database chairman Prithivi Haldea''s penchant for seeking and organising information marries perfectly with his quest to revive Urdu poetry', '', '', '', 'Prima Database,Prithvi Haldea,Urdu poetry,Ibaadat', 0, NULL, '2015-02-06 12:04:58', NULL, '2013-11-23', 0),
(434, 24, '', 'Moving on', '<p class="p1">Of late, I have been reading books that reflect on life and spirituality. I have been investing a lot of my time in understanding the epic <em>Bhagwad Gita</em>; each time you read a verse, you get a different meaning. On a recent flight, I picked up <em>The</em> <em>Shift</em> by Dr Wayne W Dyre. Once I started reading, it was difficult to put the book down as its beautiful narrative unlocked and unfolded the reason behind our human avatar and why we need to connect with our inner self to understand the purpose of life. Going through the book was nothing short of meditation.</p>\n<p class="p3">Life is not complete without a purpose, but more often than not, we get trapped into a world of our self-created egos. As human beings, our greatest lesson is that we are eternal beings impervious to both birth and death, as energy can neither be created nor destroyed. Closely aligned with this is the idea of oneness and surrender. Oneness refers to the stage where we begin to feel a connection to everyone: to the earth, to the universe and ultimately, to the divine. Surrender is the art of giving up your need to control your world.</p>\n<p class="p3">When we &lsquo;shift&rsquo; our perception, we turn towards a new direction in our lives. This learning comes with the realisation that what was relevant or important in our lives yesterday is no longer valid and of any importance today. Life has to have some meaning at every point. We should dedicate a part of our lives to service and give back to society without expectation of reward by simply practicing radical humility. One of the classic examples is that of the ocean, which lies low and yet gains tremendous strength as all rivers and streams eventually flow into the ocean.</p>\n<p class="p3">It does not matter how far we have travelled on the road of the false self &mdash; the moment we realise that the path is not leading us to a sense of purpose and significance, we need to get back on course and make our lives meaningful. This is a &lsquo;shift&rsquo; &mdash; a shift from entitlement to humility of service, from control to trust in yourself, in others and in the mystery of creation and from attachment to letting go.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Despite the availability of so much technology and so many resources to assist us in our routines, life has only got busier over the years. Hence, it is all the more important to pause regularly and give ourselves some time to ponder over our actions and our beliefs, giving life a more meaningful role. Dr Dyre&rsquo;s <em>Shift</em> will certainly help us reach that goal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Insights</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">When takeovers take away jobs</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1">How much do successful private equity buyouts really contribute to a company&rsquo;s performance?

The researchers also noted that the improvement in the firm&rsquo;s performance after the acquisition was in part due to these job cuts. Though new jobs are definitely created as well, with fresh hiring carried out a year or two after the takeover, the net pay per worker dips sharply after a buyout.

It&rsquo;s not the kind of thing technocrats do and Analjt Singh is too stiff upper lip for this to be anything more than an accidental chance, so it was probably fate. Any way you look at it, the forested acres roused Singh into thinking about his retirement (even though it was years away) and in a swift deal, Malsi Estate switched hands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Indians have always had a deep-rooted relationship with land. For several years, Malsi Estate was no more than a family orchard, until talks with the Oberoi group for a luxury resort on the property fell through. That was around 2007, but the idea stuck and in 2009, Max India scion and maverick Veer Singh came on board to develop the estate as a wellness retreat.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s difficult to imagine Veer in a corporate environment. He wears a white <em>kurta pyjama</em> of organically grown and handspun khadi, but is sensualist enough to enjoy his music &mdash; Lionel Richie sang at his sister&rsquo;s wedding. He plays a few instruments himself, loves architecture and art and enjoys the fine things in life. Besides, he&rsquo;s level-headed &mdash; even ambitious &mdash; about his business plans. The spa business might appear simple, but is multi-layered and complex and could serve well as an alternate healing platform for his healthcare interests, even though the two remain independent businesses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The inspiration for the spa came from the 21-acre estate itself. Its sal forests provide a healing environment, so to think of anything else here would have been anathema.

Properties that follow will be located in different regions of the world, and the rollout after Malsi Estate will definitely be overseas. For now, 90 rooms, suites and villas and 50 treatment and consultation rooms are under completion. And Veer, leading his team of 125, has been at hand to pick even the electricians and plumbers.

(438, 12, '', 'On the razor''s edge', '<p class="p1">Success can sometimes be a close shave, without one realising it. Ask Harshit Kochar, whose family owns the Vi-John brand of personal care and grooming products. He remembers how a few years ago, a dealer came in and congratulated him for Vi-John being rated as India&rsquo;s largest selling shaving cream by volume. It was a research study conducted by a trade magazine and the dealer told him how proud he was to be associated with the company. &ldquo;At that point, we didn&rsquo;t know how big we had become,&rdquo; says Vi-John MD Kochar, who joined the business in 1998.</p>\n<p class="p3">At Rs 250 crore in sales turnover (FY13), Vi-John&rsquo;s parent company Maja Healthcare is hardly a match for heavyweights such as P&amp;G (Gillette and Old Spice), HUL (Axe) Godrej Consumer Products, Colgate Palmolive and Raymond (Park Avenue). But its mass-oriented philosophy and a celebrity endorsement overdrive in recent years has given this Delhi-based family business a national presence and a doubling of sales volumes in the past three years.</p>\n<p class="p3">In a country where a shave for men mostly meant using soaps and shaving rounds for a very long time, Vi-John&rsquo;s shaving cream found prompt acceptance, especially at salons and streetside barbers. &ldquo;Barbers would use the lowest cost option available, and we were the dominant brand in the category in those days,&rdquo; says Vimal Pande, CEO, Vi-John Group. This sealed its position as a low cost brand over the years, but also kept it small for a very long time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Family affair</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The foundation for the business was laid in 1960 by current chairman Bhupinder Singh&rsquo;s father Suchet Singh Kochar at their home in Delhi. Making vanishing cream, hair oil, cold creams and talcum powder and other such products, he mostly sold these at the wholesale market at Sadar Bazar nearby, which fed markets all over India. He also set up a stall in Chandni Chowk in front of what is now Shri Ram &amp; Sons, running it for nine years. As business grew, Kochar bought over a factory in GT Karnal Road sometime in 1982. Two years later, the firm began making shaving cream. Kochar named it Vi-John, an oddly English-sounding name whose origins no one in the family is able to explain.</p>\n<p class="p3">After expanding to eight small-scale units around Delhi, the Kochars began chalking out a larger game plan. The first large factory was rented out in Baddi, HP, in 2005 and a year later, Vi-John had its own factory. Today, its four manufacturing units in Baddi produce the cosmetics range, while the one in Kathua, J&amp;K, makes mosquito coils under the Cobra brand name. With over 700 employees now across its offices in 140 districts, Bhupinder Singh Kochar says one thing hasn&rsquo;t changed: &ldquo;Even today, our products are in short supply.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Frothy growth - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Some of that could have to do with its aggressive advertising roll-out, which the company had kept away from for many years. Though advertising had already begun in the early &lsquo;90s, things changed with the first celebrity endorsement in 2004 by veteran actor Dharmendra for a campaign for Upvan Cool Oil. Aimed at audiences in Bihar and UP, the campaign ran on DD National for some time. Communication stayed regional until May 2009, when actor Bipasha Basu was roped in for Vi-John Feather Touch hair removal cream. It was its first test of how full-scale advertising would work, and a bold step for a company of its stature and size. &ldquo;We thought of taking the best celebrities and go all out, rather than in small bursts. This way, reaching out to our target group was much easier,&rdquo; says Pande. What followed was a string of Bollywood endorsements by Shah Rukh Khan, Emraan Hashmi and Sonali Bendre. Signing up Khan was perhaps its most audacious move, but one that paid off well. &ldquo;There was a two-fold increase in realisations for the company. We became more profitable.&rdquo; Since then, the group&rsquo;s advertising spends have been on the rise, with around Rs 15 crore spent in FY13 and at least #18-20 crore budgeted for FY14.</p>\n<p class="p3">Being a volume player, this puts pressure on the group&rsquo;s margins and its ability to keep its prices low, something it prides itself on. &ldquo;We are the lowest priced per gram in the shaving cream segment,&rdquo; says Harshit Kochar. Typically, leading brands of shaving creams retail at Rs 50-55 for a 70 gm pack, while Vi-John sells at Rs 35 for 125 gm. &ldquo;Our target group is the mass market,&rdquo; says Pande. This approach means its dominance is built on a consumer base that&rsquo;s highly price-sensitive. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a very sound approach,&rdquo; says Bengaluru-based brand consultant Harish Bijoor. &ldquo;Shaving cream is also a style statement today. Players who play the cost game will only be &lsquo;stepping stone&rsquo; brands. New consumers will enter the category with them, and move on to upper-end brands.&rdquo; Bijoor says this should be a temporary philosophy if the firm has to move up the value chain in its businesses. &ldquo;Such brands do more service to the competition than to the consumer,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Pricing it right?</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">It&rsquo;s hard to say how long Vi-John&rsquo;s price warrior strategy will continue to pay off. But there&rsquo;s little doubt that rural and small town India is where the next round of growth will come from for most consumer goods companies. From that logic alone, Vi-John appears well-positioned for now. Thanks to its push through the wholesale route for well over four decades, nearly 70% of its sales come from tier 2 and tier 3 markets, says national sales manager Jagdish Malwani. But the bottom of pyramid (BoP) market is one that promises to be crowded and hyper competitive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Moreover, although it now makes shaving gel and shave foam to serve an emerging demographic &mdash; male youth aged 16 years and above, down from 35 years earlier &mdash; Vi-John hasn&rsquo;t yet promoted these aggressively, and associations with its past still cling on. &ldquo;Even today, we are the largest selling brand (by volume) at salons,&rdquo; says Pande. Barbershops or salons are usually serviced by salon wholesalers, who sell products specifically for such outlets. Apart from shaving creams and cosmetic products for use in salons, these wholesalers provide services such as sharpening of scissors and other instruments. Vi-John reaches out to roughly 10,000 of them and to over one lakh salons in the country.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">To get ahead in value market share, Vi-John&rsquo;s main challenge now is brand-building and new product development. The family&rsquo;s third generation is mostly in charge now and key roles have been assigned across the group&rsquo;s three business lines &mdash; FMCG, real estate (Kochar Infrastructure) and liquor (Arian Breweries &amp; Distilleries). While Tarun Kochar handles exports, liquor and packaging, Achin is in charge of procurement and new product development, with Prateek managing the fragrances R&amp;D. The youngest, Gavin, is currently studying cosmetics chemical engineering at the London College of Fashion. The company has also been picking up senior professionals from across the industry. Pande, who came with experience from stints at Emami, PepsiCo and SC Johnson, was among the brand&rsquo;s first big hires a few years ago, followed by Malwani, who comes from a similar background in FMCG.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Branching out</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Over the past few years, the company has entered into new product categories such as deodorants, shaving foam (launched four months back) and an antiseptic cream introduced in October. &ldquo;We are the second-largest selling hair removal cream in India and number one in the north,&rdquo; claims Harshit. But even though the product range aimed at female consumers has been steadily expanding, the Vi-John association poses a problem, he admits: &ldquo;Our brand perception is still largely male.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Given that the business grew not so much through a well-crafted strategy but by simply entering new categories to meet demand as and when it arose, this is not surprising. This chaotic approach led to a rather unwieldy product portfolio and a complex structure of brands and sub-brands such as St John&rsquo;s and Archies, which can be confusing. Further, the choice of brand names reflects its low-end appeal. So while its Cobra range of perfumes have names like Cobra True Man, Cobra Real Man and Agent Cobra, deodorants come in Kill Her, Naughty and Juicy variants. Then there are aftershaves and perfumes under the Vi-John brand umbrella as well, with names such as Delicious Night, Embrace and Black Currents. There&rsquo;s even Vi-John toothpaste.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Might of its own- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Some of this is being streamlined and simplified, says Dibyendu Chakraborty, founder of Archimedes Consultants, who is working on the packaging and communication aspects of its newly launched antiseptic cream, Boro Shield. &ldquo;They have an uncanny sense of business and understand the importance of building brands,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">In 2006, a rethink was done and a sales system was put in place to focus on direct distribution. &ldquo;We started moving away from our dependence on wholesalers,&rdquo; says Pande. In 2011, the company rolled out its national rural expansion plan. &ldquo;We started creating a network in rural areas, appointing super stockists and distributors for towns of over 5,000 population,&rdquo; says Pande. The sales force was ramped up to 250 and has grown to over 600 now, which includes direct or company sales force and indirect or those employed by distributors. This has helped the company reach out to 3,500 FMCG distributors with direct coverage in 3 lakh outlets and an overall retail presence in around 1.5 million outlets.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Full steam ahead</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Traditionally, Vi-John has enjoyed immense popularity in the northern states of UP, Rajasthan and Bihar, with 40% of sales coming from these regions. Pande says the focus is now to ramp up direct presence in markets in the south and west, where it has been weak so far. Contribution from the north is already down to 35% and could come down further as other regions grow. &ldquo;The south has been a low-hanging fruit,&rdquo; says Pande.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">To improve its urban reach, Vi-John began tapping modern trade less than a year ago. Apart from reaching out to urban consumers through leading retail chains such as Auchan and Easy Day, the company has also added to its urban wholesale distribution network through Best Price Modern Wholesale, Metro Cash &amp; Carry, Carrefour Wholesale and Reliance Cash &amp; Carry. While these mainly cater to city retailers, Pande says some of the supply spills over into rural markets as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Working up a lather - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Yet, growth comes with its own set of problems for every firm. &ldquo;A company like us has to fight on two fronts &mdash; the organised and the unorganised players,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Small manufacturers try and sell at a price advantage. This is specifically an issue in rural markets,&rdquo; says Pande. And in what could be a sign that the firm has made it big, fake products with similar looking or sounding names such as V-John and Bi-John often crop up in upcountry markets.</p>\n<p class="p3">Sticking to its lowest price-per-gram position therefore has been a tough call in recent years. &ldquo;Even for the first few years after we began to advertise, we didn&rsquo;t raise prices,&rdquo; says Harshit Kochar. For a self-funded business that has grown to 700-odd employees across its plants and 140 sales offices, this is a feat that could either be considered remarkable or merely fortuitous. However, Pande offers an explanation: &ldquo;We have good sourcing skills and we keep our costs under control.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">One major cost area was trade margins. These are being brought down gradually every year. Earlier, wholesale margins used to be at 10%, with an additional cash discount of 2%. Now, that&rsquo;s down to 7%. Retail margins stood at a massive 30-40% and have been brought down to 25%, though fragrances and deodorants still work on 35-40% margins, in line with the category&rsquo;s norms.</p>\n<p class="p3">New products are also helping shore up the company&rsquo;s topline. Deodorants are among the fastest-growing categories in personal care and the Cobra brand is marking its presence there as well. The revenue logic is clear. &ldquo;A 125 gm pack of shaving cream lasts up to four months, whereas a deodorant can of 150 ml could be used up in just 15 days. So usage is faster and volumes will be more from this category,&rdquo; explains Pande. Share of shaving cream is 33% in the group&rsquo;s portfolio, but Pande says newer categories like deodorants and antiseptic cream, which it launched with actress Minissha Lamba as the endorser, will bring its contribution down.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It is also discovering demand in the most unlikely places. Thanks to its wholesale approach over the years, Vi-John&rsquo;s products now command a loyal following in select markets. For instance, its Saffron Green fairness cream is already selling briskly in Tamil Nadu. It&rsquo;s a similar case with the Cobra deodorant range in Kerala. &ldquo;We just have to feed the demand,&rdquo; says Pande. Three months ago, the group began regional advertising in the southern states and in West Bengal. Overall revenues are expected to touch Rs 300 crore this year, says Pande, adding that the plank will remain largely the same. &ldquo;BoP consumers will always be a larger audience for us.&rdquo; There was news of ICICI Venture picking up a stake in the firm last year, but Pande is dismissive. &ldquo;They came to us, but we were not interested,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We are looking to buy brands. Maybe then we&rsquo;ll seek funding.&rdquo; For now, Vi-John seems to be working up a good lather.&nbsp;</p>', 'Can Vi-John succeed in its attempt to straddle the mass and premium shaving cream markets?', '19', '', 0, '', 'on-the-razors-edge-438', 432, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'On the razor''s edge ', 'Can Vi-John succeed in its attempt to straddle the mass and premium shaving cream markets?', '', '', '', 'Vi-John,Maja Healthcare', 0, NULL, '2015-02-06 12:27:51', '2015-02-06 12:45:19', '2013-12-21', 0);

(439, 16, '', 'Standing still', '<p class="p1">In business, a good first impression goes a long way. Nobody knows this better than real estate developers, who often operate out of plush offices &mdash; a grand extension of the structures that they build.</p>\n<p class="p3">Vipin Bansal&rsquo;s office, though, is a study in contrast. The chief executive officer of DB Realty works out of a small cabin in the basement of a complex in Goregaon, a distant Mumbai suburb. Going by its low ceiling height, his office could well have been a garage in its previous avatar. Bansal heads a company that has been a pretty aggressive acquirer of land in Mumbai, so why is he keeping a low profile? Co-workers say Bansal doesn&rsquo;t care for a ritzy office because he is constantly on the move. Every day, he shuttles between his basement &lsquo;office&rsquo; and the company&rsquo;s residential projects in the city. Countless trips to the state secretariat to get work done are also de rigueur.</p>\n<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Insiders say Bansal wants to make up for lost time &mdash; the last two years have been particularly tough for the company. In early 2011, the firm&rsquo;s promoters Shahid Balwa and Vinod Goenka were arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in relation with the 2G spectrum scam. DB Realty firm, Swan Telecom, had been allotted 2G spectrum licences for 15 circles</span> and it was alleged that DB used its partnership firm Dynamix Realty to transfer over Rs 200 crore to television channel Kalaignar TV, owned by DMK chief M Karunanidhi&rsquo;s wife and daughter. The CBI and the Enforcement Directorate suspect that this investment was a quid pro quo for getting spectrum allotted through the then DMK telecom minister A Raja. While the real estate business itself is not bereft of shady elements, DB&rsquo;s competitors crib that it leverages its proximity to the powers-that-be to its benefit, and gets project files cleared quickly. That perceived heft, however, couldn&rsquo;t stop the Maharashtra government from scrutinising many deals after the promoters got enmeshed in the spectrum imbroglio.</p>\n<p class="p4">In February 2011, chief minister Prithviraj Chavan stopped DB from redeveloping a plot of land on which the Yerwada police station stood. Despite protests from the Pune police department, the plot was to be re-developed on a public-private partnership basis by DB and the state home ministry. In return, DB was to relocate the police station to a plot on the Pune-Ahmednagar Road and build quarters for the policemen. Several other projects got nixed or ran into rough weather as well. DB&rsquo;s plan to redevelop 35 acres of Mumbai&rsquo;s infamous red-light district Kamathipura, a JV township in Pune and the redevelopment of a 100-acre government colony at Bandra.</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>Shaky ground</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">The scam allegations hit DB Realty pretty hard. its stock fell from around Rs 450 in February 2010 to as low as Rs 45 by December 2011. While the company was still reeling from the shock of the arrests of its promoters, it was hit by another crisis in the form of new development control regulations (DCR) for Mumbai. Because of the uncertainty surrounding DCR guidelines, developers slowed down the pace of execution of ongoing projects, which in turn affected their revenue recognition. Since receivables from customers are linked to the construction progress achieved, cash inflow was impacted too.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7"><strong>Prime concentration- graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">Bansal believes that the 2G scam allegations didn&rsquo;t affect the company as much as the change in DCR did. When he took over as CEO in September 2012, one of the first things he did was chase approvals for the company&rsquo;s projects. &ldquo;The government announced the DCR amendments in early 2012, but clarity came only during the middle of 2012. My first priority was to get things moving,&rdquo; says Bansal.</p>\n<p class="p4">Amit Anwani, a real estate analyst with KC Securities, says while DCR guidelines did affect developers, the slowdown in launches by developers, including DB, was more because of falling sales and cash flow problems. &ldquo;It is not like developers didn&rsquo;t launch projects at all. We saw Oberoi Realty and others launch projects. The ones who held back launches did so because of other problems like oversupply in the market, slowdown in sales or their own cash flow issues.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">It&rsquo;s been a little over a year since Bansal came on board post his stint at Indiabulls Real Estate, and in that period, construction has started on five projects. DB&rsquo;s latest project is Orchid Heights, a 1.5 million sq ft development in which IL&amp;FS real estate fund has a 50% stake. IL&amp;FS has invested about $200 million of its total corpus of $2 billion. &ldquo;We have invested both at the entity and the project level,&rdquo; says Mahesh Iyer, senior vice president, IL&amp;FS. Iyer mentions that the scam involving the promoters set the fund back by a year but now things are back on track. &ldquo;We are back in business and are working closely with the company to ensure timely completion,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class="p4">DB expects sales of #5,000 crore from the Orchid Heights project. Another Rs 2,000 crore is expected to be realised from soon-to-be-launched premium projects in Mumbai and Pune. &ldquo;We expect Rs 7,000 crore of revenue realisation from these projects. If we assume a Rs 2,000 crore cost of construction, that gives us at least Rs 5,000 crore of cash flow,&rdquo; says Bansal.</p>\n<p class="p8">&nbsp;<strong>Double counting</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">Essentially then, faster execution of existing projects and pushing supply through new launches are the twin pillars on which DB&rsquo;s turnaround strategy is based. Murky real estate accounting is also expected to play its part. The percentage completion method allows real estate developers to book revenue once a certain portion of the construction cost has been sunk in. The threshold for DB is 25% and the joke is that revenue can be booked even when not received. No wonder then that Bansal is gung ho about pushing execution past the 25% mark so that the topline gets a boost. He says, &ldquo;The problem is that unless you cross the threshold of 25-30% of construction cost incurred on the project, revenue does not get recognised despite sales and cash flows. We have Rs 30,000 crore of inventory. The main cost involved is construction cost, which is around 30%. The rest 70% is cash flow. Once our projects hit the revenue recognition phase, the numbers will begin to change.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Bansal maintains that DB is a &ldquo;sleeping giant&rdquo;, which after waking up will silence critics and competitors alike. &ldquo;In India&rsquo;s most expensive market, we have a 90 million sq ft land bank. Our cheapest inventory sells at Rs 10,000 per sq ft, so you can imagine what we are worth,&rdquo; he says. This confidence seems a little brazen, as investor sentiment is a variable that the company cannot control. On its part, DB can keep pushing supply into the market but there has to be buyer appetite.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Housing it is - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">Bansal apparently doesn&rsquo;t worry about dipping buyer appetite or oversupply. He is banking on Mumbai&rsquo;s supply constrained status and believes prices can only go higher. The icing on the cake is his expectation of low interest rates. Bansal is also nonchalant about the fact that in his company&rsquo;s case, the sales volume doesn&rsquo;t matter because the cost of construction is low. &ldquo;Usually, the cost of construction is 25-30% of selling price,&rdquo; mentions Bansal.&nbsp;Anwani of KC Securities points out that the cost of construction in Mumbai has gone up by 25-30% in the past two years and that DB&rsquo;s projected cost of construction looks to be on the lower side. &ldquo;In fact, almost every developer has been talking about how the increase in cost of construction is eating into their margins, so it&rsquo;s surprising that DB says cost of construction is low.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">Bansal goes so far as to say that his company has more real estate assets (number of projects) than Lodha Developers, one of the leading builders in Mumbai, and even DLF. But the reality is that DB has 37 projects, nearly equal to what Lodha has and 28 less than what DLF has. Further, Lodha has a landbank of 274 million sq ft and that of DLF is 314 mn sq ft (more than DB&rsquo;s 90 mn sq ft).</p>\n<p class="p4">The other aspect that Bansal gloats about is low leverage. &ldquo;We have low debt compared with other players, who have fewer assets. Land is already paid for, so unlike other developers, who need to sell fast to meet their land payments and other commitments, I have no such worries.&rdquo; On the surface, the debt may appear low, but even that advantage is starting to fade. In the latest quarter, long-term debt has risen to Rs 552 crore from Rs 366 crore six months ago. In fact, the company incurred an interest cost of Rs 22 crore in the first six months of FY14 compared with #18 crore for entire FY13. Receivables, too, have fallen from Rs 1,866 crore to Rs 1,504 crore, indicating slow new sales. Then there is a bunch of selective non-disclosures that have been highlighted in the limited review by auditor Haribhakti &amp; Co. It mentions, &ldquo;A subsidiary company and six step-down subsidiaries have not been considered in the consolidated financial statement, which is not in compliance with Accounting Standard 21 &ldquo;consolidated financial statement&rdquo;. The impact of this is not quantifiable.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>Castle in the air</strong></p>\n<p class="p7">While the management believes that it is on the brink of something big, the investor community seems oblivious. DB&rsquo;s FY13 consolidated profit was Rs 3.3 crore, compared with Rs 86 crore in FY12, and the picture continues to be cloudy in FY14. Analysts don&rsquo;t track the company because they say it doesn&rsquo;t interact with them. Bansal denies this and adds that he hasn&rsquo;t been holding calls with analysts because he is waiting for things to improve. &ldquo;I will talk to investors when I have something to highlight. Right now, we are trying to get things back on track.&rdquo; A senior official with a private equity firm says the company&rsquo;s lack of transparency has always been a problem. &ldquo;When Godrej Properties holds investor calls, it is not just for analysts but also for investors, who have put money into the company. Such transparency always helps,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p4">KC Securities&rsquo; Anwani, is one of the few who used to track the company. &ldquo;We have limited access to the company, so we have suspended coverage.&rdquo; According to Anwani, the company needs to focus on execution to make up for delays in the past. &ldquo;We feel they have not done enough to speed up construction. Sales volume needs to pick up so that their cash flows improve.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">Being a relative newcomer, DB Realty doesn&rsquo;t have much of an execution track record. The company has so far completed only a few residential projects that were much smaller in cost and complexity. The scrutiny that the company&rsquo;s projects came under after the 2G scam halted its meteoric rise and also led to a delay in projects. Even Orchid Woods, which was launched in February 2007, was to be completed by June 2011. In its defence, the company says the project is in the final stages of completion. Another project, Ozone, which was to be delivered by September 2012, has been delayed as well.</p>\n<p class="p4">Here, too, while ground reality suggests otherwise, the company insists that about 350,000 sq ft has been constructed and the project is close to completion. Bansal is adamant that on-time completion of projects has taken precedence for the company since revenue recognition is contingent on speedy completion of projects. &ldquo;We ensure that our execution is on track by hiring the best names in the industry. We have a tie-up with L&amp;T&rsquo;s construction arm, IL&amp;FS Engineering, and several architect firms to make sure that our projects are delivered on time,&rdquo; he blusters.</p>\n<p class="p4">The reality is that like all other developers, DB too is asset-rich and cash flow starved. Not only have DB&rsquo;s promoters pledged more than 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of their 61% stake, the auditor notes, &ldquo;Guarantees issued and securities provided to banks and financial institutions on behalf of various entities aggregate Rs 3,040 crore which are significant in relation to the net-worth of the company.&rdquo; This cash-starved state has also pushed the management to focus only on residential construction and hence its earlier focus on commercial and hotel projects has been considerably diluted. Even its Ascot Centre residential project was earlier intended to be a commercial development and the Residence was planned as a hotel. While it has retained two hotels, one in Mumbai and another in Goa, the company has decided not to take up any new hospitality projects. &ldquo;We will retain our existing projects and those in the pipeline will either undergo change of use to residential or will get divested,&rdquo; says Bansal.</p>\n<p class="p4">Like most real estate companies, DB has its share of litigation and apart from the ongoing 2G spectrum case, the biggest cloud is weak demand. Ramesh Nair, COO, Jones Lang LaSalle India, says, &ldquo;Being a regional player, DB&rsquo;s future is dependent on how the Mumbai market will perform. Everything will depend on DB&rsquo;s ability to execute after getting approvals.&rdquo; In a worst-case scenario, the management might be forced to sell their land holdings in a piecemeal fashion or lenders might end up taking possession in case of a debt default. With projects in prime locations, DB&rsquo;s land parcels should be a magnet for cash-rich suitors. Bansal, though, has no such worries. He is more preoccupied thinking about the cash flow windfall that he is expecting. Brimming with confidence that the next few years will be DB&rsquo;s best, he says, &ldquo;Even as we speak, we have Rs 300 crore of free cash flow. Our biggest worry now is how to utilise our free cash flows.&rdquo; It is a pleasant worry, one that his competitors will be happy to have.&nbsp;</p>', 'The DB Realty management is focusing on project execution to make a comeback.

According to McDonald&rsquo;s India VP Amit Jatia, the firm plans to open around 75-100 new stores by FY15 with an investment of about Rs 500 crore to add to its tally of 174 stores. Jubilant plans to add 135 Dominos outlets and 18-20 Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts ones to its current network of 650 Dominos and 19 Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts stores.

So, how did he end up buying into a tech firm whose IPO had devolved a couple of years earlier, in February 1993? &ldquo;I first read about Infosys in a magazine. I was impressed by the quality and transparency of its management. I acted somewhat impetuously I felt, in converting many other holdings to Infosys in 1996-97, even while booking a loss in some names,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Luckily, it turned out okay.&rdquo; Manseta&rsquo;s loyalty continues to pay off, with the stock having bounced back after the Q1FY14 numbers were announced. This &lsquo;buy and hold&rsquo; approach has served him well as he has gone about allocating surplus cash from the family&rsquo;s copper wire manufacturing and leather exports business. While Infosys is an important holding, the portfolio that he manages for his family members today has a diverse mix of stocks accumulated over the past nearly two decades. &ldquo;While FMCG has traditionally been a value investor&rsquo;s hunting ground, Manseta had the discipline to hold onto HUL, Nestle and Marico for a long time. He also bought Shriram Transport Finance and Godrej Consumer when a lot of investors were skeptical about their ability to deliver,&rdquo; says Karthikeyan Muthuswamy of Trident Capital Advisors, an investment advisor to Elliott Management.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Earn and learn</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">When Manseta returned to Mumbai after completing his MBA degree at Dartmouth, the avenues available to him placed him at a crossroads. He had the option of continuing with the family business, opt to work for somebody else or become a full-time investor. Given that he had dabbled in investing before his MBA, Manseta chose to continue with it. Justifying his choice, Manseta says, &ldquo;I like understanding what makes businesses tick &mdash; why one succeeds and another fails &mdash; and what the business can be worth.&rdquo; Manseta started off with stocks such as Colgate, Castrol and Hindustan Lever, but during his college days he had never imagined that he would end up as an investor. His MBA degree was in general management and even today he considers himself more of a business analyst than a stock market investor. &ldquo;I never took finance theory seriously. I always saw it as some sort of a math problem to be solved! Looking back, I got through those classes without the efficient markets theory or CAPM actually entering my brain,&rdquo; he quips.</p>\n<p class="p4">Although he is a veteran investor now, his first stock recommendation &mdash; McLeod Russell &mdash; came from a college friend at Sydenham. He remembers asking his father if they could buy the stock, then trading at Rs 110.&nbsp; His father, in turn, asked a friend, who advised him to stick to blue chips. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t buy and within a few days it went to Rs 160. I bought it at that level, and sold it a few years later at a profit.&rdquo; Clearly, the investing advice his father received from his friend was hardly a deterrent as Manseta went about adding stocks to his portfolio. Even today, for identifying or shortlisting stocks, he does not use a screen and most of his ideas are driven by common sense, a basic DuPont analysis or his interaction with fellow investors. &ldquo;I have run screens occasionally years ago, but that is not a method I prefer. When you possess curiosity and also have some friends interested in the markets, you hear and read about some good names over time. That&rsquo;s the starting point. It is then a matter of reading the annual reports and working to understand the business itself. Over time, you come to appreciate some good businesses and companies out there and you constantly seek new ones.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">One such good company was Gruh Finance, which he bought when it was quoting at Rs 45 (pre-split). Manseta recalls being in Ahmedabad for his cousin&rsquo;s wedding in 2005. &ldquo;Being my frugal self, I decided to meet the Gruh management during the same trip,&rdquo; he confesses. Since the finance executive with whom he had an appointment couldn&rsquo;t make it for the meeting, managing director Sudhin Choksey himself ran Manseta through the business. &ldquo;During the one-hour meeting, he&nbsp; explained how Gruh reached out to under-served customers. When I left, I felt strongly that you couldn&rsquo;t go wrong partnering with such a company.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">That said, Karthikeyan had zeroed in on Gruh much earlier. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t discuss it while buying but Gruh Finance turned out to be a common investment. I picked it up at around Rs 20 (pre-split) in 2002 and Megh bought it about a couple of years later.&rdquo; Explaining his decision to buy Gruh, Manseta says, &ldquo;I liked its sheer focus on its core segment. Over the years, I had seen Gruh&rsquo;s competitors come in, slash rates down to irrational levels, grab market share, poach employees, everything. But over time, they built up high NPAs and exited the market, while Gruh went on.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Like Karthikeyan, veteran value investor Chetan Parikh, too, believes Manseta was early and patient enough to hold on to Gruh. Parikh first met Manseta and his father at Bombay Gymkhana when the former was trying to decide what to do with his career after returning to India in end-2003. &ldquo;He saw inflection points in Gruh that others may not have caught on to. Having reached a certain scale, its cost to income ratio was declining and that led to a rise in net interest margin as well as RoE.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Given their long association and Parikh&rsquo;s long standing reputation as a true-blue value investor, has Manseta borrowed a page or two from Parikh&rsquo;s stylesheet? &ldquo;We talk about value investing principles and don&rsquo;t really exchange notes on individual stocks before we buy them, but we did happen to have a common investment in Bosch some time ago,&rdquo; adds Parikh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Bosch is an investment whose success Manseta prefers to proudly showcase. During his brief tenure at Eaton doing M&amp;A, he worked on a deal with Bosch&rsquo;s parent (they were selling a small subsidiary in Japan). Despite being miles ahead technologically, they were open and fair in their dealings. That piqued Manseta&rsquo;s interest; he found out more and invested. &ldquo;Mico (now Bosch) has never been the cheapest company in my portfolio, yet it has compounded at nearly 30% for nine years from when we bought it in October 2003 to end-2012. It is a great lesson that high quality pays well even though you may not have entered at a very cheap price,&rdquo; he reveals.</p>\n<p class="p4">Then there was Hawkins Cookers, which always had high brand recall but not much market fancy. No less than a legend like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala had sold the stock after experiencing fatigue due to its moribund momentum. It seemed like its time was yet to come and come it did once the market bottomed out post the AIG bailout in March 2009. Manseta bought the stock September 2008 onwards at an average price of around #160. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t followed Hawkins much at all. I remember coming across their quarterly results in a newspaper. I looked up the past ten years&rsquo; annual reports, liked what I read and began buying right away,&rdquo; says Manseta. He, however, regrets not buying enough of Hawkins. He says his attention was consumed buying Mangalam, a mid-cap cement company, and Voltamp, which makes transformers. &ldquo;Hawkins looked the most expensive of the three. Mangalam went up much faster, but later gave back 2/3rd of its gains, and the transformer company also eventually retraced its path. The lesson was that it is not enough to buy what looks mathematically cheap. You have to think about cash flows, sustainability and cyclicality.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Karthikeyan, who has known Manseta for more than a decade, says, &ldquo;Buying Voltamp Transformers was unlike Manseta, but he made money there. His focus has always been on a few sectors that he understands and that is why Voltamp was the odd digression.&rdquo; About his tryst with Voltamp, Manseta says, &ldquo;Some decisions, you just don&rsquo;t know what you were thinking. It seemed a growth company at the time. I misjudged the degree of cyclicality in that particular business.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Well learnt&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">A few lessons had also sunk in earlier in 2006 and 2007, when Manseta was trying hard to keep pace with a rising market. That is when he says his portfolio diversification grew and he made some of his worst investment calls. Prominent among them was buying into a transmission company called Jyoti Structures. Manseta admits to getting mesmerised by the Chinese math about how India will need transmission towers because of regional imbalances and power shortages etc. He explains, &ldquo;It looked like low PE at the time and even lower PE on a projected basis. It was a momentum purchase, and I convinced myself that this was still going to grow. A cursory glance at the past ten years&rsquo; cash flow, not just sales and profits, would have told me a lot about how this sad story would play out.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">Another mistake was a commodity firm with high related-party transactions, which doubled after Manseta bought it. It then dawned on him that he had not averaged historical earnings nor examined their chequered past. &ldquo;I met their CFO and asked, &lsquo;Do you hedge your&nbsp; dollar and shipping costs?&rsquo;. He answered &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to both and explained the process in some detail. They reported huge losses in FY09, blaming the dollar and shipping costs! And the CFO had left!&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">As mentioned earlier, buying and waiting has paid off for Manseta in a lot of stocks. But there was one where his impatience led to him leaving sizeable money on the table. He bought GSK Consumer at around Rs 245 in 2004. It was cash-rich but reluctant to return much cash to shareholders. So, he exited in FY10 around Rs 1,500. Soon after, a new managing director launched product extensions, paid out a special dividend and the parent announced a buyback at Rs 3,900. &ldquo;At Rs 2,500, I saw the changes and their impact, but I dithered about getting back in. The stock is north of Rs 4,000 today. The company had healthy operating margins, decent cash flow, good governance, and an enduring brand. I just got impatient because they were holding cash.&rdquo; To make amends, Manseta did buy into GSK during its recent fall from its high of Rs 6,000 to about Rs 3,800 and intends to buy more if it goes lower.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Guide map</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">While investing is about staying focused on what one does best, Karthikeyan says there are three broad types of investors in the market: the relative performer, that is, the long-only mutual fund. The second type are the absolute return investors, such as traders and hedge funds. The third type are HNIs such as Manseta, who can cash in on the volatility caused by FII buying and selling. Manseta, who has always been on the lookout for companies with a strong competitive positioning, agrees, &ldquo;FII selling can drive prices down in a hurry at times of macro uncertainty, be it in India or globally. If the price is already high, a good surprise may not do much for a stock, while a negative surprise may de-rate it completely. Your patience is rewarded when you get the chance to buy stocks after a sharp correction.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Now, with nearly two decades of investing experience, Manseta believes, &ldquo;If you force yourself to own only 20 names, you will be much more careful and thorough about each. This is a matter of temperament and discipline, not simply business judgment.&rdquo; That thought comes from Warren Buffett, an investing legend whom Manseta hugely admires. During his MBA days at Dartmouth, Manseta worked on a report on Buffett&rsquo;s investment approach. &ldquo;I sent him a copy of the report and offered to work for him for free. He wrote back a kind and encouraging letter. I called my dad in India, reading out my letter and Buffett&rsquo;s reply. He was very happy for me,&rdquo; reveals Manseta, who also makes it a point to regularly attend the Berkshire annual meeting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Of Manseta&rsquo;s visits to the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, Parikh says, &ldquo;He is probably one of the few value investors who goes to Berkshire&rsquo;s annual meeting on a regular basis and may have even beaten Raamdeo Agrawal (of Motilal Oswal) in the number of times that he may have gone to Berkshire.&rdquo; Manseta explains his regular presence there thus: &ldquo;Berkshire is a way of life, a mindset that combines integrity, unrelenting hard work, humility and wisdom. I have met some very nice people at Omaha and a few have even become friends. Someone emailed me a copy of the early Partnership Letters in 2004, which I think are worth careful and repeated study. It makes a world of a difference being there, rather than simply reading the transcript a few days later in a different part of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Of all the times that he has been to Omaha, his most favorite moments have to do with interacting with Buffett. Earlier, Buffett would meet international shareholders individually, sign an autograph, and chat briefly in the international meeting, held right after the annual meeting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Manseta reminisces, &ldquo;I always used to say, &lsquo;How are you sir, it&rsquo;s great to see you again and I&rsquo;m really happy to be here&rsquo;. And I always got a broad smile, a few words and a very firm handshake! The 2006 meeting stands out because, &ldquo;Bill Gates was sitting next to Warren and Charlie and I asked him, &lsquo;When are you bringing Mr. Buffett to India?&rsquo; He smiled and said, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re working on that one&rsquo;. And then Warren piped in, &lsquo;Find me another Ajit Jain and I&rsquo;ll come there to hire him!&rsquo; While most of Manseta&rsquo;s Berkshire memories are happy ones, the 2010 one has a tinge of sadness to it. &ldquo;I travelled to Omaha in 2010, got the news about my dad passing away a few hours later and turned back the next morning. I will always regret not insisting that he come along at least once during my earlier visits.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">Like in Warren&rsquo;s case, Manseta&rsquo;s father was a big influence on him and it was to be with his family that Manseta had returned to India. &ldquo;My father fully supported my love for investing. I remember in January 2005, I computed our family returns, compared them to the indices and left them on dad&rsquo;s table. The next day, he hugged me and said, &lsquo;Megh, that&rsquo;s fantastic, you have found yourself, now just stay in this field&rsquo;.&rdquo; That, undoubtedly, was the best advice that Megh Manseta ever received and he&rsquo;s done well to heed it. &nbsp;</p>', 'Despite the double-digit compounding of his portfolio over the past decade, Megh Manseta prefers to attribute the outperformance to favourable tailwinds than to his own stock picking ', '2', '', 0, '', 'the-reticent-investor-442', 436, 1, 0, 0, 13, 'The reticent investor ', 'Despite the double-digit compounding of his portfolio over the past decade, Megh Manseta prefers to attribute the outperformance to favourable tailwinds than to his own stock picking ', '', '', '', 'Megh Manseta', 0, NULL, '2015-02-06 13:11:56', '2015-03-02 14:44:34', '2013-12-21', 0),

(444, 24, '', 'On the write path', '<p class="p1">The walls of former techie Amrita Chowdhury&rsquo;s Mumbai apartment are practically papered with tomes on psychology, economics, romance, crime and more. As the India head of publishing firm Harlequin &mdash; known for churning out bodice-rippers such as the Mills &amp; Boon series &mdash; books come with the territory for Chowdhury. And the ones on display are just the tip of the iceberg: &ldquo;There are more closets filled with books. I think there are more than a 1,000 books in here,&rdquo; she says, looking around the house. Chowdhury, who assumed her current role at Harlequin this January, traces her interest in books to her childhood. &ldquo;First as a reader, then as a writer and now as a publisher, I have always been associated with books,&rdquo; she says.</p>\n<p class="p4">Chowdhury says her mother encouraged her to learn more about the world around through books. Born in Patna and an IIT Kanpur alumnus, Chowdhury completed her MS from UC Berkeley and worked as an engineer in Silicon Valley in 1990s. During her time at Berkeley, she attended several journalism courses, culminating in a two-month internship with <em>National Geographic Traveller</em>. Chowdhury went on to finish her MBA from Tepper Business School and worked in the US and Australia for several years, but the writing bug had dug deep. &ldquo;When I moved back to India in 2007, I decided to write a book. I took a two-year break from professional life then.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p4">In 2009, Chowdhury&rsquo;s first novel <em>Faking It</em>, a contemporary fiction on art forgery, was published. &ldquo;At that time, the art market in India was exploding. There were many reports of famous paintings being forged,&rdquo; she says. But this wasn&rsquo;t the only reason why she based her book on the subject. &ldquo;I have a soft corner for art. When I was in IIT, we had to opt for a humanities subject every semester. I realised then that I enjoy art history.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Fortunately, for Chowdhury, her personal and professional interests seem to have dovetailed neatly. Chowdhury was heading Harvard Business School&rsquo;s executive education portfolio in India when Harlequin approached her for her current assignment. &ldquo;I knew I was not the obvious choice for this role, but I didn&rsquo;t think twice about taking it up. Now I can read both at home and at work,&rdquo; she smiles. It isn&rsquo;t as easy as it sounds, though, admits Chowdhury. &ldquo;The choice of books is different now. I can&rsquo;t just pick up any book and start reading; I have to proceed according to work demands.&rdquo; She counts several Indian authors among her favourites and says she is amazed at how author Amish has blended mythology with science in his Shiva Trilogy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Like many book lovers, Chowdhury stays away from eBooks and believes that the print industry will see a boom soon.

Rooms and suites with swimming pools and well-stocked libraries in the en suite studies, pantries large enough to cater for parties, infinity pools with jacuzzis at the edge of the scarp, massage chairs by the bed, spa treatments on call: in luxury hotels, every decadent pleasure is usually anticipated and provided for, but rarely has space been used with as much joy and playfulness as in the Cinema Suite at the Taj Hotel at 51 Buckingham Gate, London.</p>\n<p class="p3">Designed by Sabyasachi, the couturist whose clothes are eponymous with Indian <em>shaadis</em>, it is an explosion of colour and sensibility and an assault on your senses, so much so that you may need a moment or two to catch your breath before you proceed further. Completed last year, the suite&rsquo;s genesis was in a simple request the hotel&rsquo;s general manager made to the designer while the latter was staying there. Would Sabyasachi consider designing some cushions, a tablecloth, perhaps a bedcover for the suite? &ldquo;I said I wanted to have a look at the suite,&rdquo; Sabyasachi recounts of the commission. He did, and then asked for the impossible: a restructuring of the bathroom, the plumbing and so on, despite the &pound;7,500 renovation the hotel had just undertaken.</p>\n<p class="p3">The overall brief was to have a suite sensibility aligned to Indian &mdash; not just Bollywood &mdash; cinema. As he began to take charge, Sabyasachi slowly &ldquo;arm-twisted&rdquo; the general manager into agreeing to more changes &mdash; the floors, walls, baths, even changing the size of the rooms &mdash; to develop his own version of &ldquo;beautiful clutter&rdquo;. To his clients that should come as no surprise since his stores, too, are echoes of that sensibility: &ldquo;the home of a well-travelled person&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;It reflects,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;my personality in many ways.

And thus was born redBus.in.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Linking The Twain</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">Travel operators love the holiday season, which runs from October to January and May to July. Reports suggest that close to half a billion Indians holiday every year. But despite the heavy volume, some buses fail to achieve even a 50% seat load. Sama explains that most of these bus operators cannot reach their customers: &ldquo;Not one of them is organised.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Operators still hold on to the archaic system of depending on walk-ins or fix-ups through agents. There was a bridge missing between bus operators and consumers and that was what Sama wanted to build. Sama roped in two of his friends&mdash;Charan Padmaraju and Sudhakar Pasupunuri&mdash;to help him develop the solution he had in mind.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">&ldquo;Initially, it was meant to be an open source solution,&rdquo; he recalls, &ldquo;We wanted to create a platform and let someone else develop it.&rdquo; It was a safe bet. It would require no investment and since none of the three had first-hand knowledge of web designing, they would learn a new skill.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Pilani Soft Labs - graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The interface was simply meant to be the intermediary between travel agents, operators and customers, without incurring any costs. The plan was to access operators&rsquo; systems and present them to customers, who could pick and choose tickets from various options. But that didn&rsquo;t work out. &ldquo;None of the operators wanted to work with us,&rdquo; says Sama. They refused access to their systems and the idea was in danger of being stillborn.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">It was then that Sama read an advertisement by TiE, a non-profit that helps entrepreneurs realise their dreams. TiE&rsquo;s Bangalore chapter was inviting start-ups to participate in a workshop and seek mentors to help monetise their ideas. Sama came out of the workshop with a mentor and a business plan. In partnership with his friends, he set up Pilani Soft Labs as a tribute to his school&mdash;BITS. The initial investment: #5 lakh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Tinkering Under The Hood</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">&ldquo;We were doing it all wrong,&rdquo; explains Sama. His mentor asked him to &ldquo;first sell seats on a bus just like regular travel agents&rdquo; and establish credibility. Only then would the money start to flow. The company bought a few seats on popular routes and put them up on the website. &ldquo;We bought two seats on a bus. Customers saw those seats and assumed the rest were sold out and bought the seat,&rdquo; explains Sama.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">redBus provides a number of options for each route, allowing customers to sort buses according to type (sleeper, seater, AC or non-AC), timings and cost. If seats are available, customers can choose between window or aisle options and then pay to book the seat. redBus retains a commission for its trouble.</p>\n<p class="p2">The model is not new. Other Online Travel Agents (OTA) do exactly the same thing in the airline business. So consumers were familiar with the process. The business grew and redBus now has ties with 850 bus operators, including Goa&rsquo;s state-run Kadamba Transport Corporation. The portal employs 500 people and runs six call centres across the country.</p>\n<p class="p2">After the success of redBus, its business-to-consumer model, Pilani Soft Labs developed two more products: Bus Operators Software System (Boss) and SeatSeller. Boss connected Pilani&rsquo;s network with bus operators&rsquo; systems. This allowed the latter to access valuable information such as consumer traffic on routes and consumer profiles, using tools similar to Google Analytics. &ldquo;The system can help bus operators see which routes are popular and which ones aren&rsquo;t. They can then direct inventory toward preferred routes,&rdquo; Sama explains. Boss is sold to the bus contractors for a monthly subscription, and brings in around Rs 50-60 lakh a month.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">SeatSeller is a tool that links travel agents to Soft Labs&rsquo; network, helping them choose between an array of buses, routes and timings. Together, these business-to-business models account for 30% of Pilani Soft Labs&rsquo; revenues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">redBus still accounts for the lion&rsquo;s share of the top line though. In the last five years, the ticketing site has grown to become one of the biggest e-commerce websites in the country. It has attracted venture capital from Seed Fund and Inventus capital. Seed Fund got in on the ground and has no plans for an exit yet while Inventus is reported to have invested $2 million in 2009. Recently, Pilani Soft Labs also raised $6.5 million through series C funding from Helion Ventures.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Turning The Corner</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">Today, redBus is almost a monopoly in the bus-travel market. Out of 2 million unique visitors that log on to the site every month, sources say the conversion rate is closer to 20%&mdash;almost 10 times Makemytrip&rsquo;s conversion. And it&rsquo;s getting more popular by the day. Internet traffic stats site Alexa reports that the ticketing site has seen an 11% increase in page views in the last three months.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Several others have tried to match the Bangalore-based company but have failed. &ldquo;There were a few,&rdquo; says Ram Badrinathan, Market Analyst at PhoCusWright, &ldquo;but none could succeed. It&rsquo;s the management style and execution of redBus that makes it successful.&rdquo; Several bus ticketing portals, including Ticketvala.com and Abhibus entered the market but did not execute as effectively as redBus. Ticketvala was even acquired by MakeMyTrip but has not been able to make a dent in redBus&rsquo; popularity. &ldquo;OTAs have now started to source their tickets from redBus,&rdquo; says Mahesh Murthy, Founding Partner, Seed Fund. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Sama attributes this to his ground-up approach to marketing. &ldquo;When we started the company, I stood outside IT companies during the lunch hour to distribute pamphlets about redBus,&rdquo; he recalls. He learned what customers wanted and changed his product accordingly. Pilani Soft more than doubled its turnover last fiscal, recording sales of Rs 12.14 crore compared to Rs 5.19 crore in FY10. It&rsquo;s inching closer to the black: operating loss in FY11 was Rs 3.11 crore, down from Rs 3.61 crore the previous year. The equity capital of the company expanded to Rs 48 lakh with an infusion of Rs 35 crore last fiscal.</p>\n<p class="p2">Sama now plans to target government buses. &ldquo;IRCTC&rsquo;s revenue is close to Rs 6,000 crore and we [redBus] want to get close to that,&rdquo; says Murthy, talking about the company&rsquo;s five-year target. redBus has started services in Bangladesh as well, though that arm is yet to take off fully.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"The bus travel space is worth $2.5 billion and we have been able to access only 3% of the market.

(450, 15, '', 'As you like it', '<p class="p1">On a dark and squally weekday afternoon, as an incessant rain drums on a very old tiled roof, a stained glass arch welcomes a surprisingly steady flow of customers into a warm and well-lit expanse of shelves lined with books. Inside, the sternly attired yet benign black-and-white visages of father-son founders &lsquo;AJ&rsquo; and &lsquo;CH&rsquo; Higginbotham continue to gaze upon India&rsquo;s oldest bookstore, established 1844. The heritage building not only retains its original chequered marble floor but is still that good ol&rsquo; book shop. You know, that place we used to go to buy books before they started selling perfumes and potted plants? &ldquo;Actually, you could say we sell knowledge in any format&mdash;so we do have CDs and DVDs that support our core business of books,&rdquo; clarifies S Chandrasekhar, wholetime Director, Higginbothams, which operates out of its flagship stores in Chennai and Bangalore, 22&nbsp;fully-owned branches across small towns like Tirunelveli (a topper in sales), besides university campuses like Manipal.</p>\n<p class="p3">In 1949, the Chennai-based Amalgamations Group took over Higginbothams in what has since proved to be a benevolent ownership. The iconic chain of bookstores may not be a scintillating case study at a B-school but it has plodded along to remain a haven for, &ldquo;the books that are published and the people who want to read them,&rdquo; as Chandrasekhar explains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Not changing has become a virtue for Higginbothams,&rdquo; says Gautam Padmanabhan, CEO of Westland, wholly owned publishing subsidiary of Tata&rsquo;s Trent. &ldquo;I think they have the winning formula.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>One Hundred Years Of Solitude</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Whereas most prominent retailers have felt compelled to expand into segments like music, toys and entertainment, Higginbothams remains an almost library-like experience. It avoids long tailing, which is the retailing philosophy of selling small quantities of a large number of unique items alongside a much smaller number of popular items in bigger quantities. &ldquo;Everybody is talking about a long tail these days but if you look for the long tail in bookstores all over the world, you hardly ever find it&mdash;nobody wants to hold it, not Borders or Barnes &amp; Noble,&rdquo; says Hemu Ramaiah, founder and former CEO of the Landmark chain of bookstores. But Higginbotham&rsquo;s strategy isn&rsquo;t so about being prescient, as it is about maintaining inertia.</p>\n<p class="p3">The owners of Higginbothams have taken care to maintain their heritage premises. Another massive restoration effort is in the offing, the efforts of which will be visible in April. Geographically, too, the focus on books serves the company well within its market. Bookstores generally do well in southern India, where real estate costs are lower and the reading habit continues to have a dedicated following.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Academic publishing is the ace Higginbothams holds and takes very seriously. &ldquo;There was one IIT, one MIT (Madras Institute of Technology) and there were five engineering colleges 20 years ago,&rdquo; says Chandrasekhar. &ldquo;Today, we have more than 400 institutions teaching engineering and technology. Naturally, we have to cope with the additional demand.&rdquo; Textbooks, unlike other categories in publishing, cannot be purchased online. &ldquo;Buyers are always going to browse and, perhaps, look for a discounted older edition, and then incidentally buy a work of fiction too,&rdquo; Ramaiah points out. Higginbothams is such a store.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Modern retailers have to pay modern rents,&rdquo; says Ramaiah. &ldquo;The Higginbothams model is surviving because they are working out of old premises with old costs. Otherwise, it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible [to survive].&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Online sales and digitisation of books have skewed the pitch for brick-and-mortar retailing. &ldquo;A major problem is competition from websites like Flipkart,&rdquo; says Padmanabhan. But other than sprucing up their flagship stores with new racks, Higginbothams hasn&rsquo;t tried to keep up with sectoral trends. Perhaps that&rsquo;s part of the reason Higginbothams is hardly growing. Last year its topline grew 2.8% to Rs 51.25 crore with losses of Rs 1.33. But, thanks to &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of Rs 1.61 crore, it ended the year with marginal profits. The saving grace is that the bookstore has a clean balance sheet with no debt and cash balance of Rs 7.5 crore.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since we are part of a major group, funding has never been a problem,&rdquo; says Chandrasekhar.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>The World is Flat</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">As with nearly everything else, India is one of the few growing markets for books. Observers note that the US or UK appear to have reached saturation with industry growth rates in the region of 0.5 to 1%. &ldquo;On the other hand, although we don&rsquo;t have very scientific methods of keeping track of book sales, we still believe the market is growing at 15-20% y-o-y,&rdquo; says Padmanabhan.</p>\n<p class="p3">There are two sides to the Indian books market in which store owners struggle to adapt and remain relevant&mdash;the concentration of book retail in metropolitan India is hurting its players but, conversely, there aren&rsquo;t enough bookshops in tier 2 and 3 cities, leave alone the rural hinterland. &ldquo;We would like to expand with more small outlets outside railway stations&rdquo; says Chandrasekhar. &ldquo;Demand is very good in small towns and the local population does not expect fancy stores that cost a lot to set-up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Still standing - Image</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">At another level, wholesale book-selling is getting squeezed out as foreign publishers such as Random House and Hachette set up base in India, and older players like Penguin and Harper Collins expand their catalogues vigorously. Earlier, distributors imported directly but now stock is purchased from the <br /> India offices of foreign imprints. Both developments dried up distribution margins, which sank to 5-7% at the wholesale level. A company like Westland, which was a very active distributor not so long ago, has largely moved to a model where it only distributes what it publishes in-house. Consequently, retail margins on book sales, which used to be about 50%, have now dwindled to between 15-40%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Our margins are around 30% on average,&rdquo; says Chandrasekhar. &ldquo;When we buy books, we may take low-priced government textbooks for less than 10% discount but we do get some reference books for discounts as high as 40%. We work on a proper product mix to reach operational profitability.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Fierce competition also forces retailers to &lsquo;push&rsquo; stock on a regular basis. Higginbothams, however, has never been known to hold a sale and its inventory management is perforce conservative. &ldquo;About 85% of the books we are not able to sell cannot be returned to the publishers,&rdquo; says the soft spoken M Hemalatha, Senior Customer Relations Manager, Higginbothams. &ldquo;We have to bear the loss. So, we have to manage inventory very carefully.&rdquo; At the same time, she tries to avoid &lsquo;missed sales&rsquo;, that is, clients asking for something the store doesn&rsquo;t have.</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always been a grand place to shop for books,&rdquo; says historian S Muthiah, who has written of Higginbothams&rsquo; illustrious past in his very definitive <em>Madras <br /> Rediscovered</em>. &ldquo;They are one of the earliest &lsquo;English bookshops&rsquo; to stock Tamil books.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;For generations, we have had the identity of a dependable bookseller,&rdquo; says Chandrasekhar. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an identity we cannot afford to lose on any account.&rdquo; In that, Higginbothams competes only with itself. After all, no other Indian bookstore can claim to have been around for 167 years.&nbsp;</p>', 'Very little has changed at Higginbothams since it opened in 1844 — and that''s exactly how its customers like it', '34', '', 0, '', 'as-you-like-it-450', 444, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'As you like it ', 'Very little has changed at Higginbothams since it opened in 1844 — and that''s exactly how its customers like it', '', '', '', 'Higginbothams,Bookstores', 0, NULL, '2015-02-06 17:59:15', '2015-02-06 18:01:47', '2012-01-21', 0),
(451, 12, '', 'Green evolution', '<p class="p1">Five years ago, Anuradha S did not so much as glance at the rack marked &lsquo;health&rsquo; tucked away in the far aisle of her neighbourhood supermarket, a dusty shelf half full with a motley assortment of &lsquo;organically grown&rsquo; rice, &lsquo;diabetic <em>atta</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;diet <em>chivda</em>&rsquo; piled in an uninspiring jumble. She considered buying &lsquo;natural&rsquo; pepper once, but never found it the next few times she went. &ldquo;I always thought organic food was meant for rich people who could afford exclusive shops,&rdquo; says the 43-year-old home-maker. &ldquo;Now, there are so many brands and the prices are better. Rice, <em>atta</em> and spices, of course, and even <em>masalas, sooji</em> and dry fruits.Organic rice is only about Rs 10 more per kilo than my &lsquo;regular&rsquo; rice.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">It isn&rsquo;t only Anuradha. Not too long ago, most upper middle class families in India would have struggled to explain even what &lsquo;organic&rsquo; food was all about. Those numbers haven&rsquo;t diminished drastically, but awareness and acceptance of the benefits of chemical-free produce (no pesticides, no synthetic fertilisers) has grown enough that organic food is no longer restricted to trendy, upmarket grocery stores or a solitary shelf at the local supermarket. As demand for organic food has increased it has found itself on shelves labeled under &lsquo;natural&rsquo; and &lsquo;organic&rsquo; produce. That&rsquo;s good news for the 600,000 organic farms in India, which are finally finding a market for their products. And this demand is making organic food companies business-like in their supply chain and marketing efforts. Granted, interest from private equity investors is still to translate into headline-grabbing deals, but there&rsquo;s little doubt that organic farming is in full bloom.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>Demand pull</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Retail, whether modern trade or the unorganised corner-store variety, works on a simple creed: <em>jo dikhta hai, woh bikta hai</em>. For organic food producers, at least, this is an unwelcome truth. Uncertain that there would be enough takers for organic produce, supermarkets and large grocery stores didn&rsquo;t bother giving them front-shelf space. You couldn&rsquo;t really blame them. Organic food may be healthier but it&rsquo;s certainly not the better-looking alternative. Unpolished rice and <em>dal</em>s don&rsquo;t look as attractive as processed cousins and fruit and vegetables are non-uniform in shape and size and could well sport insect damage (no pesticides, remember?).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Being relegated to the backshelves perpetuated a vicious cycle&mdash;the lack of visibility meant there were even fewer takers for organic produce. And it didn&rsquo;t help that organically grown food was often more expensive than conventional equivalents (the economies of scale were just not there).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">In the past few years, people are more conscious of what they&rsquo;re ingesting in the name of food and for many, it seems reasonable to pay extra to ensure no unwanted chemicals make their way into grocery bags. Research firm Netscribes identifies increasing health consciousness among consumers as one of the key drivers for the organic foods in its Agriculture and Food Industry in India 2011 report. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But it&rsquo;s not only about demand pull, although that is the prime reason why the organic business is growing. The rising interest in organic cultivation has also been encouraged by affordable certification (now Rs 500 per farm per year, down from Rs 2,000-5,000 earlier), and better prices for farm produce. All of which also means lower prices for organic produce, bringing it within the reach of a wider customer base. About 4.43 million hectares is currently certified as organic, of which 1.7 million hectares is cultivated. &ldquo;Last year, there was an 18% increase in area [under certified organic cultivation] and production increased by 20% over the previous year,&rdquo; points out Dr PVSM Gouri, Advisor, National Accreditation Body, and Consultant, Agricultural and Processed Food Exports Development Authority.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Home grown</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Until recently, almost all this produce was exported&mdash;globally, organic produce is a $50 billion-plus market, with the US accounting for over half the demand. But, as domestic interest in organic foods increases, companies are turning their attention inwards. Organic India, for instance, has offices in nine countries and until five years ago, was exporting 70% of all it produced. &ldquo;Now we sell only 30% overseas,&rdquo; says Amit Kapur, Group Product Manager, Organic India. &ldquo;The Indian market has grown so much that we want to expand here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Retailers agree. &ldquo;Organic produce is a differentatiator for Sec A clients. Sales of the organic category in our stores have grown 300% in the past three years,&rdquo; declares Mohit Kampani, Chief, Merchandising and Operations, Spencer&rsquo;s Retail. To be honest, that&rsquo;s not saying much. Organic foods are still only a tiny fraction of overall food and beverages sales. No official numbers exist but estimates place it at a minuscule Rs 200 crore, organised and otherwise. But worldwide, over the past several years, there&rsquo;s been a 4-5% consumer conversion to organic foods&mdash;in the US alone, sales of organic food and beverages have grown from $1 billion in 1990 to $26.7 billion in 2010, which is about 4% of overall F&amp;B sales. Branded organic staple companies are counting on a similar conversion in India as well. If that happens even over the next couple of decades, it should translate into a Rs 20,000-30,000 crore market. &ldquo;As we better manage our harvest cycles and consumers become more aware, the market is going to be huge,&rdquo; says N Balasubramanian, CEO of the Hyderabad-based Sresta Natural Bioproducts, which sells organic staples under the 24 Letter Mantra label.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"As we better manage harvest cycles and consumers become more aware, the market will get huge" - N Balasubramanian, CEO, 24 Letter Mantra&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Perhaps it&rsquo;s the lack of scale that is deterring PE investors from acting upon their declared interest in this new business. Also, quality is paramount in organics with even a slight contamination resulting in the entire lot being dumped. Procuring multiple SKUs from multiple states, processing them and maintaining organic fidelity is very hard. Hence, there aren&rsquo;t too many large companies where PEs can invest. &ldquo;The strong challenges faced by this market have led to minimal investments,&rdquo; concurs Gaurav Kumar, Manager, Netscribes. &ldquo;But it has strong prospects and is expected to see a growth in investments soon.&rdquo; So far, there have been only two PE investments in organic brands: $15 million in Sresta by Peepul Capital in December 2011 (an earlier round by VenturEast Fund Advisors fetched only $1.4 million) and the March 2008 investment of $20 million by Nexus India Capital in Mumbai-based Suminter India Organics. &ldquo;This is a tough space in which to execute and scale the business,&rdquo; says Sandeep Singhal, Managing Director, Nexus. &ldquo;You need an entrepreneur and founding team that is equally comfortable dealing with global companies like M&amp;S and McCormicks as with farmers in Gujarat and Karnataka.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Breaking it down</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Organic produce is not easy business. It starts with the certification&mdash;a farm can be certified organic only after three years of zero-chemical cultivation and a product only if it stays chemical-free through the supply chain till it reaches its consumer. If there is a time-lag and produce is improperly stored (with chemical fumigation or insect repellants, for instance), it loses its organic integrity. There&rsquo;s also the lack of adequate storage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">At present, the entire crop has to be procured, processed and stored by the farmer or the organic company&mdash;there is no state support. &ldquo;We would like the government to maintain organic stocks as they do for wheat and rice,&rdquo; says Raman Prabhakar, Director, Brahm Arpan Organic, maker of the Health Fields brand of organic staples.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>A healthy business- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Higher risks and lower yields make companies wary of investing in resource hungry marketing campaigns that could otherwise help them increase sales. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to advertise yet,&rdquo; concedes Varun Gupta, Founder and CEO of Bangalore-based ProNature Organic Foods. Instead, organic brands are banking on word-of-mouth publicity and attractive packaging to draw consumers. They&rsquo;re also turning to social media. Others like Fabindia use their retail network to promote organic produce. It&rsquo;s working&mdash;from 70 products when it started stocking organic produce in 2004, Fabindia now has a portfolio of over 350.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>To Market, To Market&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">As the market develops, supply chain dynamics have improved. Morarka Organic Foods&rsquo; Down To Earth has an IT-enabled platform to track 250,000 farmers in 19 states; procurement is channelised through 70,000 farmers at any given time. 24 Letter Mantra, which has grown at a compounded annual rate of 60% in the last three years, is also focused on the entire value chain, from contract farming to&nbsp; retail. The company works and promotes 10,000 small and marginal farmers across&nbsp; 40,000&nbsp; acres&nbsp; of land in 14 states.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Economies of scale have also played their part in the growth of the organic produce market. &ldquo;Twenty years ago, we used to hire one mule to haul 20 kg of produce up to the roadhead,&rdquo; says Dr Vandana Shiva, Founder of Navdanya. &ldquo;Per unit cost was naturally very high.&rdquo; Now, &ldquo;As the number of organic farmers goes up, they will be able to aggregate and bring their produce to a trading point,&rdquo; says Mukesh Gupta, Director, Operations, Morarka. While most brands belong to traders in organic produce, &ldquo;Navdanya is the only organic brand that is farmer-owned,&rdquo; says Shiva.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"As the number of organic farmers goes up, they will be able to aggregate their produce to a trading point" - Mukesh Gupta, director, operations, Morarka</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Apart from doing away with chemical fertilisers and pesticides, a major head of expense and reason for farm debt, organic farmers have been returning to traditional practices like crop rotation, cow-dung manure and neem-ginger pesticides. &ldquo;I have learned that once we farm our land the organic way, we don&rsquo;t need to add anything at all,&rdquo; says D Muthuraj, Farm Manager, NanNilam Organic Farms, Kancheepuram District. &ldquo;On the contrary, if we interfere with additives, yield falls.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s almost how the business has also grown&mdash;on its own, without outside interference.&nbsp;</p>', 'The market for organic produce is expanding as more consumers, more brands and better prices hit the shelves everywhere', '34', '', 0, '', 'green-evolution-451', 445, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Green evolution', 'The market for organic produce is expanding as more consumers, more brands and better prices hit the shelves everywhere', '', '', '', 'Organic food,Natural produce,Organic farming', 0, NULL, '2015-02-06 18:02:59', '2015-02-06 18:16:44', '2012-01-21', 0),
(452, 16, '', 'New wine, new bottle', '<p class="p1">Star One is dead, but Life&rsquo;s OK. Star India gave its seven-year-old general entertainment channel Star One a quiet burial last fortnight and brought in its replacement in a high-decibel campaign. &ldquo;Instead of trying to revive Star One, we experimented with another mass channel and created competition for Star Plus,&rdquo; says Star India CEO Uday Shankar.</p>\n<p class="p3">Star India is at pains to show that Life OK is not a resurrected Star One, even if it dons the mantle of flanking channel to the flagship Star Plus. For starters, it doesn&rsquo;t bear the Star tag. Then, it will have seven days of serials, rather than just on weekdays. Life OK also has a &lsquo;brand philosopher&rsquo; in Madhuri Dixit. And, perhaps most significantly, the channel will have three shows in an hour, rather than two, giving it shorter ad breaks.</p>\n<p class="p3">All of which should please viewers. But is it enough to increase the channel&rsquo;s viewership ratings and garner more advertising in the highly fragmented general entertainment channels segment? Star is non-committal on how content will be differentiated in this channel compared with Star Plus. But experts know the strategy. &ldquo;Star India is trying to get more mass appeal by penetrating into tier one and tier two towns. These markets also consume Star Plus, so doing away with the Star branding may help the channel create a new identity of its own,&rdquo; says Atul Phadnis, CEO of TV guidance channel, What&rsquo;s On India.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Life OK- Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">And since shorter commercial breaks mean fewer slots for advertisers, it will be a challenge for Life OK to better its ad revenues. A 10-second ad on Star Plus costs Rs 2-2.5 lakh, while one on Star One toward the end earned just Rs 4,000-5,000. There&rsquo;s no rate card for the new channel and Star is selling inventory only for its reality show, <em>Sach ka Saamna</em>, at Rs 1.2 lakh for a prime time 10-second spot. &ldquo;Star&rsquo;s strategy is to first garner ratings so that it has greater bargaining power with advertisers,&rdquo; says Punitha Arumugham, CEO, Madison Media. The initial ratings of Life OK have been respectable (87).</p>\n<p class="p3">Creating a flanking channel makes sense since it helps increase market share for the company. But in reality most broadcasters have failed in leveraging their secondary channels.

The message is repeated once more when the meter is turned off. That is Pernod Ricard, the alcoholic beverage company, welcoming you into the world of cab advertising. It&rsquo;s a mode of advertising that gives brands the opportunity to target a captive audience. And radio taxi companies such as Meru Cabs and Easy Cabs are making the most of it. It&rsquo;s all very innovative, as the brand managers of chocolate maker Mars will testify. If you&rsquo;re in a Meru cab in Mumbai, don&rsquo;t be surprised when you hear a voice message saying&nbsp; &lsquo;Hunger driving you nuts? Grab a Snickers...!&rsquo; &ldquo;Cabvertising&rdquo; allows brands to target an affluent captive audience at relatively economical rates. It includes advertising within the vehicle, through voiceovers and LCD screens, and outside, on the body of the vehicle. Some brands use cab companies to hand out samples to passengers. The cab companies track the reach of the ad, in terms of number of times the voice-over is played, or the number of samples given, and are paid on that basis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Meru Cabs began cabvertising right from its launch in 2008. It has partnered with 40-50 brands, including Snickers, Digene, Nature Valley and Godrej. It has a fleet of 5,000 cabs and ferries a million passengers in a month. Rival, Easy Cabs, got into the game one and a half years ago, and has about 50 brands advertising on its 2,500 cabs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Advertising revenues are still a small percentage for both companies, accounting for 5% of total revenue for Meru, and a negligible share for Easy Cabs. But, since the additional cost is very low, these revenues go straight to the bottom-line, making it a lucrative proposition.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Cab - Element</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;With passengers spending up to 45 minutes in the cab, there is a fair amount of play that the advertiser can have with the target segment,&rdquo; says Gavin D&rsquo;abreo, Executive Vice President (Operations), Sales &amp; Marketing, Meru Cabs. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">For a brand such as Nature Valley, which makes granola bars, this was the perfect outdoor medium. &ldquo;Our biggest challenge was to get people to try the product because the category was non-existent in India,&rdquo; says Manas Barpanda, Brand Manager, Nature Valley. Using Meru cabs&rsquo; counter in the airport to distribute samples, the company tapped into its target audience: corporate travellers and people-on-the-go.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Easy Cabs installed LCD screens 3-4 months ago (only in Mumbai). Clients such as <em>The Economist</em> advertise through the LCD screens, which are fitted into the head-rest of the front seats, much like in an aircraft. Passengers can choose to watch news or Bollywood gossip. Over a 45-minute period around 3-4 ads flash on the screen. &ldquo;It is non-intrusive and the customer can switch it off if they are not interested,&rdquo; explains Manish <br /> Trehan, COO, Easy Cabs.</p>\n<p class="p3">As this medium is cheaper than traditional media and the audience largely comprises affluent people, it makes a compelling case for brand managers to harness it. Meru charges about Rs 6,000 per month per cab for advertising on 100 cars (internally and externally). It charges up to #10,000 for sampling (this includes ads in and on the car). Rates vary with each city, with Mumbai being about 25% more expensive than Hyderabad, where it costs the least.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;The cost of advertising on cabs is a small fraction when compared to traditional media [on a per ad basis]. Considering the cost crunch, this is the best-available medium,&rdquo; says Trehan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">However, Barpanda believes cabvertising alone isn&rsquo;t enough. Nature Valley spent about 15-20% of its total advertising budget on this medium, but the granola bar maker, like others, still relies on traditional media. Kinjal Medh, COO of ad agency Draftfcb Ulka, agrees. &ldquo;It is more of a secondary medium; it can be important for products that need more attention or a better target profile. Also, this cannot have a direct impact on sales as the number of people you can impact is limited.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s still a new mode of advertising in India and cab companies are yet to find its boundaries. <br /> Innovation is the norm. Meru, for instance, is looking to introduce location-based ads, wherein as the cab passes a particular store, the GPS system triggers an ad, inviting the passenger to visit the store. It&rsquo;s all happening in there.&nbsp;</p>', 'Radio taxis are increasingly becoming popular as a vehicle for below-the-line advertising.

(454, 16, '', 'Out of favour', '<p class="p1">Once, the sun did not set on its empire&mdash;it was the ruler over all it surveyed and well beyond. Nokia&rsquo;s writ ran across the entire mobile handset universe. Nowhere was this more obvious than in India, where the Finnish overlord dominion covered 70% of the land for well over a decade. But then, it grew complacent, not paying heed to its subject&rsquo;s needs. While it slept, its rivals and a slew of newcomers quickly began encroaching on its territory. Today, the erstwhile champion holds just a meager third of its original kingdom. The fall from grace has been great. But like every great champion it has woken up and wants to regain lost ground. But it has miles to go before it can hope to do that.</p>\n<p class="p3">Seventeen years after planting its flag in India, the world&rsquo;s largest handset maker is finding itself sandwiched between cheap low-end mobiles imported from China and high-end smartphones from Samsung, HTC and the like. And really, it has no one to blame but itself. Nokia was unforgivably late in reacting to the two biggest trends in mobile handsets in recent years&mdash;dual-SIM and touchscreens. This time, when it finally did make it to the smartphone party, Nokia was the wallflower, clinging to the Symbian operating system, even as the world made clear its preference for Android and Blackberry was being crowned the king of business phones. The result: Nokia&rsquo;s been battered at both ends.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Calling up - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Still, Nokia says it&rsquo;s not Finn-ished yet. It&rsquo;s girding up to fight battles simultaneously. Apart from revamping its tech and marketing strategies, the company has partnered with Microsoft for its Windows mobile platform. Clearly, Nokia still hopes to win the epic battle in the world&rsquo;s fastest growing telecom market and regain its lost glory. The question is: can it?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Disconnected</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Nokia&rsquo;s troubles started in 2009 when the first dual-sim handsets were launched. Consumers could now have two connections on a single device and take full advantage of the tariff war being fought by operators in the country. But Nokia dismissed the dual-sim phones as a fad; and by the time it launched its dual-sim model in August 2010, these handsets had already taken over 40% of the market. The impact on Nokia&rsquo;s marketshare was devastating&mdash;from 70% in 2007, IDC figures estimated its marketshare in December 2010 at 31.5%, with local handset vendors like Micromax and Karbonn cashing in on Nokia&rsquo;s loss. Since then, dual-sim phones have reached further into the market and are no longer a lower-end phenomenon&mdash;Samsung, for instance, plans to launch a two-sim version of its top-of-the-line Galaxy smartphone very soon. That trend is showing in marketshare figures: dual and multi-sim phones comprise over 50% of the Indian market, according to Cybermedia Research. &ldquo;These devices accounted for 55.8% of quarterly shipments (in Q3 of 2011),&rdquo; says the report.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Nokia India Manging Director, D Shivakumar admits the delay took a toll on the company. &ldquo;We did not have dual sim [handsets] at the right time. It is a failure on my part and that of the organisation. We could have been significantly ahead [of the competition] if they had been launched on time,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Nokia did not have intuitive devices available when Apple, Samsung and Motorola were offering them. Symbian devices could not compete" - Anshul Gupta, principal research analyst, Gartner</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Playing catch-up with dual-sim is only part of the problem. Globally, when users were migrating to smartphones, Nokia did not have a competitive smartphone portfolio due to its reliance on the Symbian platform. The platform did not work well with touchscreen devices, which were becoming all the rage. &ldquo;Nokia did not have intuitive devices available when Apple, Samsung and Motorola were offering them. Symbian devices could not compete with Android [the OS used by Samsung, HTC, LG and Motorola, among others] and iOS platforms,&rdquo; says Anshul Gupta, Principal Research Analyst at Gartner, the world&rsquo;s largest tech advisory firm. The handset numbers don&rsquo;t reflect changing customer preferences&mdash;yet: Nokia is still the leader. But IDC&rsquo;s Q3 numbers show that Android has overtaken Symbian for the first time to become the most popular platform in India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Aiming for a resurgence</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Now, Nokia is scrambling to get its India strategy right, at both ends of the spectrum. While it&rsquo;s launched a slew of dual-sim phones in the past six months, it&rsquo;s also upped the ante in the smartphones with the Lumia series of Windows phones. Indeed, the company is aiming for 50% marketshare in 2012 on the back of its new launches: apart from Lumia, it&rsquo;s counting on the new mid-range Asha series (priced between Rs 4,000 and Rs 8,000) to drive up sales.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">That&rsquo;s slightly higher than the popular price range in India. According to Gartner, the average selling price of a mobile device is approximately $45 (Rs 2,300), with 75% of the devices sold costing below $75 (Rs 3,900) in India. And Nokia&rsquo;s got that range covered as well, with its dual-sim range. Five new multi-sim handsets have been launched since April. Some have internet browsing facility and all are priced between #1,500 and #5,500. &ldquo;We have rapidly ramped up our dual sim portfolio,&rdquo; says Shivakumar.</p>\n<p class="p3">By the time November started, Nokia had shipped around 18 million dual-sim devices globally, a significant portion of that in India. That&rsquo;s helped it claw back some market share: from 25% in the second quarter of CY11 to 31.8% in the third quarter. &ldquo;With innovation, you can differentiate. It shows that we can compete with low-cost players,&rdquo;&nbsp;Nokia Chief Executive Stephen Elop said at a technology conference in December 2011.</p>\n<p class="p3">Nokia&rsquo;s strategy is now about offering variety at every level. Unlike competitors Samsung and Apple, which offer only touchscreen smartphones, the Finnish company&rsquo;s portfolio includes touch-and-type instruments as well. That should find takers locally, believe analysts. Most Indians prefer devices with a keypad that can be used if the touchscreen stops working. Indeed, for a company that&nbsp; lost marketshare because it failed to anticipate the craze for clamshell phones, Nokia&rsquo;s making it a point to be present across all formats: regular keypad phones, QWERTY mobiles, touchscreens and touch-and-type smartphones. &ldquo;In a market where the majority of customers are not technologically savvy [such as India], all these will co-exist,&rdquo;&nbsp;says Shivakumar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>The Smartphone Challenge</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Going by the numbers, Nokia is still the market leader in mobile handsets across India. But the crown&rsquo;s is looking increasingly shaky. The smartphone segment accounts for a minuscule portion of overall handset sales: barely 6% of the 213 million devices (expected sales) in 2011. iPhone may make headlines, but it&rsquo;s not a serious threat&mdash;it&rsquo;s not sold through regular retail channels and just 62,000 handsets were shipped to India in the quarter ending June 30, according to IDC. For Nokia, the real threat is Samsung. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">IDC&rsquo;s numbers for the October quarter show that in the smartphone segment, Nokia still led with a shipment share of 35.3%, but this is down from 45.8% in the preceding quarter. Samsung, on the other hand, jumped from 21% in Q2 to 26% in Q3 and is eyeing the <em>numero uno</em> position in the segment by next year something that is affirmed by Ranjit Yadav, Country Head of the mobile &amp; IT business at Samsung.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Abhishek Chauhan, Senior Consultant, ICT Practice, Frost &amp; Sullivan (South Asia &amp; Middle East), believes ruling over the smartphone segment in the long run will be very challenging for Nokia in India. &ldquo;Android has already proliferated and is a key challenge for Nokia. Sooner or later, Samsung could overtake Nokia as it is selling more in terms of value even though the volumes may be less than Nokia,&rdquo;&nbsp;he points out. Already, Android has a 42% share of the smartphone market, ahead of Nokia&rsquo;s Symbian. And shipments of Android smartphones grew by 90% in July-September in comparison to the previous quarter.</p>\n<p class="p3">This is why Nokia is counting on its February 2011 tieup with Microsoft&mdash;Shivakumar has said that Lumia, the first product under the partnership, is the most important launch for the company. Under the partnership, Nokia has adopted Windows Phone as its smartphone operating system; for the first time, it is creating devices that doesn&rsquo;t run on Symbian, which will continue to be seen on Nokia hansets until the transition is complete. Shivakumar believes Lumia&rsquo;s youthful design, the new operating system and apps will prove a winning combination in the Indian market. The main targets for the new phone will be youngsters just entering the job market and those looking to upgrade their existing handsets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But analysts are cautious about the Windows platform&rsquo;s prospects. &ldquo;The true test of the platform&rsquo;s viability will be a strong product pipeline and good customer uptake, with the resulting ability to attract a critical mass of application developer talent to compete with Apple and Android,&rdquo;&nbsp;says Richard Dineen, analyst at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets. Apple had over 500,000 applications while Android had over 400,000 apps according to Q3 2011 estimates. In contrast, Windows Phone 7.5 has less than 40,000 apps while Nokia itself has over 116,000 apps. &ldquo;We do not believe it is possible to gauge the Nokia-Microsoft partnership&rsquo;s success on this front until well into next year,&rdquo; Dineen adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">Brand consultant Sunil Alagh, Chairman, SKA Advisors believes the company also needs to refresh its image. &ldquo;It is no longer considered contemporary. Samsung addresses the market through innovation and youthfulness while newer domestic brands such as Micromax address them through pricing,&rdquo; he says. His solution: make the brand younger. &ldquo;Nokia is not a forgotten brand; it is just that it is now considered fuddy-duddy. It can be addressed by repositioning and bringing in new products that are contemporary,&rdquo;&nbsp;says Alagh.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Nokia is not a forgotten brand; it is just that it is now considered fuddy-duddy. It can be addressed by repositioning and bringing in new products" - Sunil Alagh, chairman, SKA Advisors</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">While Nokia claims to be addressing the youth segment through newer applications, devices and marketing campaigns, the reality seems to be different. Frost &amp; Sullivan&rsquo;s Chauhan believes Nokia is the preferred brand for the 35+ age group. Possibly it is the generation whose first mobile was a Nokia 10-15 years back and they believe in growing old with the brand. For the rest, Samsung seems to be the choice. &ldquo;Nokia has lost a bit in terms of the strategy around smartphones while Samsung has created growth. I don&rsquo;t see that reversing overnight,&rdquo;&nbsp;Chauhan says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Gartner&rsquo;s Gupta has a piece of advice for Nokia: &ldquo;When the Windows ecosystem develops and Nokia can bring mid-range devices based on the platform, it will change the game. There will be volume in the $300-350 price points and that is where Nokia can regain lost ground.&rdquo; Will that really happen or will Nokia remain the wallflower at the Indian handset party?&nbsp;</p>', 'After losing its hold over the Indian market, Nokia is trying to regain its lost ground.

(455, 16, '', 'Burman''s date with equities', '<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s a tradition the Burman family loves to keep. On every Friday, they meet for lunch at the family office in New Delhi&rsquo;s ITO area. During the meal they discuss everything from life to work. &ldquo;Friday has become the day when we get together and spend time,&rdquo; says Mohit Burman, a fourth-generation entrepreneur from the Burman family, promoters of Dabur. &ldquo;We started this tradition in 1997 and it continues till date.&rdquo; The lunch, while informal, gives the family a chance to discuss business plans and brainstorm. It was at one such lunch that Burman proposed his idea of entering the equity broking business. The idea found approval. In November 2011, Mohit and his younger brother, Gaurav Burman, bought a 25% stake in Esp&iacute;rito Santo Securities, the Indian unit of Portuguese bank Banco Esp&iacute;rito Santo, to offer&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">investment banking and institutional brokerage services. While Esp&iacute;rito will make an initial investment of around $10 million, the Burmans plan to invest $2 million (Rs 10 crore) in the joint venture. While that is hardly worth talking about any more, Burman says it is only seed capital and they will ramp up their investments as they go on.</p>\n<p class="p3">More important is the fact that the joint venture with Esp&iacute;rito&nbsp; marks Burmans&rsquo; entry into the highly competitive equity broking business at the most inopportune time, that too with an unknown partner. Mohit Burman&rsquo;s desire to scale up his finance business is understandable&mdash;he holds an MBA in finance from Babson Graduate School of Business, Massachusetts, and his first date was with Dabur Finance. After the unremarkable stint, in the 1990s with Dabur Finance, which no longer exists, the group ventured into the insurance sector with its first joint venture with ABN Amro bank in 2001 to market the bank&rsquo;s life insurance products. It then partnered Fidelity International and Aviva Life Insurance and brought them to India. Fidelity eventually bought out Mohit Burman&rsquo;s 25% stake but the family still holds a 74% stake in Aviva Life and a 10% stake in Universal Sompo General Insurance. So far, the Burmans have invested close to Rs 2,000 crore into the insurance business. So the equity broking may sound like a natural progression. But can the group really make its presence felt in this business?</p>\n<p class="p3">Burman says the partnership happened, in part, because of the personal equation his family shares with Esp&iacute;rito&nbsp; board members. &ldquo;We knew Esp&iacute;rito&rsquo;s board members well, through some of our overseas deals,&rdquo; says Burman. &ldquo;We wanted to get into the broking business and Esp&iacute;rito&nbsp; was looking for an Indian partner, so it clicked between us.&rdquo; He claims that financial services is Dabur&rsquo;s second largest focus area after consumer goods. In the past, the promoters have exited some of their financial services businesses, but he insists that there will be no exit from Esp&iacute;rito. On their part, Esp&iacute;rito&nbsp; officials declare that this was the reason for choosing Dabur, though it has no experience in investment banking. &ldquo;Like Esp&iacute;rito&nbsp; Santo, as a family business the Burmans invest for the long-term, which was an important consideration for us,&rdquo; says Nick Paulson-Ellis, Country Head, India, Esp&iacute;rito&nbsp; Santo Securities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Dabur has a strong interest in Africa, where Espirito Santo has a network, so we can help identify investment opportunities in Africa" - Nick Paulson-Ellis, country head, India, Espirito Santo Securtities</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Esp&iacute;rito&nbsp; has been in India since 2008, through its subsidiary Execution Noble, which has an institutional equity research team of 20, covering 75 Indian listed companies. Post the joint venture, Esp&iacute;rito&nbsp; has applied for equity broking licences, which it hopes to get in January-March 2012. It will also leverage Dabur&rsquo;s presence in Africa. &ldquo;Dabur has a strong interest in emerging opportunities in Africa, where Esp&iacute;rito&nbsp; Santo has a longstanding position and network, so we can help identify investment opportunities for Indian firms in Africa,&rdquo; says Paulson-Ellis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Poor Timing?</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Analysts are, however, sceptical about Esp&iacute;rito&rsquo;s success in India, given the timing. &ldquo;This is the wrong time to enter the broking business,&rdquo; says Kajal Gandhi, Analyst, ICICI Securities. &ldquo;Brokerage yields are shrinking because of an increase in futures and options trading where yields are the lowest and a decline in higher yielding cash and delivery segment,&rdquo; she adds.</p>\n<p class="p3">Gandhi says even existing investment banking players are looking at other sources of revenue such as the lending business, i.e., loan against pledged shares. &ldquo;Any new player will find it tough to operate in such an environment and they will need to cut operational costs to be profitable,&rdquo; she says. Brokerage yields in the derivative options turnover is 1-4 basis points (bps) compared to 10-12 bps for trading in the cash segment. In FY11, options constituted about 58% of overall equity turnover against 37% in the previous year, according to Icra.</p>\n<p class="p3">Gajendra Nagpal, CEO, Unicon Financial Intermediaries, a financial services company, agrees that these are difficult times for broking houses. &ldquo;Retail investors are missing and people are playing on the Nifty futures and options, algorithmic trading&mdash;all good for the liquidity of the market&hellip;but investors are disillusioned,&rdquo; he says. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Low trading volumes and an increase in costs is forcing broking houses to shut operations or downsize. In June this year, Alchemy Shares &amp; Stock Brokers closed its institutional broking business to focus on its asset management and wealth management businesses. Mata Securities has shut down its research division and there is speculation that at least three or four broking houses are looking for buyers. &ldquo;Quite a few broking houses are already on the block,&rdquo; says Nagpal. &ldquo;Only players with very deep pockets and patience will do well.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The Icra report says &ldquo;the weak operating environment could speed up consolidation, as small brokers may find it difficult to sustain profitability.&rdquo; Consolidation has started, with Anagram Capital acquired by Edelweiss Capital and Quant Capital by Reliance Capital. Banks are also acquiring broking houses. For instance, HSBC Bank bought IL&amp;FS Investsmart, StanChart acquired UTI Securities and Axis Bank acquired Enam Securities.</p>\n<p class="p3">Paulson-Ellis expects further consolidation in the broking sector. In fact, Ellis says his intention is to take advantage of this turmoil. &ldquo;We would like to build market share before the industry consolidates,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The market may worsen in a year or two and we will see broking consolidation, given the issue of lower business levels and overcapacity in broking.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Filling The Void</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">It&rsquo;s not just Esp&iacute;rito . Other foreign broking houses such as Jefferies, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and RBS are also trying to pick up market share left by brokerages that have shut shop. CJ George, Founder, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services, says foreign brokerages have an edge over domestic brokerages in the institutional broking business. &ldquo;Foreign brokerages have global clients, so it is easy for them to link India globally,&rdquo; says George. Esp&iacute;rito , which will be offering institutional equity broking along with investment banking, is perhaps banking on its global clients to make its India business profitable.</p>\n<p class="p3">Paulson-Ellis agrees that since market volumes are very thin, it will be challenging for the bank. Esp&iacute;rito hopes to differentiate itself by offering equity research, a trading platform that allows clients to trade in 16 markets, and the expertise to help corporations in their ambitions across Africa and Brazil.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With so many brokers competing for the same clients, Indian brokerages are likely to be stressed. Consequently, the weaker players will be squeezed out and the stronger ones will rise. More than a brand recall, Esp&iacute;rito needs to convince its foreign clients to put their money in India. Given the abysmal performance of the India market that is a tall order in these times. Additionally, if the European crisis blows ups, and clients turn risk averse, the flows may slow down to a trickle. Burman&rsquo;s equity dreams will have to wait. But will Esp&iacute;rito wait that long in an alien land? Historically, foreign brokerages in India have chosen to leave during times of turmoil.

In real estate, the shameful scam of last year and rising price escalation have throttled the sector.</p>\n<p class="p2">A closer look at Sundaram BNP Paribas Capex opportunities shows that of the total corpus of Rs 450 crore, a whopping 49.3%, amounting to Rs 221.85 crore, is held in cash. Explains Srividya Rajesh, fund manager, &ldquo;Order-book growth of the companies we invest in has been declining. Corporates have been holding back on spending on capex. Infrastructure bottlenecks coupled with low GDP growth and policy inertia haven&rsquo;t helped either and spending on both industrial and infrastructure capex is down by 50% compared with last fiscal. Also a decline in stock prices of the companies we invest in have compounded matters.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p2">She believes that more clarity is needed from the government if the corporates have to be enthused with confidence. &ldquo;Of the $1 trillion announced for <br /> infrastructure spending in the 12th five-year plan, how much translates into reality will determine which way our cash position moves. But investors should be patient and adopt a long term view,&rdquo; Rajesh adds.</p>\n<p class="p2">Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research, which tracks the mutual fund space, believes the weakening macro fundamentals and the global crises are to blame. &ldquo;The extreme volatility in the markets and policy inertia have prompted fund managers to take shelter in cash.

(458, 20, '', 'Good stock, bad stock', '<p class="p1">It was a good day after a bad year. Investors holding Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation (CESC) shares must have cheered, even if only briefly, the day the Union Cabinet cleared the proposal to allow FDI in multi-brand retail. On November 25, the company&rsquo;s stock rose valiantly by 8% to close at Rs 272.5, which was quite a comeback after the long downward spiral from its high of Rs 385 in January 2011. Of course, once the FDI proposal was put back on hold, the stock started sliding again.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">CESC, which generates and distributes power in Kolkata, Howrah and Noida, may not be such a recognisable name all over India but it owns Spencer&rsquo;s Retail, the much seen, multi-format retail chain. The Spencer adventure (merged&nbsp; in&nbsp; FY08) has been a nightmare for CESC&mdash;its stock price is down 45% over the past year (<em>see: Under Pressure</em>) purely because Spencer&rsquo;s is burning up Rs 9 crore every month. &ldquo;Though CESC is one of the most efficient power producers in India, it has not been able to get the valuation it deserves,&rdquo; says Kashyap Pujara, Analyst, Enam Securities in his report. FDI, it was hoped, could rescue Spencer&rsquo;s and, therefore, CESC. Alas, that is not to be, at least not anywhere in the near future.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Under pressure - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Sanjiv Goenka, Vice-Chairman, CESC, does not appear as perturbed as CESC&rsquo;s investors. &ldquo;The retail business in India, like anywhere in the world, is a long-gestation business that eventually makes profits with scale and operating efficiencies,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In FY11, Spencer&rsquo;s losses were about Rs 200 crore but they are expected to be substantially lower in the current year.&rdquo; How justified is Goenka&rsquo;s optimism? Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Grin And Bear It</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">Spencer&rsquo;s is funded by fresh debt and internal accruals from the flagship company CESC&rsquo;s power business. Analysts estimate that every year, out of the Rs 500-600 crore profit made by the power business, around Rs 150-200 crore goes into funding Spencer&rsquo;s. This largesse is expected to continue till the retail business breaks even. Meanwhile, CESC is exploring alternative funding options for Spencer&rsquo;s. Goenka says not only is he open to diluting a minority stake in the retail business, an IPO could also be considered. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">While it would make sense for CESC to get rid of its retail business, analysts say that it can&rsquo;t, not till the retail wing turns profitable anyway. &ldquo;CESC wants to sell a partial stake but it&rsquo;s not easy to find investors for a loss-making business,&rdquo; says Rohit Singh, Analyst, IDBI Capital Research.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"We are confident that Spencer''s losses will decline further in the current fiscal and hope that breakeven will happen in FY13 and or FY14" - Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman, CESC</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">So, instead, CESC is focusing its energies on turning Spencer around by increasing sales, shutting down unprofitable stores, stocking more high-margin private labels, lowering rent-to-sales, and expanding the hyper-market format in places where the Spencer&rsquo;s brand has strong consumer support. &ldquo;We hope to expand from 1 million sq ft to about 1.5 million sq ft in the next two years,&rdquo; Goenka says. &ldquo;We will fund it through a mix of debt and support from the holding company.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Turning around - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Some of the efforts seem to be paying off. &ldquo;Spencer&rsquo;s has already achieved the first milestone of consistent store EBITDA profitability for over 16 months now,&rdquo; says Goenka <em>(see: Turning around)</em>. Goenka is confident that losses will decline further in the current fiscal. Breakeven, he hopes, will happen in FY13 or FY14.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Will It?</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">PINC analyst Hitul Gutka is sceptical about that timeline. &ldquo;I think the retail business will break even sometime in FY15 or FY16,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The problem is that if the economic slowdown worsens in the next one or two years, footfalls will drop and, along with them, revenues.&rdquo; Gutka is not even sure if FDI in retail will make everything better. He notes, &ldquo;If new players come in with the opening up of FDI in retail, there will be aggressive pricing and competition will increase.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p2">Novonil Guha, Analyst, BRICS Securities, agrees that a breakeven is more likely in FY15. &ldquo;We think FY15 is when we will see a turnaround,&rdquo; he says. Till then retail will see a cash outflow of Rs 150 crore in FY12, Rs 95 crore in FY13, Rs 50 crore in FY14 and Rs 25 crore in FY15, for funding losses and capex.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Powered On</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">CESC&rsquo;s power business is profit-making and operates under a regulated business model where all its power is sold to its consumers in West Bengal at a tariff that is determined by the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission. In the transmission business, the company starts receiving payment from the state electricity board as soon as the transmission lines are made available and most of the costs are passed on to its consumers. CESC gets an assured Return on Equity (RoE) of 14% after tax on its power generation assets, and RoE of 15% after tax for its transmission and distribution business.</p>\n<p class="p2">Analysts say there is decent growth in volumes and tariffs. The company is operating in a power deficit environment where demand outstrips supply&mdash;though India has a low per capita power consumption, power deficit in the country is high at 13.1% (October 2011), according to Central Electricity Authority data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">CESC meets around 25% of West Bengal&rsquo;s requirements. The company has four operational power plants in Kolkata with a total capacity of 1,225 MW and two 600 MW projects under construction&mdash;at Haldia in West Bengal and at Chandrapur in Maharashtra. The Haldia project is to be commissioned in FY13; Chandrapur in FY14. The biggest problem that could face both the plants is a shortage of coal. &ldquo;Coal India has indicated its inability to supply more than 50% of the contracted quantity for new projects,&rdquo; says Goenka.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Assuming a coal shortage, Guha of BRICS Securities has lowered the plant load factor assumption for Chandrapur from 92% to 65%. &ldquo;This assumption is conservative because the company should be able to compensate part of the fuel shortage with supplies from Australia-based Resource Generation (CESC has a 14.8% stake) which is expected to start production in 2013,&rdquo; says Guha. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>The Real Risk</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">While Spencer&rsquo;s losses are a burden on the holding company&rsquo;s balance sheet, analysts say the correction in CESC&rsquo;s stock price is overdone. Given CESC&rsquo;s low-risk power business, the stock could give good returns from its current levels - it&rsquo;s trading at an estimated FY12 price-to-book ratio of 0.7 times. Guha says, &ldquo;CESC is available at a discount to its peers and given that losses in the retail business are declining, we think the stock is attractively valued.&rdquo; Most brokerages have a &lsquo;buy&rsquo; rating on the stock <em>(see: Keeping the faith)</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>Keeping the faith - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Nonetheless, while it&rsquo;s true that Spencer&rsquo;s has cut its losses, the future of the retail business still looks shaky, especially in the event of an economic slowdown. If a slowdown sets in, instead of turning profitable, the retail business could be worse off, as it was seen in FY09, when Spencer&rsquo;s losses climbed as high as a staggering Rs 37 crore per month. The bottom line: until the retail business turns around, the risk that CESC&rsquo;s stock price could see <br /> a further correction will continue to exist.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">It&rsquo;s a risk investors must consider before buying the stock.&nbsp;</p>', 'CESC''s power business is steady and profitable.

(459, 19, '', 'Hanging by a thread', '<p class="p1">As we enter Tirupur after a 90-minute journey from Coimbatore, the first thing that strikes us is how unremarkable the town is. Tirupur is the nerve centre of the garment export trade in India and the town supplies to leading fashion labels, including to Tommy Hilfiger, Levi&rsquo;s, Diesel, Reebok, as well as for retailers such as Walmart, Target and Mothercare. But it&rsquo;s so, well, nondescript. There are no large buildings, no flashy hoardings and certainly no one dressed to the nines in the latest fashion. Even the marketplace is just a small row of garment shops, where you can pick up Ralph Lauren Polo shirts at a tenth of the original price.</p>\n<p class="p3">You can&rsquo;t walk more than a few steps on any street without bumping into a company that is connected with the garments trade in some way. But not much seems to happen these days. For a weekday, Tirupur is more a ghost town than a bustling commercial hub. There are few people around and godowns are filled more with empty cartons.</p>\n<p class="p3">Getting locals to talk about the obvious slowdown, though, is far from easy. They&rsquo;re suspicious of anyone from the media&mdash;the industry got some bad press after an NGO posing as journalists uncovered cases of child labour and exploitation. When we finally coax entrepreneurs to speak, the sense of despair is palpable. Tirupur is the largest knitwear exporter in India, accounting for almost 80% of total exports.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"I have been in business since 1973 and the current slowdown is the worst I have ever seen" - A Sakthivel, president, Tirupur Exporters Association</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;I have been in business since 1973 and the current slowdown is the worst I have seen,&rdquo; says A Sakthivel, President of the Tirupur Exporters Association. Orders from Europe, which account for 65% of the Rs 12,500-crore&nbsp; revenues that Tirupur earns from garment exports, are down to a trickle as retailers see their sales plummet by 70% while most still trying to offload last season&rsquo;s inventory. &ldquo;Clients who used to buy 10,000 pieces are now ordering only 6,000,&rdquo; says S Krishna Kumar, who runs Kiwi Fashions, a mid-size export firm in Tirupur. His firm supplies European garment manufacturers such as Norprotex, Chantal SAS and lingerie manufacturer Bonneterie DeGroote. Kumar has seen his revenues come down 30% since 2009 to Rs 35 crore. He doesn&rsquo;t expect FY12 to be any better. Kumar isn&rsquo;t alone. Most exporters in Tirupur fear business will be lower by 25-30% this year. While Tirupur has about 1,500 knitting units and 2,500 garment-making units, only 50 do business of over #100 crore. Since Diwali, 25 units have closed down. Over the past year, almost 250 units have stopped production.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Watershed moment</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The problem didn&rsquo;t start in 2011; sales have been nearly flat for close to three years. The exporters&rsquo; troubles were aggravated in January 2011, when the Madras High Court ordered the closure of close to 700 bleaching and dyeing units in Tirupur after they failed to stop releasing effluents into the Noyyal River.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Only a handful of units that met pollution norms are now functioning while almost 90% of the units remain closed. Garment manufacturers who don&rsquo;t have integrated facilities have now been sending fabric to dyeing units across India. Not only has that increased costs by at least 15-20%, the delay has impacted deadlines.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The uncertainty over orders prompted some clients to take their business to Bangladesh until things settled down.&nbsp; &ldquo;Happy with the terms offered by exporters there, they have chosen to stay with Bangladesh,&rdquo; says Yogesh Kumar, Managing Partner of Soundra Exports. Bangladesh&rsquo;s exports are almost 10% cheaper as it enjoys a duty-free status in Europe. Lower labour costs and higher productivity add another 5-10% in terms of cost advantage. Indian exporters find it difficult&mdash;if not impossible&mdash;to compete at those rates. &ldquo;Globalisation will drive business out of Tirupur. Customers will move to low-cost destinations that offer a better value proposition,&rdquo; says Yoga Prakash. His company, Soundra Exports, has shrunk from Rs 50-55 crore in 2008 to Rs 30-35 crore.</p>\n<p class="p3">As if the delays and price differentials weren&rsquo;t enough, the European crisis came to a head in July-August. Orders were cancelled and several clients asked exporters to hold on to the finished goods for five or six months. The total loss so far, according to Sakthivel, is well over Rs 1,200 crore. Worse, the gap between fixed costs and income <br /> is widening.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;During the boom, suppliers used to extend credit to garment manufacturers. But now everyone insists on upfront payments. Those who are unable to fund their working capital needs are either scaling down business or shutting shop,&rdquo; says Senthil Kumar, CEO, Premier Export, a small-sized firm that supplies brands such as Billabong, Quick Silver and Land Rover in Europe and South Africa. The slowdown in demand and the closure of dyeing units in Tirupur wiped off two-thirds of his firm&rsquo;s revenues over the past three years reducing it to #5 crore. Senthil has let go of over 300 employees since 2008 and is down to just 100 workers now.</p>\n<p class="p3">With business drying up, the local economy, that so far thrived on the exports, has taken a beating. Real estate prices have crashed 35-40% in the last three years. &ldquo;Almost 30% of Tirupur&rsquo;s workforce has left town. They didn&rsquo;t get regular work and the cost of living is so high, they had no choice but to go elsewhere,&rdquo; says Senthil Kumar. People are heading to Coimbatore and Salem, where there are better chances of employment. Exporters are exploring other businesses including hotels and hospitals. Krishna Kumar has invested #7 crore in a hotel near Coimbatore to meet the <br /> needs of industries in Suzlon SEZ.</p>\n<p class="p3">Is the falling rupee helping at all? It does bring some relief, say exporters, but a conservative hedging strategy does away with much of the potential gain. Haunted by the losses they suffered in 2007-08, exporters are now sticking to vanilla hedges and almost 70% of the exports have been hedged around Rs 48 levels as no one anticipated the rupee would go any lower. That means only a third of all dollar realisations will see real benefits from the rupee depreciation. Besides, say exporters, cash-strapped clients are demanding higher discounts, which means any gains are being shared. &ldquo;These are very scary times. Tirupur got its business when European countries became uncompetitive. Since we are becoming uncompetitive in our pricing structure, business will move to other places. If the trend continues, the industry here will cease to exist,&rdquo; says Senthil Kumar glumly.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Day two: Coimbatore</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">If Tirupur&rsquo;s exporters are coming apart at the seams, how are their suppliers in Coimbatore faring? Not too well. Many of the textile mills that supply yarn to garment exporters in Tirupur and also export yarn are running up huge losses. Textile mills were the pride of Coimbatore but now they are slowly losing out to industries such as software, engineering and auto-ancillaries that are generating better employment opportunities. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The textile industry is reeling under heavy losses from soaring cotton prices and the export ban on yarn; lacklustre demand in the export markets could well be the last straw. There was a time when textile mills were running all through the year. Given the lack of demand, many mills are running at 50-60% capacity. Demand and currency fluctuations are nothing new but exporters and mill owners complain that, this time, their pain has been exacerbated by policy decisions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The ban on yarn exports, couldn&rsquo;t have been more ill-timed. The government halted the export of cotton yarn from December 1, 2010, until March 2011 to help meet domestic demand. Mirroring the rise in cotton prices, which increased by 66% in 2010, yarn prices were up 62%. The ban led to a glut in the domestic market and pulled realisations down, at a time when global demand was on the rise. Also, it disrupted clients&rsquo; supply chains. &ldquo;Work stopped at many factories in Europe and Japan due to non-availability of yarn and they were forced to source from other destinations. Indian exporters lost their credibility in the global market,&rdquo; says Dr K Selvaraj, Secretary General, South Indian Mills Association (Sima).</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Textile mills have lost almost Rs 11,000 crore between April and September 2011 on account of high-cost inventory" - Dr K Selvaraj, secretary general, South Indian Mills Association</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">And what followed was every textile mill owner&rsquo;s nightmare. &ldquo;By the time, exports were allowed in April 2011, the demand landscape had changed. Things had worsened in Europe and demand evaporated. Both cotton and yarn prices crashed,&rdquo; says R Elango of Sangeeth Mills, which manufactures yarn for both the export and the domestic market. While cotton prices came off the high of Rs 63,000 per candy (one candy is 356 kg) to Rs 30,000 per candy, yarn prices followed suit, falling from Rs 270 per kg to Rs 150 a kg leaving the mills holding a load of high cost inventory of raw materials and finished goods. While both cotton (Rs 38,000 per candy) and yarn prices (Rs 180 a kg) recovered, the losses on account of high-cost inventory and falling realisations are huge. &ldquo;Textile mills have lost Rs 11,000 crore between April and September this year,&rdquo; says Sima&rsquo;s Selvaraj. Now, given the increasing volatility in raw material prices and product realisations, the mills are keeping their inventory to the bare minimum. Most mills keep a raw material inventory of only a month now, compared to four months&rsquo; worth earlier.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">However, with the slump in revenues and profits, many mills will find it difficult to service loans taken under the Technology Upgradation Fund (TUF). Textile mills in Coimbatore have taken loans of over Rs 1.5 lakh crore. Sima has asked for a two-year moratorium on repayment of term loans and has asked that the working capital loans taken in the past year be converted into five-year term loans.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"It is risky to take a long term view on anything, be it currency or raw material prices" - B Sriramulu, managing director, KG Denim&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Mounting interest costs, pressure to repay loans and power shortage leading to higher fuel costs add to a list of problems. The falling rupee is of little comfort. &ldquo;Who would have predicted the rupee at 52 levels? It is a problem if you hedge and a problem if you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says B Sriramulu, MD, KG Denim, leading suppliers to Lee and Levi&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"It [ running a textile in Coimbatore] is like driving car without a steering wheel" - R Elango, managing director, Sangeeth Mills&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Coimbatore&rsquo;s mill owners fear that smaller mills may close if the slowdown continues. And there is no saying what the impact of the next policy decision will be. &ldquo;It is like driving a car without a steering wheel,&rdquo; says Sangeeth&rsquo;s Elango. This uncertainty comes at a time when competition is intensifying from Bangladesh, Cambodia, Vietnam, China and Pakistan, among others. But, there is some hope that Christmas sales in the US and Europe could help retailers clear their inventory and thereafter look to restock. &ldquo;The brands are waiting for Christmas before re-stocking. But we believe that the second half should be better.&rdquo; says B Sriramulu.

The secret? It&rsquo;s not all that hard to finish a course. Ravi K Sheth, Managing Director, Great Eastern Shipping (India) is a consistent half-marathon runner and tries to share this secret. And much to his amazement, very few believe him. &ldquo;People always tell me, &lsquo;Wow, you ran 21 kilometers? I would never be able to do that.&rsquo; And I tell them, they can. Unless you have a heart condition or a medical ailment there is no reason you cannot run 21 kilometers,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Sheth started running in 2005, when he was 44. He used to play squash before that. He began to find it claustrophobic and impossible to play in the summer. One evening, his brother-in-law who was training with Savio, a trainer, asked Sheth whether he would like to join them. He did. And ran for two or three kilometers the next morning. That was August 2005. In January 2006, he ran his first half marathon. Since then he has run in Mumbai, Delhi and Pondicherry.</p>\n<p class="p3">Sheth is part of a Mumbai-based group that runs three times a week. The longest runs are on Sundays. Age, Sheth affirms, is not an issue. &ldquo;We have people who are 57 and 60 and they are fitter than I am. Injuries can happen but the probability of that is much less than other sport. In squash, you will have a problem with your back and knees. You start and stop abruptly,&nbsp; bending and twisting. But you are upright when you run. As long as you warm up before and cool down after a run, you should be okay,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Running in a group is different. One, it motivates you to wake up. When the alarm goes off on Sunday, your strongest instinct is to switch it off and go back to sleep. But when there are people waiting for you, it forces you to get up. Second, you can run with a couple of people who help maintain your speed or &ldquo;give you speed.&rdquo; Runners build natural rhythms with others and this helps during the run. &ldquo;Ours is a fun group. On Sundays, after the run we sit around and chat or head out for breakfast. It&rsquo;s exercise and social activity,&rdquo; Sheth says.</p>\n<p class="p3">The first time Sheth ran the half marathon it was reported in his company&rsquo;s in-house magazine. That led to interest among his employees. Sheth then appointed Savio as the trainer for the company. He trains people at Worli Sea face round the year. &ldquo;People who are approaching 60 participate,&rdquo; he says. His ambition is now to run the half marathon in 2013 within 2 hours and 10 minutes.</p>\n<p class="p3">Sheth sees running as a great stress buster and an activity that makes him energetic and enthusiastic. &ldquo;When you run, it&rsquo;s you, your iPod and the road. It gives you time to think. And you feel a high at the end. It&rsquo;s like a drug,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s a high that a lot of people are discovering.

The jacket is structured in a manner that stylists deem &lsquo;slim-fit&rsquo; and what in the West is referred to as silhouette: the construction emphasises broad shoulders and a narrow waist, even if your body type is the opposite.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">I admire his <em>bandhgala</em>s but, for years, I&rsquo;ve been getting mine from a small outfit in Jaipur called Jodhpur Tailors. Jugal Chauhan at Jodhpur Tailors doesn&rsquo;t give a hoot about fashion in the big cities nor will he concede to the passing fads of the season. Once, fearing I might be putting on weight, I asked Jugal <em>Bhaisa&rsquo;ab</em> to make the <em>bandhgala</em> roomier at the waist. &ldquo;Get it stitched in Delhi,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">At Jodhpur Tailors, the silhouette is, if anything, sharper even than Rathore&rsquo;s. When he puts in a creased vent at the back in his corduroy <em>bandhgala</em>s with their elbow patches&mdash;a style that&rsquo;s difficult to achieve at most times&mdash;you can expect him to build a longer flap at the back. I asked him if he would give me similar flaps on the side instead of the back <em>and </em>lengthen the <em>bandhgala</em>, and Jugal Bhaisa&rsquo;ab&rsquo;s answer was: &ldquo;Get it done in Delhi.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">I <em>have </em>had <em>bandhgala</em>s done in Delhi, if only because it&rsquo;s more convenient. There was a time when Delhi&rsquo;s tailors prided themselves on fitting Presidents in <em>achkans</em>, but there&rsquo;s almost no one now who can give you a classic fit. No matter how much you ask, they end up looking&mdash;tubby. Perhaps it&rsquo;s got too used to dressing politicians.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Nonetheless, you will find <em>bandhgala</em>s off the rack. Nine Styles (in New Delhi and Guwahati) does a hybrid Jodhpur coat, which is not really a <em>bandhgala</em> (it doesn&rsquo;t have a collar) though it might meet the needs of the trendy <em>baraati</em> in a hurry. I like the fabric but the style with its piped edgings leaves me hoping that other contemporary adaptations will be less drastic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">I tried Louis Philippe&rsquo;s <em>bandhgala</em> version, which is definitely more wearable for someone my age. I wasn&rsquo;t partial to its concealed buttons, but it was the sizes that didn&rsquo;t work at all. I hope Louis Philippe won&rsquo;t cancel my gold card for saying they need more flexibility in sizing if they want to make as much of a success with their blazer-<em>bandhgala</em>s as with their Oxford suits.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to go to Wills Lifestyle this winter, but last year they had a number of inspired <em>bandhgala</em>s, and there was one by JJ Valaya that I particularly liked because it had the designer&rsquo;s fine eye for detail, but mostly because of its structured construction. Even the sizing was right, though I must confess I tend to buy from Wills only when they have a sale on.</p>\n<p class="p2">Taken into consideration, it&rsquo;s evident that the construction of the <em>bandhgala</em> is critical. Does Canali crack it? When it comes to tailoring you can&rsquo;t beat the Italians. When I tried the Canali, I knew they had got the style right. Canali explained the role of something that he called placket that gave the garment its firm shape. I liked the fit well enough, but at Rs 96,000 for the suit (Rs 69,000 for just the coat), it is more than a tad expensive as office-wear. And yet, it&rsquo;s doing well: over a hundred pieces sold in the first month of its introduction in Delhi, so it&rsquo;s clear that men are willing to pay the price if the fit is good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And yet, I know I&rsquo;m reconciled to going to Jodhpur Tailors because nothing comes as close in style&mdash;even if it means that the request for an appointment last month has been accommodated only in February. You can&rsquo;t hurry bespoke, even if it is a hole-in-the-wall in Jaipur rather than the rarefied salons of Delhi.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>&mdash;Kishore Singh is a delhi-basedwriter and curator</strong></p>', 'How to wear one without loking like a runaway baraati', '17', '', 0, '', 'open-up-to-the-bandhgala-462', 456, 1, 0, 0, 13, 'Open up to the bandhgala', 'How to wear one without loking like a runaway baraati', '', '', '', 'Bandhgala,Jodhpur coat,Prince coat', 0, NULL, '2015-02-09 12:26:06', '2015-03-02 14:48:07', '2012-01-21', 0),
(463, 24, '', 'Winning ''em over', '<p class="p1">It has been one of the more unfortunate trends of the last few years&mdash;companies and their stewards have shaken up investor trust rather rudely. <em>Winning Investors Over</em> is positioned as a survival kit for managers who want to regain and sustain investor confidence. It certainly does not, at first glance, appear to be a book for that long-suffering investor. But it is. No, really. Baruch Lev, distinguished professor of accounting and&nbsp;finance at NYU&rsquo;s Stern School of Business, has some deep insights to offer on the right ways in which a company can engage its investors. Lev challenges business leaders with short-term goals to rethink their beliefs. He does this with concrete real-life examples and irrefutable data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The book deals with three broad themes. The first relates to handling emergencies: when performance levels come to an abrupt and unexpected halt, earnings start to slow down, forecasts are missed and there are event-driven downsides. It then takes a long-term view of regaining and maintaining investors&rsquo; trust. Finally, it deals with corporate governance issues, including &lsquo;myths&rsquo; on short-termism, the pitfalls and methods while dealing with activist investors, and issues of managerial compensation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">To Lev&rsquo;s credit, a critical, empirical and exhaustive discussion illuminates each subject. Lev suggests that while elevated stock prices can temporarily lower the cost of capital and make a company attractive to employees, it&rsquo;s better to resist the temptation to &lsquo;ride the tiger&rsquo; and cool-off investor enthusiasm. In the long run, he says, credibility wins over manipulations like sales dumping, cost cuts or &lsquo;earnings management&rsquo;.</p>\n<p class="p3">The author calls for communication that combines hard (quantitative) and &lsquo;hardened soft&rsquo; (&lsquo;soft&rsquo; being that which can be hyped) information. Always augment the narrative with numbers, he advises. The focus should be on enhancing credibility with investors through frankness and integrity.</p>\n<p class="p3">Managers should be given operating instructions to always resist the temptation to manipulate, no matter how easy or non-consequential it may look, and told that they must keep frank communication open during tough times, and come out with the bad news quickly.</p>\n<p class="p3">Surprisingly, overpriced shares are as hazardous as grossly undervalued shares because they lead to a vicious cycle of corporate overspending and earnings manipulation. As for the argument that overpriced equity makes for cheap acquisition currency, Lev points out that when goodwill is impaired in the longer term, it only leads to massive ill-will.</p>\n<p class="p3">In India, listed companies (especially some subsidiaries of multinationals), hoard cash because they fear no attack. They use it to fund growth plans of their fully-owned subsidiaries. They signal that they are unwilling participants in Indian capital markets even though in today&rsquo;s hyper-communicated world their loss of credibility here will ultimately tarnish their parent company and its cost of capital. A whole chapter on &lsquo;hoarding&rsquo; shareholders&rsquo; money would, in fact, be a good lesson on ethical corporate behaviour.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Empirical studies have proved that long-term investors dominate the capital markets. Lev shows how successful managers, like successful investors, manage both the short and long term. Voted by <em>Accounting Today</em> as one of the 100 most influential people in the accounting profession for four years running, Lev&rsquo;s wisdom is pithy and profound by turns.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Insights</p>\n<p class="p3">Flying together</p>\n<p class="p1">The more an industry is deregulated, the more it gets concentrated in a few hands.

But it didn&rsquo;t work out that way. Eight mega carriers dominate 94% of the US aviation market. The oligopolistic tendencies aside, there&rsquo;s another reason for the interest in airline acquisitions&mdash;glamour. It is apparently more prestigious to own an airline than an NFL franchise.

His neck was stiff, his back hurt, his very bones ached. He had a two-hour flight to Mumbai followed by your everyday traffic snarls before he could think about relaxing a bit. He desperately wanted to unwind. He would have paid an arm and a leg (all pains included) for a good foot massage but where was he going to find a spa &mdash; a quick web search confirmed there wasn&rsquo;t even one nearby &mdash; and the time to enjoy it? What if an affordable spa materialised on call? It was a tantalising daydream that morphed, well, into a vague business concept.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Initially, I wondered if I could start a spa of sorts at airports but that was an expensive proposition,&rdquo; recalls the 32-year-old Kerala-born engineer. &ldquo;I wanted to enter the goods and services industry since my days at Yale. I was sure there was an idea there somewhere.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Patil bought a vanity van, put in it a few modcons and CityBliss, the Mumbai-based spa-on-wheels, was set rolling. But why choose a van? &ldquo;The math was simple,&rdquo; reveals Patil, a consultant for Tata Consultancy Services back when he had his ooh-ah-ouch moment, in a manner of speaking. &ldquo;The [van&rsquo;s] diesel cost per month is lower than renting space in south Mumbai.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Ice cream truck for adults</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Patil and his friends pooled in $100,000 to get started in March 2010. They offered a relaxing spa experience for stressed-out corporate executives as they shuttled between meetings or headed home after work. A few trial runs later, CityBliss was formalised and registered. Patil started by targeting regular spa-goers with six basic services &mdash; foot, face and head massages, facials, pedicures and manicures. There was no budget for marketing, but word got around and local media was not far behind. Customers got curious and money started flowing in. &ldquo;Airport transfers weren&rsquo;t really part of the storyboard,&rdquo; says Patil, but corporate customers now use the CityBliss van before and after a flight.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>CityBliss - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Each personalised service, all fully-clothed and requiring only the removal of footwear, takes 30-60 minutes and costs between Rs 900 and Rs 3,000. And drowning the din of traffic are the soothing sounds of the ocean that are piped in. Also, the drivers are trained to provide a smooth and timely ride. Apart from the odd pothole that defies wheeled luxury, guests do not feel like they are in a van at all.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Primary spa-goers still bring in 70% of revenue but customers are also gifting, a regular source of income he hadn&rsquo;t anticipated, Patil adds. There are now more calls inquiring about the details of gifting than self-using customers. The average gift, Patil says, is worth Rs 2,500 and is valid for a year. &ldquo;Women gift a neck rub to their husband and come in for a foot massage as well,&rdquo; he says of the typical gifting behaviour.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">CityBliss is expanding slowly. Another therapist has joined the existing two servicing around 10 people a day.&nbsp; While business was slow in the beginning, the demand now gets overwhelming at four in the evening &mdash; the peak travel time. There has been a 15% increase in footfalls over the last six months and although he is cagey about his revenue figures, Patil says he has broken even and revenue has risen 15% in the last six months. To improve his margins, Patil has also hiked his prices by 10% and remains confident that his customers will keep coming back.</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Tough spots</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">The business hasn&rsquo;t been without its speed bumps and diversions. When CityBliss was registered, Patil had to painstakingly explain his idea to the traffic police department. Mumbai&rsquo;s infamous &lsquo;massage parlours&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t help. &ldquo;It was difficult convincing customers that we are a genuine spa,&rdquo; Patil says with a laugh. &ldquo;Others were looking for a more elaborate spa experience like a certain gentleman who wanted to take his shirt off.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The more serious problem is that of expansion. &ldquo;The biggest issue,&rdquo; Patil says, &ldquo;is the dead miles the van travels between customers.&rdquo; To cut them down, Patil wants to add 16 vans to his fleet in the next two years. They will function in the suburban Mumbai clusters he calls micromarkets &mdash; locations based on his inventory of customer requests. Therefore, the expanded fleet&rsquo;s seven locations will be south Mumbai, Worli-Mahim, Bandra-Juhu, Andheri-Goregaon, the entire stretch of the Western Express Highway, Matunga-Chembur-Ghatkopar, and Powai-Thane.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"The biggest problem is the dead miles the van travels between customers. Cutting them down will save a lot of costs" - Sandeep patil, founder, CityBliss</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">More vans will need more money but, currently, every extra hire is coming at the cost of Patil&rsquo;s salary. &ldquo;We are looking for debt funding but in the current climate, everything is difficult,&rdquo; he rues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">He has sent feelers to the right people via TiE, the entrepreneurial group of which he is a member, and they have recommended he approach banks for debt.

From the first outlet in Alsa Mall, one of the earliest malls in the Madras of those days, Hot Breads has since grown to 31 outlets in Chennai and Pondicherry.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">&nbsp;<strong>The icing on the cake</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">&ldquo;While most successful fast food, bakery and restaurant chains attribute their&nbsp; success to location, I would attribute a substantial part of Hot Breads&rsquo; success to Mahadevan&rsquo;s product development skills,&rdquo; says Subbu Subramaniam, founder, MCap Advisors, who was on the board of B&amp;M Hot Breads until recently. He filled buns with curry, potato and gram, and croissants with chicken and <em>paneer tikka</em>. Those are top sellers along with cream pastries, not only in India but Paris, Toronto and New York.</p>\n<p class="p7">Mahadevan took Hot Breads to Dubai in 1995. There was no looking back after that &mdash; Hot Breads has 44 outlets in the US, Canada, West Asia, Far East and Africa. If selling bread in Chennai was a challenge, selling bread made by an Indian overseas was a bigger risk. &ldquo;I knew I had to innovate to be successful there,&rdquo; says Mahadevan. His decision to choose locations with a sizeable Indian population worked to his advantage. &ldquo;He was smart enough to follow the Indian diaspora overseas, which created a connect,&rdquo; says Y Rama Rao, managing director and CEO, Spark Capital. &ldquo;That is one of the factors for his success.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7">Mahadevan recollects how a couple travelled from New York to the Hot Breads outlet in Edison, New Jersey, because they went on their first date to Hot Breads back home in Chennai. &ldquo;Creating that kind of recall is important for any brand to be successful,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>Slightly burnt edges&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">It hasn&rsquo;t always been sweet going. When Mahadevan tried to franchise the Hot Breads brand across the country in 2000, it didn&rsquo;t work very well. There was inconsistency in offerings and it proved to be the undoing of the national rollout. As launching overseas outlets took up his attention, Mahadevan decided to sell a 50% stake in the domestic business in 2001 to the Bhartia Group, which owns the Domino&rsquo;s chain in India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7">Hot Breads was rechristened B&amp;M Hot Breads.&nbsp; However, expansion under the new partnership met with little success. When they opened three branches in Delhi, none of them did well and were closed down. &ldquo;In the food business unlike, say, the mobile phone business where the product is being made by X, distributed by Y and serviced by Z, service quality and consistency in product offering is critical,&rdquo; says Mahadevan. &ldquo;Unless you can to maintain that, it&rsquo;s difficult to succeed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7"><strong>"Unless you can maintain service quality and consistency in product offering, it''s difficult to succeed" - M Mahadevan, founder, Hot Breads</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7">He then decided to stick to Chennai and Pondicherry, where he has greater control over quality. Plans are underway to launch six more outlets at an investment of about Rs 20 lakh per outlet. If the Bhartias agree, Bangalore comes up next.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>More helpings&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">Recognising the huge demand for <em>desi khana</em> among Indians overseas, Mahadevan, with his Hot Breads experience, took the first Saravana Bhavan outlet abroad in 2000 (as a consultant), following it up with another 19. He has also helped set up over 50 restaurants overseas, including branches of Anjappar, Wang&rsquo;s Kitchen, Paragon and Nala&rsquo;s Appakadai.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7">Side by side, Mahadevan introduced Chennai to international cuisines with Benjarong, Zara, Don Pepe and The French Loaf (an upmarket version of Hot Breads). These restaurants are managed through a company called Oriental Cuisines where Chennai-based private equity firm, Peepul Capital, has taken a 50% stake.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mahadevan&rsquo;s strength has been identifying a market and fine-tuning brands to meet demand,&rdquo; says Rao.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7">Mahadevan attributes his success to the people working with him. &ldquo;Employees play a very important role in customer experience,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It takes just one bad experience for customers to walk away and never return.&rdquo; According to him, in a city like Chennai, where there isn&rsquo;t a large floating population, repeat business is very crucial. That&rsquo;s why he places great emphasis on employee training.</p>\n<p class="p7">In India, all the Hot Breads outlets put together grossed around Rs 25 crore with 20% growth in revenues on a same store basis in the past one year. Together with his restaurants, revenues are around Rs 120 crore. Mahadevan hopes to maintain the same growth over the next year as well. Hot Breads&rsquo; international outlets earn around Rs 150 crore annually.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7">While revenue growth is important, the focus at Hot Breads is&nbsp;always profitability, &ldquo;As an entrepreneur, my focus has been on the bottomline because if my business doesn&rsquo;t generate cash, I cannot expand the business,&rdquo; says Mahadevan. Hot Breads is generating net margins of 14-15% on outlets &mdash; both within India and overseas. And these outlets are running profitably, so internal accruals take care of expansion.</p>\n<p class="p7">Sarala Kumar&rsquo;s resolutions are simpler. On her way back from gym, she stopped at Hot Breads, ordered a fresh pineapple cake and was tempted to pick up the new Irish cream pastry. &ldquo;Let me just try it once, I thought&hellip;&rdquo;</p>', 'M Mahadevan''s serial food entrepreneurship has started to pay off deliciously', '6', '', 0, '', 'taste-of-dough-468', 462, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Taste of dough', 'M Mahadevan''s serial food entrepreneurship has started to pay off deliciously', '', '', '', 'M Mahadevan,Hot Breads,Oriental Cuisines', 0, NULL, '2015-02-09 15:04:01', '2015-02-09 15:27:56', '2012-02-04', 0);

(469, 12, '', 'Ruins to riches', '<p class="p1">Dawn is just breaking as we turn away from the highway into Tranquebar, a Danish settlement from 1620-1845 CE, now a sleepy village in the Nagapattinam district of Tamil Nadu. The car rumbles over a nondescript main street and turns into an immaculate driveway lined with manicured lawns. Up ahead looms a Neemrana &lsquo;non-hotel&rsquo;, the over 150-year-old Bungalow on the Beach. In 2005, when Neemrana leased the property from its now-deceased owner, the building was in ruins. The foundation of its colonnade could not be found, beams and rafters had been sold, ficus trees had grown roots in the walls, and the roof had collapsed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">This &lsquo;honest representation of the traditional architecture of the Danish colonial period in India&rsquo; now features thick &lsquo;breathable&rsquo; lime wash walls, <br /> coloured stucco plaster bathrooms, a &lsquo;madras terrace&rsquo; and five unique rooms. Guests sip tea in the low-hung, breezy &lsquo;verandahs of the tropics&rsquo; and watch waves boom in the ocean just beyond the boundary wall. Indeed, it&rsquo;s not just the Bungalow that&rsquo;s glowing with care, three other heritage buildings nearby have been restored, their surrounds beautiful with gazebos and courtyards. And Tranquebar keeps pace with the footsteps of tourists. At the bustling craft centre-cum-caf&eacute;, a popular meeting point opposite the charming Nayak House, women serve honey crepes, lemon cakes and iced tea to appreciative patrons. Really, who would have thought Tranquebar had so much to offer?&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">Aman Nath and Francis Wacziarg did. At over 25 properties in 18 destinations all over India, &lsquo;Neemranification&rsquo; has come to mean sustainable heritage tourism that supports local communities and provides authentic Indian hospitality to visitors. &ldquo;When we started, we were neither architects nor hoteliers but we felt we had to restore instead of complain,&rdquo; says Nath. He first met Wacziarg, a Frenchman who holds an Indian citizenship, when they authored a book together over three decades ago. Their flagship property, the 1464 CE Neemrana Fort on the highway between Delhi and Jaipur, remains an unparalleled feat in restoration.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">For guests, a heritage hotel is a luxury getaway in traditional, historical settings. For those in the business, on the other hand, it&rsquo;s often about red tape, the usual hassles of running a hospitality venture and back-breaking work, including restoration activities that may never end. But it&rsquo;s also about tapping into a fast-growing business avenue as travel habits among Indians and foreigners evolve to focus on the experience. And three companies, at least, have learned now to give their guests just that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7"><strong>Age appropriate</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">If Neemrana is a standalone effort, WelcomHeritage invests ITC&rsquo;s corporate might in turning forgotten palaces, forts and <em>haveli</em>s into heritage hotel experiences. Only four of its 40 properties were built after 1950 (a prerequisite to falling under the &lsquo;heritage&rsquo; category), but &ldquo;Every WelcomHeritage property has a secret to share and a story to tell,&rdquo; says SC Sekhar, executive vice president, ITC Hotels. For instance, the transformation of Fernhills Palace in Ooty, an all-suite extravaganza with rooms the size of modern city apartments and a Durbar Hall with genuine gold paintwork, took nearly a decade.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">CGH Earth, which has only five exquisitely restored properties, was among the first movers who transformed Kerala into the international destination that it is today. The smallest of the three players has limited its presence to Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, earning renown for concepts like Chittoor Kottaram, a lovingly restored single-key palace in Cherranelloor, about an hour&rsquo;s drive from Ernakulam. &ldquo;The basic concept came about because we wanted to be very local in the experience we were offering,&rdquo; says Shilendran M, vice president, sales, CGH Earth. The company has a clutch of properties that were constructed afresh but with indigenous aesthetics. &ldquo;Restoration was not something we went looking for but something that came our way.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p5">Heritage hotels require an unusually holistic business model. Every property is unique, making standardised costing and estimates nearly impossible. In a place like Pondicherry, where land costs are very high and there are strict laws governing heritage structures, the cost of restoring an old property could, in fact, be higher than building a new one. On the other hand, in a remote location, a heritage property does not have significant commercial value by itself till it&rsquo;s developed and promoted with a hotel in mind. &ldquo;It all depends upon the building, its condition and its location,&rdquo; says Thomas Dominic, director-projects, CGH Earth. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to find the right balance of [commercially viable] attributes in a heritage building.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">Palaces, forts, <em>haveli</em>s and large residences were constructed for purposes other than development into hotels. They come into the hotels sector only when the families that own them are not able to maintain them anymore. &ldquo;Hence, the role of managers in operating and marketing such properties,&rdquo; says Sekhar.&nbsp;Indeed, ownership rarely changes hands in heritage properties &mdash; long lease, licence and marketing agreements are the most common basis for assimilation into a chain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">New hotels, however, are all about location. Indeed, a private developer cannot afford to restore a building unless its location and condition can sustain a resort. &ldquo;Tariffs are arrived at by looking at market rates, not the amount spent on property,&rdquo; says Nath. Although often spoken of in the same breath as &ldquo;the Tajs and Oberois&rdquo;, the tariff pricing in heritage hotels is comparatively lower than conventional properties. This is partly because the Ministry of Tourism&rsquo;s classification guidelines do not allow heritage hotels to be categorised with star ratings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">Break-even and returns invariably depend on the investment involved, location, tariff and high season. &ldquo;If restoration was just a 2+2=4 thing, then many more people would have been into it,&rdquo; says Nath. The Oberoi Group rejected Neemrana Fort before it was&nbsp;restored by Nath and Wacziarg and became the flagship of their enterprise. Despite the market for the heritage hotel experience, none of the hotel groups present at the pre-bid meets of the properties Neemrana is currently developing in Tijara and Patiala actually bid for them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">&ldquo;No two properties are the same,&rdquo; says Nath. &ldquo;Restoration can be both much cheaper and much more expensive. You cannot compare Umaid Bhawan with its modern construction today &mdash; its total cost in the 1930s was Rs 90 lakh. It would not be enough to build the Neemrana Fort&rsquo;s ramparts today.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p7"><strong>The road not taken</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">Some heritage resorts have dared to go off the tourist trail to create a destination by celebrating its very isolation &mdash; Neemrana&rsquo;s Darbargadh Palace in Morvi, Gujarat, is somewhere between the highway that connects Ahmedabad to Kutch; WelcomHeritage&rsquo;s upcoming Shiva Vilas Palace is located in Sandur in eastern Karnataka&rsquo;s Bellary district; CGH Earth&rsquo;s Kalari Kovilakom, a minimalist &lsquo;palace for Ayurveda&rsquo;, is in Kollengode in the foothills of Annamalai.</p>\n<p class="p5">But the location, always a paramount concern in the hospitality industry, can be a challenge in more ways than one. Apart from the absence of water and electricity, &ldquo;carrying construction equipment into the countryside is difficult,&rdquo; Sekhar says. &ldquo;Migration of manpower is another problem.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p5">Restoration efforts are even viewed with suspicion. &ldquo;People think only criminals want to buy ruins &mdash; for smuggling or some other underhand activity,&rdquo; laughs Nath. &ldquo;Then there are those who want to fleece us because they think we are idiots with too much money.&rdquo; Of course, Neemrana is also approached with a requests to restore properties every month.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">Restoration is carried out in stages and depends on the size, location and condition. The original structure of the building is retained as much as possible; even the materials used are similar. But unlike the structured road map of modern hotel construction, no blue prints are handy. &ldquo;Sometimes you might end up discovering a tunnel while boring a 4-foot wall, which makes the exercise even more fascinating,&rdquo; says Sekhar. Improvisation then plays a big part. &ldquo;All credit to our masons for finding inventive ways and saving us a fortune,&rdquo; says Nath. &ldquo;We were able to build 12 rooms at Neemrana Fort for just #30 lakh.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">In a resource-starved nation that&rsquo;s developing rapidly, sites of historical importance are especially vulnerable in the absence of strong government intervention to protect them. The Archaeological Survey of India&rsquo;s 24 circles are empowered but frequently ineffective because they are vested with too many responsibilities. Intach&rsquo;s database lists more than 60,000 heritage sites in major cities &mdash; Jaisalmer alone has 500 sites. &ldquo;Although heritage conservation has the government&rsquo;s support, heritage buildings need more tangible action like legal protection and financial incentives but that&rsquo;s not forthcoming yet,&rdquo; says Ajit Koujalgi, Auroville-based architect with Intach, Pondicherry. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">Despite their commercial principles, heritage hotels have given new life to buildings of historical importance. And it&rsquo;s contagious. After Neemrana restored Hotel de l&rsquo;Orient nearly 12 years ago, not only have several standalone heritage hotels come up in Pondicherry, WelcomHeritage&rsquo;s Calve (awarded the UNESCO Heritage Award of Merit) and CGH Earth&rsquo;s Maison Perumal have lent authentic style to the hitherto neglected former French colony.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">&ldquo;I am a trained architect but I learned a lot working with a client like Neemrana on Hotel de l&rsquo;Orient,&rdquo; says Koujalgi. &ldquo;The original structure was in an absolutely terrible state. It was felt that nobody in his right mind would think the building was worth saving. Not any more, of course.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>', 'Three hotel chains have successfully mastered the art of transforming heritage buildings into paying propositions ', '34', '', 0, '', 'ruins-to-riches-469', 463, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'Ruins to riches ', 'Three hotel chains have successfully mastered the art of transforming heritage buildings into paying propositions ', '', '', '', 'Heritage hotels,Heritage buildings', 0, NULL, '2015-02-09 15:43:12', NULL, '2012-02-04', 0),
(470, 16, '', 'Judging books', '<p class="p1">So, which were the bestselling Indian books of 2011? Until recently, you could have had every author in the country hold up his or her magnum opus as the readers&rsquo; favourite and there&rsquo;d be no way to dispute it. The lack of recording standards meant any writer could add prefixes like &ldquo;bestselling&rdquo; or &ldquo;leading&rdquo; to their name, even as publishers and bookstores grappled with royalties and inventories.</p>\n<p class="p3">There was probably a collective sigh of relief when Nielsen introduced its BookScan service in India. The global information and measurement company provides real-time data on book sales across retailers. It tracks 80,000 different book purchases worth #8 crore each week. And year-to-date, it has data on sales worth Rs 328 crore from 13 million book sales across 386,400 titles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Publishers pay for the results, but it is more of a partnership with the retailers. In the past 15 months, the company has signed on 22 retailer groups, including large chains such as Crossword, Landmark, Odyssey and Flipkart and smaller players of repute like Connexions, Galgotias and Full Circle.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">For both publishers and retailers, it&rsquo;s proving to be a good strategy to have accurate numbers for book sales. The weekly sales charts that retailers are given free in exchange for sales data helps them manage their supply chain and negotiate prices with publishers (based on the average selling price revealed by BookScan). &ldquo;It helps retailers in two ways,&rdquo; explains Deepinder Kapany, vice president and head, books and entertainment business, Reliance Retail. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need multiple sources to locate a book, and the consolidated sales data from different retailers helps in better inventory control.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">For publishers, too, the benefits outweigh the cost. &ldquo;They can now take reprint decisions and frame inventory, distribution and marketing policies based on information from a third party, provided without any bias, and with an established methodology to track sales,&rdquo; says Vikrant Mathur, associate director, Nielsen BookScan Practice.</p>\n<p class="p3">Of course, the Nielsen analysis is not a total market measure. &ldquo;They cover about 70% of the organised Indian book market and the only way in which they can improve is if more and more retailers go electronic and offer them data,&rdquo; says Anantha Padmanabhan, vice president, sales, Penguin India. The trouble is that many retailers in India do not have standardised billing and systems, and even the ones that do are wary of giving out data. Bookscan is expanding slowly but publishers and retailers aren&rsquo;t complaining.

(471, 16, '', 'Playing their song', '<p class="p1">The 75,000 people who headed to Candolim Beach in December were not there for the sand or surf. What had drawn them to Goa was Sunburn, the annual electronic dance music festival that has its roots in Goan trance. Seven stages and over 90 artistes kept the music going at the three-day party on the beach, with a line up that included Infected Mushroom and DJs Axwell and Funkagenda. But it was not fun in the sun for everybody at Sunburn. There were entire teams of people hard at work and, no, we are not talking of the event organisers. Brands such as Absolut, Lenovo, Gitanjali, Canon and Lakm&eacute; were busy working the crowds to connect with potential and existing customers. While Lakm&eacute; found the perfect opportunity to test its new range of sun protection products, Canon India was persuading revellers to shoot pictures with its cameras to extend the brand&rsquo;s &lsquo;cherish every moment&rsquo; positioning. Lenovo invited amateur DJs to use its software to submit song entries online. The winning entry got a chance to perform at Sunburn and in the subsequent &lsquo;hangover&rsquo; tours.</p>\n<p class="p3">It is not only Sunburn. As demand for live, youth-oriented music festivals picks up across India, they are increasingly showing up on the radars of consumer brands and advertisers. Shailendra Singh, joint MD of event management firm Percept, which organises the Sunburn Festival, explains the reason behind the popularity of such gigs. &ldquo;Anyone can go to the music store, buy the latest album and listen to it. Events like Sunburn are places to experience the music, and the creative energy that it inspires,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"Events like Sunburn are places to experience the music and the creative energy that it inspires" - Shailendra Singh, joint managing director, Percept&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Of course, they are nowhere close to the scale and popularity of a Glastonbury or the Lollapalooza, but events like the Storm Festival featuring alternative music at Coorg, rock and trance music festival Escape by the Lake at Naukuchiatal near Nainital, and the NH7 Weekender at Pune are quickly building a local fan following. Sunburn&rsquo;s 75,000 aside, over 25,000 people attended the second round of the Bacardi NH7 festival, in 2011, while nearly 13,000 people have &lsquo;liked&rsquo; the Storm Festival 2012 page on Facebook, even before the event happens (scheduled for January 20 and 21, 2012). Which explains why brand managers are in a great rush to book their places at these events.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While Bacardi is the title sponsor of the NH7 festival, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra attaches its prefix to the Mumbai Blues festival, and Red Bull has the eponymous Red Bull Bedroom Jam for amateur bands. Meanwhile, Karnataka Tourism, Budweiser, Coca-Cola, Peter England and Vladivar vodka have hitched their wagons to the two-day musical camp-out at Coorg. &ldquo;Music is the easiest way to connect to the youth today. It reflects their moods, attitude and lifestyle. Any company that manages to establish a musical connect automatically becomes cool and hip,&rdquo; says Pankaj Raj Kumar, national head of Jagran Solutions, a below-the-line branding firm that counts brands like Nokia, Wrigley&rsquo;s and Bacardi among its clients. Such events also provide the perfect opportunity to connect with the right kind of customers. More than half of India&rsquo;s population is under 25 and youth music events are typically attended by urban elite in the 18-35 age group &mdash; and that&rsquo;s the holy grail for most consumer brands in the country.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s youth ask for the latest gadgets, are willing to pay more for extra features and are willing to indulge and take time out for their passions,&rdquo; says Canon India senior vice president Alok Bhardwaj. Music-related events, Canon has found, help the company create a youth-oriented image &mdash; and that has to be good for sales. Lenovo thinks similarly. &ldquo;Our association with Sunburn will help us establish a strong connect with the youth, our core target audience,&rdquo; says Shailendra Katyal, the company&rsquo;s marketing director.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>The social network</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Live events help companies break through the brand clutter and, thanks to the popularity of social networking sites, it has become easier for event organisers and people who want to participate in such activities to come together more easily. For instance, Bacardi India has a &ldquo;Like it Live&rdquo; page on Facebook that allows people to vote for the artist they would like to see performing in person. Based on the number of votes, in December, it brought Romanian singer-songwriter Alexandra Stan to perform at Mumbai&rsquo;s Hard Rock Caf&eacute; (HRC), to a packed audience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Nokia also turned to social networks when it decided to create flash mobs to promote its latest phone, Lumia. Random people were brought together at malls across Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore to dance on a pre-decided song. &ldquo;Increasingly, road shows or having a van stand outside a college is not enough. This is where the flash mob idea came in. It is getting us great visibility, and online mentions have exploded. We want to be a cool, hip, young brand and the idea of flash mobs have clearly worked,&rdquo; says Viral Oza, marketing director at Nokia.</p>\n<p class="p3">Connecting with potential customers is just half the story. More importantly, live events engage the customer and gets them personally involved in the brand &mdash; and that helps in creating stickiness. &ldquo;Mass media advertising tends to be &lsquo;one-way&rsquo; communication, while the sponsorship of an event allows dialogue, experience and, finally, trial,&rdquo; says Kiran Khalap, founder of brand consultancy Chlorophyll. He points out that these engagements lead to creation of brand ambassadors and tribes who create a larger family of brand lovers through &lsquo;word of mouth&rsquo;. &ldquo;This is possible only when a brand gets involved in an event as opposed to just using advertising,&rdquo; adds Khalap.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">That is exactly what Pepsi did at the NH7 Weekender, when it sponsored a new stage called Pepsi Dub Station that was dedicated to sounds like dubstep dance, drum and bass and reggae, which are considered the future of dance music internationally. It was a targeted association and fit perfectly with Pepsi&rsquo;s youth-oriented brand positioning. Points out Sandeep Singh Arora, executive vice-president, marketing (cola), PepsiCo India, &ldquo;This association reflects our strategy of creating new trends, reflecting youth passions and giving voice to the youth&rsquo;s point of view.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>The music&rsquo;s just started</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Globally, live music festivals are considered to be a multi-billion dollar industry. Events like the Coachella Valley music and art festival in Southern California (which has unannounced performances from top hip-hop artists like Kanye West), Roskilde in Denmark, Sound Wave in Perth and T in the Park in Scotland are some of the oldest and biggest music festivals, which see staggering crowds of up to a quarter of a million.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6">Not surprisingly, they invite massive corporate interest. At Roskilde 2011, for instance, brands like Tuborg, Bosch, Lays, Microsoft, Converse, Diesel, Nikon and Tetrapak were associated with the event. Others like Coachella and T in the Park have Heineken beer, H&amp;M, Play Station, Red Bull and BBC regularly associating with them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Live music events in India have a long way to go. They have not raised that level of interest &mdash; yet. But Deepinder Goyal, founder CEO of zomato.com, an online event information, restaurant guide and ticketing platform, says there is a rising demand for such events. &ldquo;More than 2 million people visit our event information pages every month and the majority is looking out for such events,&rdquo; he says.

(472, 16, '', 'The new heavyweight', '<p class="p1">Anirudh Bhuwalka would have gone into the realty, software or entertainment business but for an uncle with a serendipitous idea: trucks. In 2004, &lsquo;uncle&rsquo; Shashi Ruia, head of the $17-billion Essar Group, had just forayed into highway construction and ordered expensive Volvo trucks. &ldquo;Why not make such trucks in India?&rdquo; he wondered. &ldquo;After all, what does it take to make a truck? An engine, a gear box, an axle &mdash; just put them together and you have a truck!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Bhuwalka did just that. He launched Asia MotorWorks (AMW) to manufacture commercial vehicles (CVs): the first prototypes rolled out in 2005. When commercial rollout happened three years later, the trucks did match Ruia&rsquo;s definition, but with a little extra thrown in. The result: the newbie AMW has a 5% share of the HCV market (<em>see: The highway stars</em>) and Bhuwalka is heading what seems set to become a billion-dollar company.</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>The highway stars - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">In the commercial vehicle (CV) market dominated by heavyweights like Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland, followed by worthies like Eicher, Volvo and M&amp;M, AMW&rsquo;s rapid growth has generated intense curiosity about the young gun who dared. How come he was selling jazzed-up new trucks in bright colours almost overnight? Were they Chinese? Since they were not, it was assumed Ruia was hand-holding his nephew. Not surprisingly, perhaps, the 36-year-old Bhuwalka denies it. &ldquo;The Essar Group has no role to play in AMW,&rdquo; he says peaceably. &ldquo;But I look upon my uncle as my mentor and credit him with giving me the idea of getting into this business.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">He clarifies that Ruia put some money into his company during the initial years, provided space in Hazira to develop AMW&rsquo;s first few prototypes before the official launch in 2008, and bought some of the first trucks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It is not easy manufacturing trucks, after all even a small car like the Tata Nano has 40 patented components. Essentially, every roadworthy vehicle requires engines that take years to test and develop, efficient gear boxes, axles that can take Indian roads, and hundreds of other crucial components, all of which have to be put together, tested and re-tested before they can be sold commercially.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Bhuwalka&rsquo;s answer to all these dilemmas was to actually implement Ruia&rsquo;s simplified approach to truck-making. He outsourced and integrated components from around 190 suppliers to make his trucks: Cummins engines, ZF/ Eaton gear boxes and Meritor axles. He relied on localised components rather than imports. AMW is Eaton&rsquo;s anchor customer and the reason why the fully-synchronised gearbox maker has set up shop in India. &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t have stood a fighting chance if we had relied on an imported components-driven strategy, or by spending millions to make some of the components,&rdquo; Bhuwalka says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">If Nano&rsquo;s uniqueness lies in the way it broke the price barrier, AMW proved that price is not everything. &ldquo;The idea was to give a value proposition to the customer by transforming the product and the service delivery,&rdquo; Bhuwalka says. In the process, he has filled a niche that had been vacant for decades and delivered a product that suited fleet owners very well. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Green signalled</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">An Icra report on the Indian CV (small, light, medium, heavy) industry notes its fairly duopolistic character &mdash; for many years, Tata Motors alone has led with 50-60% market share; Ashok Leyland is the other consistent market leader. This market structure presents two scenarios: firstly, incumbents are under no pressure to differentiate products or change them to suit different needs (if A doesn&rsquo;t change, B won&rsquo;t either, or B will change if A changes) and, secondly, it allows new entrants opportunities to offer distinct products with more value on the table, albeit at a slightly higher price.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;Not so long ago, the Indian CV industry had only two or three players while most of the other countries have many more,&rdquo; says Vinod Dasari, MD, Ashok Leyland. &ldquo;India is a big market with opportunities for other players to come in. Therefore, in the last few years, the number of serious players has gone up to seven. Each company has developed its own strategy to tap the domestic CV market.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Shashi Ruia was right. The trick for AMW was to have a specialised product line that offered Volvo&rsquo;s features for the price of a Tata or Leyland truck. AMW at present makes HCVs (16 to 49 tonnes), a $7 billion market, catering to high-growth sectors like construction and mining. &ldquo;In these specialised areas of work, you can&rsquo;t really use the same truck that ferries chicken,&rdquo; says Nipun Kaushal, vice-president, branding, AMW.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Four more things about AMW trucks caught customer attention: the increased engine capacity of up to a maximum of 270 hp (as against 180 hp); a 9-speed gear box (instead of the usual 6-speed); a totally built body instead of a bare chassis; and, very importantly, totally revamped cabin space with air-conditioning and proper sleeping bunks for drivers to rest. An AMW truck with all these features costs only about 5% more ($40,000 instead of $35,000 for traditional trucks with bodies built up).</p>\n<p class="p3">Industry veterans believe that that may well be the way forward. The higher torque, horse power and greater comfort in the cabin add up to greater earning potential for the truck operator, which, in turn, can reduce the payback period for the vehicle. &ldquo;A higher horse power and more carrying space allow us to carry more load on the same trip,&rdquo; says Girish Bharadwaj, who owns a fleet of a dozen trucks in Faridabad. &ldquo;Air-conditioning reduces driver fatigue and enables more trips in the long run. A built-up body means the truck can be put to business from day one.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Of course, AMW is no longer the only player in offering bells-and-whistles variants of utilitarian trucks &mdash; other players in the commercial vehicles sector, such as Volvo-Eicher, Force-MAN, Scania and Hino, are eyeing this market hungrily. Bharat Benz will be here soon and Mahindra has launched even more powerful, GPS-enabled trucks in collaboration with Navistar. At first glance, Mahindra Navistar&rsquo;s strategy seems to mirror that of AMW. But Nalin Mehta, managing director, Mahindra Navistar, says, &ldquo;We are not catering to a niche segment but cater to the mass market with highly upgraded features that allow fleet owners to use their vehicles even more efficiently.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Four years young</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Bhuwalka says he relies more on the business instincts that run in his genes. &ldquo;In the beginning, we didn&rsquo;t have any grand plans,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Before we experimented in Essar&rsquo;s Hazira complex, AMW was a garage enterprise operating out of Nashik. We took up the challenge one day at a time and never looked too far ahead, making 20 prototypes before the launch.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Today, AMW&rsquo;s manufacturing base in Bhuj can roll out 50,000 trucks annually. And from 2,300 trucks in 2008, AMW will roll out over 12,000 trucks in 2011-12 (<em>see: Zipping ahead</em>). The focus now is on first sweating the assets and striving towards the &ldquo;magic number&rdquo; of the potential 50,000. While the company will continue to service the medium and HCV segments of the market in the short to medium term, the aim is to establish AMW&rsquo;s presence across all segments of the CV market. It has already launched a related line of customised trailers and truck bodies under the Tranztar brand name. There are no current plans to go public.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Zipping ahead - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Bhuwalka does not talk numbers, only saying Rs 700 crore has been pumped into AMW both as debt and equity. AMW recorded operating revenues (stand alone) of Rs 1,185 crore for the nine-month period ending March 2011. But it made a net loss (from continuing operations) of Rs 37 crore. In the previous 15-month period, it recorded a loss of Rs 58 crore on a total Rs 1,078 crore.</p>\n<p class="p3">The brightly coloured trucks and air-conditioned cabins may be a hit with long-haul drivers, but it&rsquo;s not been a bump-free ride for AMW. Its launch coincided with the global slowdown, which impacted CV sales in India as well (there was a 38% drop in HCV sales between 2007 and 2008). While sales have picked up again, customers do have a reservation or two about AMW, mainly on the resale value and the cost and availability of spares. The company&rsquo;s response? It already has 85 service centres across the country besides fully- loaded service centres that operate out of freight containers in remote locations such as work sites in, say, Sikkim. (In comparison, Ashok Leyland has 375 touch points for service and parts support, apart from 5,000 authorised outlets for parts.)</p>\n<p class="p3">Meanwhile, CV manufacturers are upbeat about the prospects for the industry, the current dip in GDP numbers notwithstanding. &ldquo;There is going to be a lot of growth in the CV segment, which will spread across all segments of the industry,&rdquo; says Ashok Leyland&rsquo;s Dasari. Mahindra Navistar&rsquo;s Mehta says, &ldquo;I expect 8-9% growth in the CV industry, driven by construction activities, growth in the agriculture sector and consumption in non-urban centres. Interest rates heading south will only make it easier to buy CVs.&rdquo; The question is, are interest rates really turning and can the economy deliver sufficient growth to spur demand for new CVs? After the drop in 2008, sales in the next two years took off. Now, though, offtake has settled at a more subdued 12%-odd.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Revving up sales clearly looks to be a challenge for truck manufacturers in the coming year or two. But on the positive side, Mehta feels the wide range of new vehicles that are being launched gives fleet owners more options when he sets out to buy replacements, which will, in turn, ensure growth in the CVs industry. &ldquo;There will be players who will be meeting very specific requirements of the user industry,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;What happened in the car industry 10 years back is now going to happen for the next 10 years in the commercial vehicle industry.&rdquo; Bhuwalka must be congratulating himself for listening to his uncle&rsquo;s advice.&nbsp;</p>', 'AMW''s multi-featured trucks have driven smoothly into success but there could be speed breakers ahead ', '24', '', 0, '', 'the-new-heavyweight-472', 466, 1, 0, 0, 16, 'The new heavyweight ', 'AMW''s multi-featured trucks have driven smoothly into success but there could be speed breakers ahead ', '', '', '', 'Asia MotorWorks,Essar Group', 0, NULL, '2015-02-09 16:09:04', '2015-02-09 16:23:57', '2012-02-04', 0),
(473, 16, '', 'Networking a way out', '<p class="p1">Couched comfortably in his leather bean bag at his plush, South Mumbai office, the former head of a leading television channel scrolls down innumerable analyst reports on the recent Reliance-TV18 deal on his iPad and declares that it is Mukesh Ambani who will now call the shots at the Rs 2,500-crore Network18. &ldquo;Ambani has pulled off a huge coup,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">But you won&rsquo;t hear Raghav Bahl complaining. The promoter of Network18 has smartly, and at a very opportune time, wriggled out of&nbsp;the financial troubles of the group, only to integrate Ambani&rsquo;s other media property that has only been on a losing streak ever since the Reliance Industries chief&nbsp; bought that stake for considerations other than purely commercial.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">For the uninitiated, TV18 has recently acquired a partial stake in the television business of the Hyderabad-based Eenadu, for Rs 2,100 crore, from Reliance Industries, which had invested in the company back in 2008 for Rs 2,600 crore. TV18 will acquire a 100% stake in the five regional news channels of ETV (ETV MP, ETV UP, ETV Bihar, ETV Urdu and ETV Rajasthan), where Reliance has a 100% stake. It will also acquire a 50% stake in Eenadu&rsquo;s five regional entertainment channels (Marathi, Bengali, Kannada, Oriya and Gujarati), where Reliance owns a 100% stake. Further, it will acquire a 25.4% in ETV Telugu and ETV Telugu News, where Reliance currently owns a 49% stake (the remaining 51% is with Eenadu promoter Ramoji Rao).</p>\n<p class="p3">Now comes the tricky part. While Reliance is selling part of its stake in Eenadu to TV18, Reliance itself is funding the debt-ridden TV18&rsquo;s bid to fulfill its regional ambitions. TV18 plans to fund this acquisition through a rights issue, where TV18 and the holding company, Network18, plans to raise Rs 2,700 crore each. By this, the company should be able raise roughly Rs 4,000 crore (assuming the rights issue isn&rsquo;t fully subscribed). Reliance Industries will fund the promoters for the rights issue through a trust called Independent Media Trust, in the form of optionally convertible bonds. Reliance will also infuse Rs 1,700 crore into Network18.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">It&rsquo;s highly unlikely that Ambani won&rsquo;t have a larger game plan in mind considering he&rsquo;s sinking such a huge sum into the media house, albeit indirectly. As for Bahl, his innings is coming to an end, industry observers reckon. In FY11, TV18 had posted a loss of Rs 70 crore and debt of around Rs 1,400 crore on a topline of Rs 2,500 crore. Sure, it will use some of the money raised through this labyrinthine deal to repay some debt, but it ends up with an expensive asset on which it won&rsquo;t be easy to make money for many years. &ldquo;This is a prime example of destruction of shareholder value,&rdquo; says the unnamed media veteran. He wonders if Bahl holds more than 10% share in the company, although on paper he still owns the majority stake.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>"This is a marriage of convenience between an ugly bride an a physically challenegd groom" - Peter Mukerjea, former CEO, Star India</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Former Star India CEO Peter Mukerjea, who is now a mentor to several cross-media professionals, calls the deal a marriage of convenience between an ugly bride and a physically challenged groom. &ldquo;One was deep in debt and needed to get cash into the business quickly and the other was sitting on an asset they purchased some years ago but were not able to monetise. Structuring the deal this way provides an escape hatch for both. I guess they both will live happily ever after &mdash; or will they?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Losing the plot - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">The &ldquo;ugly bride&rdquo; here is obviously Eenadu. According to an IDFC report, Ushodaya Enterprises, the holding company of Eenadu Network, has posted a loss of Rs 60 crore in 2010-11. None of the 12 channels of the network is doing well; even ETV Telugu and ETV Telugu News, the flagship channels, are a distant No.3 and No.5 in their respective genres with channel shares of&nbsp; 19.9% and 9.2%, respectively. In contrast, market leader Gemini TV has a 40.3% share in the Telugu entertainment genre, while TV9 Telugu is the leader in the news genre with 20.7% market share, according to TAM Media Research (<em>See: Losing the plot</em>).</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Larger game plan?</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">RIL&rsquo;s argument is that this deal will allow its proposed 4G platform access to quality content from this huge network of 22 channels (post the Eenadu acquisition; Network18 originally had nine channels). But that&rsquo;s a tad too simplistic. After all, RIL needed to only buy content, not the content provider.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">While no one seems to doubt that Ambani has a larger agenda, there&rsquo;s no official information &mdash; or consensus in conjecture &mdash; on what it could be. Meanwhile, theories abound. Ambani&rsquo;s reviving his media ambitions (which, along with Reliance-owned newspaper <em>Sunday Observer</em>, had been discarded in the 1990s) and RIL will use these channels as its personal PR platform, goes one school of thought. A former CEO of a leading media buying agency sees this investment as a larger strategy in preparation for the elections. Ambani&rsquo;s pro-Congress leanings are well known. &ldquo;If you have a consolidation of networks supporting you when elections are round the corner, it helps,&rdquo; he points out. That idea dovetails nicely with another possibility: that RIL&rsquo;s come on board Network18 to further build its clout with the government. &ldquo;No government can afford to antagonise a media house that owns such powerful channels,&rdquo; says Ashutosh, COO, CellCast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Mukerjea sticks his neck out a little more, suggesting Ambani&rsquo;s bought the business for his children, since media is a &ldquo;cool&rdquo; business for the younger generation. &ldquo;What better present for the young scion to inherit and then, over time, to combine the cricket team and the sports management interests and, perhaps, even Anil Ambani&rsquo;s TV channels and radio stations.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a scary thought, especially for those in the business.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>An overpriced deal&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Ambani&rsquo;s motivations aside, what prompted TV18 to pay a staggering Rs 2,100 crore for a partial stake in Eenadu when the company&rsquo;s total revenue last year was just Rs 525 crore? And this when Bahl is believed to have trashed a similar proposal in 2010, saying Rs 2,500 crore for the entire company was unviable. &ldquo;He agreed to this current deal only because it was an equity swap,&rdquo; says a Network18 insider. Bahl&rsquo;s ambitions of a huge network of channels, with considerable presence in the regional category, is well known. But given its precarious finances, such a huge payout for a bouquet of regional channels that aren&rsquo;t performing too well is unfathomable. Indeed, until the deal with RIL, Bahl had been treading cautiously, even shelving plans of launching some channels under Viacom18 (a 50:50 JV between Network18 and Viacom), such as the movie channel. In fact, since the channel didn&rsquo;t take off, Viacom18 is known to have sold its movie library to Star India, for Rs 500 crore.</p>\n<p class="p3">As <em>Outlook Business </em>went to print, TV18 was known to be in talks with Viacom to buy out the remaining 50% of Ambani&rsquo;s stake in Eenadu&rsquo;s entertainment business. &ldquo;However, Viacom is not very keen on picking up the stake as it is over-priced,&rdquo; reveals a former employee of Viacom.</p>\n<p class="p4">&nbsp;<strong>A daunting task</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">According to a report by IDFC, the regional broadcasting industry is pegged at Rs 3,000 crore (including Tamil Nadu, where Eenadu doesn&rsquo;t have a presence). Eenadu operates in a particularly cluttered environment, with five to six channels in each genre. Eenadu ranks third or fourth in most markets. Under such circumstances, points out the report, the competitive intensity for each player would be, at best, a market share of 15-20%. So, it concludes, the opportunity size for ETV will be nothing more than Rs 600 crore. &ldquo;For TV18 shareholders to generate an optimal RoE of 15% from the transaction in the next five years, ETV Network would need to garner a net profit of Rs 550 crore plus (equal to its revenues today). Against this backdrop, we believe it will be extremely challenging to justify the economic merit of this transaction for TV18 shareholders,&rdquo; points out Nikhil Vora, managing director, IDFC.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>"ETV lost its edge on some of its channels. It has to effect a turnaround to earn a decent return on investment" - Sunil Lulla, managing director, Times Television Network</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Sure, the idea behind offering a bouquet of channels is to have a better bargaining power with advertisers. &ldquo;If you have a variety of channels to offer advertisers, you become a network to reckon with,&rdquo; points out Punitha Arumugham, CEO, Madison Media. Advertisers, too, prefer networks if they&rsquo;re seeking a national and regional audience. But this is where ratings become critical &mdash; over 60% of the revenue for regional channels comes from advertising. For instance, in West Bengal, ETV Bangla was No.1 until Star and Zee launched their regional offerings in that market in 2007-08. Now, the channel has slipped to the No.3 position and, consequently, ad rates have dropped around 20% in the last three or four years. This is the case with most of the Eenadu channels. So where Network18 may get advertisers on a standalone channel like Colors (which has some of the highest-rated shows), it may find it tougher to effectively leverage the Eenadu network. &ldquo;The regional markets space has intense competition. In recent times, ETV lost its edge on some of its channels. It has to effect a turnaround to earn a decent return on investment,&rdquo; says Sunil Lulla, managing director, Times Television Network. If Network18 is to monetise the Eenadu network, it will have to invest in improving the content of the channels . That won&rsquo;t come cheap, but with RIL pumping in money, perhaps Network18 will think it worth the effort.</p>\n<p class="p3">Raghav Bahl has had his time in the limelight.

Backed by the strong execution of its projects, Pratibha posted a 19% growth in revenue in H1FY12.&nbsp;Analysts also like the company for its presence in the high-margin water segment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Pratibha&rsquo;s order-book to sales ratio, indicative of its revenue visibility, is one of the highest in the industry (<em>see: Healthy as ever</em>). &ldquo;The current size of order-book will be able to generate revenue for nearly 11-12 quarters,&rdquo; says Suhani Patel, analyst, Networth Stock Broking. &ldquo;Even if there is a slowdown in order inflows, it should not impact the company.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Healthy as ever - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Pratibha makes operating margin of 13-14%, which the company believes it can sustain. &ldquo;We believe we should continue with these margins, given that there is no shift in the nature of the projects we do. Also, 95% of our projects have a price escalation clause, which protects us from commodity price increase,&rdquo; says Katyal. That&rsquo;s another reason why Pratibha is an island of calm in a sector beset by that sinking feeling.</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>Happy year ahead?</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">In FY12, Pratibha expects a 25% year-on-year growth in revenue, backed by the big-ticket projects it has won recently. &ldquo;Work on the Delhi Metro project has already started,&rdquo; Katyal says. &ldquo;We are on schedule (May 2014 completion) and we will recognise about Rs 25-30 crore revenue this quarter (Q4FY12).&rdquo; Pratibha&rsquo;s 80:20 joint venture with China Railway First Group in May 2011 won a Rs 467-crore project to design, engineer and construct two sections of twin underground tunnels for Delhi Metro&rsquo;s phase 3.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The other revenue grosser will be the Rs 1,249-crore Delhi Jal Board project for laying interceptor sewers along three major drains in Delhi to reduce pollution in the Yamuna. Pratibha bagged this contract in July 2011 in a 60:40 partnership with Russia-based Mosinzhstroi Open Joint Stock Co. &ldquo;The entire survey has been completed for Delhi Jal Board and the design portion is also 80% complete,&rdquo; says Katyal, adding that the company should be able to finish design by the end of January. The orders for equipment have been placed and an estimated Rs 15-17 crore in revenue should start flowing in this quarter (Q4FY12).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>Occupational hazard</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Over FY06 to FY11, while revenues saw a 48.8% CAGR, net profit too clocked a healthy CAGR of 42.2%. However, net debt increased from Rs 377 crore in FY11 to Rs 650 crore now. &ldquo;Working capital went up as the company began work on its Delhi Jal Board and Delhi Metro projects,&rdquo; says Teena Virmani, analyst, Kotak Securities. &ldquo;Till the time the projects are executed, working capital may remain high.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Because of stiffer rates, the company&rsquo;s interest expense, as a percentage of operating profit, in H1FY12 was also high at 42%. Katyal says 28-30% of this is bank guarantee charges, letter of credit discount charges and performance guarantees for equipment purchases. &ldquo;This is unavoidable when we take on new projects.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Nevertheless, a key positive for Pratibha is a lower working capital cycle than its peers. The company&rsquo;s debtor days (the ratio that measures how quickly cash is collected from debtors) is 45 days, while its net working capital cycle is 145 days &mdash; which compares very well with the industry average of 200 days. &ldquo;As Pratibha has bagged orders from reputed clients like Tata Housing and state governments like Delhi and Gujarat, there is no delay in payments from clients,&rdquo; says Networth&rsquo;s Patel.</p>\n<p class="p3">Meanwhile, Pratibha is looking at reducing its debt and improving profit margins by offloading its saw pipe manufacturing business, a Rs 120-crore in-house division located at Wada, in Maharashtra. It is used for captive consumption in its water management projects. &ldquo;We have been experiencing an oversupply in saw pipes,&rdquo; says Katyal.&nbsp; &ldquo;As there is a lot of competition and local manufacturers are undercutting us, we want to exit this line of business.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There are a few ways in which Pratibha can do this. It could sell the entire business if it gets a good price, or it could rope in a strategic investor and relocate the plant to a place like Saudi Arabia, where the company is expanding its operations.&nbsp;&ldquo;The division was set up to give us a competitive edge,&rdquo; says Katyal. &ldquo;That purpose has been achieved. Since it&rsquo;s not adding to our EPS any more, we might as well offload it and reduce our debt.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p6"><strong>Well Spread</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Pratibha, which started out as a Maharashtra-centric company, now gets only 40% of its orders from western India, while it gets a good 47-48% from the north, 5% from overseas, and the rest from other geographies in the subcontinent. This diversification is to ensure the company does not depend on any one region for all its orders.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">Apart from executing a Rs 400-crore project for the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, recently, Pratibha set up a subsidiary in Saudi Arabia with a local partner, Al Suwaiket. &ldquo;You cannot have a 100% subsidiary in Saudi Arabia,&rdquo; Katyal explains. Pratibha has a 49% stake in the Saudi company and soon, it is expected to start bidding for projects there.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4">In spite of all this, Pratibha&rsquo;s stock has fallen almost 40% year to date, like its peers in the industry. Kotak&rsquo;s Virmani, who has a price target of Rs 62, says, &ldquo;This is part of the de-rating every infrastructure company has seen.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Possible downsides include a further deterioration in economic growth, policy inertia and the possibility of an elongated working cycle leading to more debt. The sale of the saw pipe division, if and when it goes through, will lead to a one-time pop in the stock. Sustained upward momentum, though, will come only from a consistent rise in its order flows.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Networth Broking has a price target of Rs 53 on Pratibha, while Sushil Finance expects it to be at Rs 48. That presents an upside of 32% and 20% respectively, from the current market price of Rs 40.</p>\n<p class="p3">As the company will continue to benefit from increased government spending on water and urban infrastructure projects, its stock can be bought on dips.&nbsp;</p>', 'Pratibha Industries, with its overflowing order-book in a down-and-out infra sector, makes for a good bet', '30', '', 0, '', 'fully-booked-477', 471, 1, 0, 0, 13, 'Fully booked ', 'Pratibha Industries, with its overflowing order-book in a down-and-out infra sector, makes for a good bet', '', '', '', 'Pratibha Industries,Infrastructure', 0, NULL, '2015-02-09 18:10:48', '2015-03-02 14:31:17', '2012-02-04', 0),

Out of the 50 pending Bills, 80% need to be passed in the Budget session</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li class="p1">I would bring in electoral reforms. State should fund elections and Parliament and Assembly polls should be held together</li>\n<li class="p1">I would focus on reducing income inequality and poverty by teaching people to earn and not wait for handouts</li>\n</ul>\n<p class="p1">Let me tell you what the government needs to do, particularly the Central government. We are a federal structure and just the Central government by itself cannot solve all the problems but I don&rsquo;t think we have the time to talk of state governments, municipal corporations or the <em>gram panchayats</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Coming back to the Central government, I am sorry to say that all the major political parties appear to behave like schoolchildren. The Congress and its allies, the BJP and its allies &mdash; nobody can see eye to eye with anybody. There are, of course, ideological differences also when it comes to the Left. But the UPA and NDA should agree on certain economic and governance policies that are good for the country.</p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There will be issues on which the Congress and the BJP cannot agree. This is understandable. They are, after all, two separate parties in a democracy. So every five years, or whenever the elections take place, they can fight each other.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class="p3">The NDA and UPA together have a majority in the Lok Sabha and in the Rajya Sabha. Today, the UPA does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha on its own, but with the BJP on board it can pass all the Bills without a problem. There are about 30 Bills pending today in the Lok Sabha, and I believe 20 more Bills need to be introduced, taking the total number of Bills that need to be passed to over 50. In the last 12 months, nothing was done. In the 2010 winter session, no Bill was passed. The Budget session essentially passed the Budget and its related Bills.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Coming back to what the government needs to do, in two words, we need &lsquo;Good Governance&rsquo;. And for this, we need at least 70-80% of these 50 Bills to be passed as soon as possible.</p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Then, there must be electoral reforms, apart from the Bills in Parliament for economic and social matters. The UPA and NDA should come together for electoral reforms. Criminals should not come into Parliament. Reforms like state funding of elections should be introduced.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class="p3">Also, the Parliament and Assembly elections should be held simultaneously, that is, there should be no mid-term polls. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Apart from inadequate infrastructure, the two major problems India is facing are poverty and income inequality. Though some political parties on the Left may disagree, I believe that to reduce poverty and inequality, the first pre-requisite is growth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Unless India has at least 9% GDP growth per annum, poverty cannot be reduced. Giving Rs 120 per day for 200 days a year doesn&rsquo;t solve the long term problem. It&rsquo;s not, by and large, productive employment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The poor who take advantage of NREGS cannot be expected to travel 20 km or more for work. If millions of people have to be given jobs wherever they live, it&rsquo;s not much better than digging a well and filling it up, which will take the country to bankruptcy. Some roads are laid under the NREGS, that too with complete inefficiency and corruption.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">With growth in industry, services and agriculture, gainful employment can be generated. That helps growth and it comes from growth. It is the cause and the effect. I think there is no better way to reduce income inequality on a sustainable basis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>As told to Rashmi K Pratap</strong></p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Prahlad Kakkar, Ad Guru</strong></p>\n<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">\n<li class="p1">I would reduce corruption by making everyone do their job well and not wait for someone else to do it for them</li>\n<li class="p1">I would make politicians clean the streets at least once a month to make them feel ownership and responsibility for their constituencies</li>\n<li class="p1">I would de-politicise the police force, so that more cops are available for public safety rather than just VIP duty</li>\n</ul>\n<p class="p1">My Achilles&rsquo; heel is the feeling I have for my country. For many of us it&rsquo;s natural to put our country first, but this is especially important if we are in public view or abroad, because people judge our country through us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">As a leader, my first priority will be justice for all. The process of law has become completely discredited. The last thing one wants to do is go to court. Thanks to the time and money that goes into the judicial process, it is easier to pick up a gun and shoot or slap somebody to vent your frustration.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">What irks me about the system is that everybody expects somebody else to do their job, which is why corruption is such a menace. The only way it can be addressed is to deliver what is expected of each of us without bribing anyone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Today, we are on the edge of a complete breakdown of law. Things have reached a stage where we look toward goons for instant justice &mdash; the D-company, the Shiv Sena, and the MNS are all non-constitutional authorities. Why are so many people turning to extra-constitutional means for justice? It&rsquo;s because the system has let them down. So, a leader&rsquo;s priority will be to make the recourse to law much easier than it is today and to come down hard on people who break the law.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Secondly, we must de-politicise the police force. Right now, the police force is available only for VIP duty. Public safety has been neglected and no action is taken on vandalism. When Mumbai was attacked in 2008 by nine armed terrorists, 15,000 cops with antiquated rifles and a complete lack of training were called in to combat them. If a small, elite commando force had been deployed earlier, we could have saved many lives. Two chief ministers and two scams later, nothing has changed for the ordinary man. Does he feel any safer now? That&rsquo;s the question we have to answer today.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class="p3">Why are we talking about terrorism? Terrorism exists in our own people because of the complete breakdown of law and order. The system needs to be overhauled and made people-friendly. This should be made priority. If we can do these two things, they can bring about massive change.</p>\n<p class="p3">Yet another thing that has to change is the <em>mai-baap</em> attitude of the government, where by handing out various subsidies and handouts, they make the people feel like the government is their benefactor, who hands them pocket money. This way you&rsquo;re making them dependent on you and incapable of working independently and thus compelling them to vote you back every time. Look at Lakshadweep. The island&rsquo;s collective annual income is Rs 5-10 crore, but government gives the villagers subsidies to the tune of Rs 350 crore! Upliftment of society has to happen through development, not appeasement. A government has to initiate public spending to create jobs, not for handouts.</p>\n<p class="p3">The last thing that I would love to do is to get every single member of all political parties to come out into the streets and once a month clean them with a <em>jhadoo</em> (broom). This is a symbolic gesture of civic service that can make a civil servant and a political leader feel ownership for the hygiene of a city. Mumbai is, most of the times, an entry point and is showcased as our greatest pride to the world. And all they see is a filthy city that no one takes ownership for.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">If you are part of a larger mission, you must know the world does not end with you &mdash; you are only a tool to achieve that mission. Indeed, a leader is a small but important cog in a huge and fantastic country like ours.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>&mdash;As told to Arundhati Ramanathan</strong></p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Medha Patkar, social activist</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class="s1">I would form a coalition government such that there is a humane bond between leadership and members&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li class="p1">I would ensure that resources are used to fulfil needs in an eco-friendly way</li>\n<li class="p1">I would make sure that companies are in tune with local needs&nbsp;</li>\n<li class="p1">I would bring in a strong Lokpal to root out corruption</li>\n</ul>\n<p class="p1">India. The word fills you with a feeling of belonging, love and commitment. The country&rsquo;s diversity makes you feel elated to be a part of the culture. And it is not just the archaeological and anthropological discovery but the reality that appeals to you and also poses a challenge. Challenge to witness a democratic country with a plan to have everyone&rsquo;s needs fulfilled while the future generations, too, are left with ample resources.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">There is no doubt, however, that the nation needs leadership. One can&rsquo;t think of a single leader capable of guiding the nation. If I am part of a collective leadership, we can&rsquo;t ignore the contribution of the millions who help in maintaining peace or producing goods, providing services, even governing communities themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Today, the State through its pillars, the legislature and executive, is not representing the majority of our people, the farmers, labourers, fishermen, artisans and others. Hence, the common man&rsquo;s dreams &mdash; not of castles, but homes; not of high-fly infrastructure, but pathways and roads; not of global universities but value education with quality and equity &mdash; are not reflected in the policies. If I were to take over, the first task would be to make policies in each sector to address the issue of inequity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">We don&rsquo;t need either big corporates from India or abroad, or even international financers like the World Bank to provide basic needs such as primary education if only the government provides the same by raising the education budget from 3-6% to at least 10%.</p>\n<p class="p3">This needs attention to shift from growth to justice. In the power sector, where crises erupt at the drop of a hat, it&rsquo;s easy to aim for minimising transmission and distribution losses as well as using a mix of renewable sources and technologies in localised projects to light communities first. I would nationalise all minerals and take a loss instead of allowing corporates to make massive profits with huge subsidies and higher pricing.</p>\n<p class="p3">For the above, it is necessary to have inclusive planning. I will decentralise the present State system. Should governance be based only on rule of law? There will have to be rule of values and principles. Human is above legal. If I am to guide the country, I surely will pay more attention to people&rsquo;s empowerment and self reliance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Corruption is the most critical factor today affecting the government and society. That has to be removed. Misappropriation of land, minerals, water and power leading to vulgar profits for builders and investors will be challenged by bringing in bodies such as the Jan Lokpal. Why talk of democracy if we are to govern a large area of our country with the armed forces with special powers? A political dialogue with militants and phasing out of the army from the North East and J&amp;K will be priority. Equally important will be the end of caste politics, religion (beyond personal), gender and region as factors dividing society.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>', 'The political leadership has been facing a crisis of late.

Twelve years into his term, Raju&rsquo;s good conduct earned him a move to the &lsquo;open jail&rsquo; (where convicts are not kept behind bars), where 55 prisoners like him cultivate rice, vegetables, fruits and medicinal plants. Raju earns up to Rs 4,000 a month.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">The prison project is a part of Bangalore-based Himalaya Drug&rsquo;s backward integration programme. While the land belongs to the jail and the produce is sold in the open market, Himalaya provides seeds and training to batches of 10-12 prisoners at a time who grow herbs on a 3-acre stretch. It also picks up their produce at the market price and supports convicts who cultivate medicinal herbs after release.</p>\n<p class="p5">&ldquo;Now that Himalaya is offering an income of Rs 50,000 a year for every acre of land, I will be happy to grow medicinal plants after I am released,&rdquo; says T Swamy, another convict serving a life-term, while offering us tender coconut with a grin. Swamy&rsquo;s family grows sugarcane, paddy and vegetables on a 3-acre plot in Mysore, which fetches them Rs 3,000 a month.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">The Rs 1,200-crore Ayurvedic health-and-personal-care products enterprise has been working on this initiative for the last six months. Himalaya is likely to start a similar project in jails across Andhra Pradesh. The company has already sourced close to 200 quintals of alfa-alfa (a key ingredient of its flagship formulation Liv-52 for animals) from the open jail in Bangalore.</p>\n<p class="p5">Apart from the prisoners, 4,000 independent contract farmers and five NGOs receive Himalaya&rsquo;s support to grow and sell medicinal herbs to the company. Forty-year-old Shiva Kumar, for instance, has been growing medicinal plants such as <em>tulsi</em> and alfa-alfa on his 3.5-acre plot in Tumkur, Karnataka, since 2001. &ldquo;The returns are assured and there is no middleman involved,&rdquo; says Kumar, who was earlier growing <em>jowar</em>. In the last 10 years, he has sold more than 2.5 tonnes of medicinal herbs to Himalaya.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">Himalaya is also partnering with a dozen NGOs who work with poor farmers along the same lines. For instance, the Madurai-based Foundation for Revitalisation of Local Health Traditions, which runs a for-profit farmer organisation called Gram Mooligai (GMCL), collaborates with Himalaya to work with nearly 200 farmers in the cultivation of six varieties of herbs. &ldquo;We have supplied more than 400 metric tonnes of herbs to Himalaya,&rdquo; says Muthu Velayuthum, MD, GMCL.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">In another effort, Himalaya is working with Guwahati-based Aranyak, an NGO involved in conserving wildlife habitat and ecology, to identify eight varieties of endangered medicinal herbs found in the North East. The next step will be to see whether their cultivation is feasible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5">On the face it, all of these are no doubt stellar, socially responsible endeavours, but they are also part of a clear-cut business strategy &mdash; Himalaya procures more than 45% of its raw materials via contract farming and has set itself a deadline of increasing that figure to 70% by 2015. Ravi Prasad, executive chairman and CEO, Himalaya Drug, calls them &lsquo;business social-responsibility&rsquo; initiatives. &ldquo;We have made farmers stakeholders in our business so that both of us are committed to each other,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I find this a far more effective way to run a CSR programme because I feel a corporate will stay committed to a cause only if it&rsquo;s embedded into its business model.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p7"><strong>Trouble at source</strong></p>\n<p class="p4">Though Himalaya has been sourcing its Ayurvedic ingredients from local farmers since the 1930s, the company has been extremely serious about backward integration since 2005. It was poor quality that forced Himalaya to rethink its sourcing from the open market. &ldquo;We had to reject herbs we bought from the open market on numerous occasions,&rdquo; says Dr Rangesh, head, drug discovery and R&amp;D, citing the example of turmeric and <em>neem </em>cultivated on land heavily contaminated with microbes.</p>\n<p class="p5">While self-sourcing has not been a cakewalk, additionally, ever since the company started sourcing ingredients on its own in the last six years, its agricultural raw material costs have gone up by as much as 20% (cost of non-agricultural raw materials increased by 5-8% in the same period). &ldquo;Our costs have gone up but we are assured of good quality and we are also able to support poor farmers across the country,&rdquo; says Prasad, whalso points to Himalaya&rsquo;s affordable Ayurveda philosophy since the company&rsquo;s inception. &ldquo;We have absorbed the additional costs and have managed to do so only because we are a privately-held company. We run the company on internal accruals so we are free from quarterly presentations.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p5">Now, Prasad&rsquo;s aspirations are for something quite ambitious. &ldquo;I want to see Himalaya products in every household across the world,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If that happens, the journey will be fulfilled.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>', 'Himalaya sources rare herbs from contract farmers, NGOs and, yes, jailed convicts', '39', '', 0, '', 'reaping-what-they-sow-479', 473, 1, 0, 0, 13, 'Reaping what they sow ', 'Himalaya sources rare herbs from contract farmers, NGOs and, yes, jailed convicts', '', '', '', 'Himalaya Drug,Contract farming', 0, NULL, '2015-02-10 14:28:18', '2015-03-02 14:30:32', '2012-02-04', 0),

Because even at 90, the chairman of Leela Hotels, not only has the energy of a man less than half his age, but also the cheerful enthusiasm and optimism that most people forget by the time they are nine. We meet at the Royal Club, New Delhi, the Leela&rsquo;s new property. Nair extricates himself from a meeting of the top brass of the hotel including Dinesh Nair, his son, and Rajiv Kaul, vice chairman, the more public face of the group. We sit down to tea and with the murmur of hospitality industry strategy, including how to attract the 1.5 million Russian tourists, buzzing behind us, get talking.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Though the Leela Group, which Nair started at 66, is the most visible of his enterprises, he spent most of his working life building a garment and textile business. Amid the gloom of slowing growth and corrupt governments, Nair is still optimistic. &ldquo;We have some problems. We haven&rsquo;t grown at the pace we should have. But the future is bright.

The morning&rsquo;s papers quote the head of a large Indian conglomerate saying he is forced to look outside India to invest in new businesses. &ldquo;How can you say that? You may be a businessman, but shouldn&rsquo;t you be a patriot first?&rdquo; he asks.</p>\n<p class="p3">This is a running theme of Nair-think, an unquestioning loyalty to his nation. Perhaps this is because he was a military man until he got married and his wife Leela suggested he quit a job that largely involved saluting people. His father-in-law was a large textile manufacturer and Nair began marketing textiles. He set up his own manufacturing units later.

(482, 22, '', 'Pop the bubbly', '<p class="p1">ost of us don&rsquo;t really like champagne and maybe the reason has nothing to do with our obsession with whisky. Even before economic reforms, champagne was associated with celebrations, but the bubbly we got was of uncertain vintage that had been indifferently stored, so chances were that it was spoilt, or very nearly spoilt, when it was popped. Men were mostly happy to pass on the whole roses-and-champagne thing as a woman&rsquo;s drink, and the women who found the taste not to their liking didn&rsquo;t know any better since there were no trained bar attendants to guide them on champagne drinking.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Part of the problem was the lack of availability of champagne in the market. Bottles were smuggled or did double-duty as gifts, so they were circulated between various homes until somebody would open one, with the attendant bad press.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">And yet, there&rsquo;s nothing as refreshing and joyful as a flute of champagne. There&rsquo;s a candour to the wine that is a result of the bubbles, a sense of <em>joie de vivre</em> that the first sip provides, the palate opening up as it teases its way across the mouth. Even whisky drinkers appreciate that it at least makes a pleasing aperitif and an appreciation of champagne has led to increasing sales and a maturing palate that can distinguish between a superior or inferior <em>cru</em>, or vintage, or storage and service.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Still, a couple of decades and several brands later, are things different? I have to concede that champagne drinking remains iffy. We are pleased when waiters at parties balance trays with glasses of champagne as a welcome drink. But champagne is undrinkable for some of the same reasons as earlier. While our palates might have become more discerning, the storage and service of champagne remains dismal.</p>\n<p class="p2">People who serve champagne at parties prefer to buy it from their bootlegger, as a result they have little choice over vintages, and even less about the way it has been stored. Champagne that&rsquo;s been open for a while becomes tepid and loses its effervescence, making its mass serving a travesty.</p>\n<p class="p2">Should champagne be served en masse at parties? I suppose there will always be hosts who wish to impress, but to my mind it is a disgrace to the beverage. Champagne is an intimate alcohol that deserves to be served only in a personalised manner. What might appear to be fussy accoutrements are intended to ensure that the champagne experience turns into a rewarding one. Which is why it is important that the champagne is placed with a slight tilt in an ice bucket, not just to keep it cool but to trap the bubbles from slipping out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Hosts order champagne the way they&rsquo;re ordering everything else &mdash; without bothering to read the labels. So it is inevitable that hotels or caterers will push the stocks of those champagnes that are past their sell-by date. The myth that the older a wine or champagne, the better it is, needs to be exploded. Certain vintages keep better than others, and some need to be consumed while they&rsquo;re still young. A particular fad is serving pink champagne &mdash; but just the colour isn&rsquo;t sufficient to guarantee quality. And, flutes do nothing for pink champagnes which must be served in the wider glass that was shaped &mdash; so an apocryphal tale has it &mdash; according to the shape of Napoleon&rsquo;s mistress&rsquo; breasts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>&mdash;Kishore Singh is a delhi-based&nbsp;writer and curator</strong></p>', 'There are several good reasons why champagne should remain an intimate, special occasion drink ', '17', '', 0, '', 'pop-the-bubbly-482', 476, 1, 0, 0, 13, 'Pop the bubbly ', 'There are several good reasons why champagne should remain an intimate, special occasion drink ', '', '', '', 'Champagne,The bubbly,Pink champagne', 0, NULL, '2015-02-10 16:00:32', '2015-03-02 14:46:06', '2012-02-04', 0),
(483, 24, '', 'Dude, where''s the TV?', '<p class="p1">D<em>on 2</em>, released a few weeks ago, typifies the current flavour of Bollywood films. The hero (Shah Rukh Khan) does not shy away from being the anti-hero, driving fast cars, indulging in crime, alcohol and smoking. Today&rsquo;s heroes are shown in foreign locales, living in mansions and cheating to get ahead in life &mdash; a far cry from the deeply socialist breed of films in the 1950s and 1960s, from <em>Awaara</em> and <em>Shree </em>420 to <em>Pyasaa</em>, which would portray the lead actor as a Robin Hood-like character fighting the corrupt and profiteering <em>seth</em>, <em>thakur, zamindar</em>, mill/ factory/ owner (fearfully or contemptuously called <em>maalik</em> or <em>sarkar</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Does society influence media content or does media influence and shape the society, gender biases and popular culture, is an often hotly-debated topic in any country. We are no different in that respect. Be it films, print, television or advertising, we see a tremendous amount of permeable give-and-take between popular culture and the media and vice versa.</p>\n<p class="p3"><em>Media, Gender, and Popular Culture in India</em> attempts to take on this vast and complex vista to plot media&rsquo;s impact on popular Indian culture and on gender representations and biases. The book appears to have an academic orientation, given the writing style and the elaborate referencing provided at the end of every chapter. In at least one instance, the chapters are revised versions of articles written by the authors that have appeared earlier. Chapter 3, titled &lsquo;Filming Change, Securing Tradition&rsquo; in this book, is a revised version of &lsquo;Missed Opportunity&rsquo; that had <br /> appeared in <em>The Sunday Statesman </em>in March 2008.</p>\n<p class="p3">While the topic is very interesting and extremely wide, the challenge in such an area of writing is that the author needs to very clearly identify trends, patterns and then present generalisations of observations. And those generalisations need to be presented in ways that make the entire landscape come alive on the canvas. This is where the book is a little weak and less than gripping. While the chapter on films delves into Bollywood and Bengali cinema, one would have liked to see the trends and patterns articulated with more vivid presentation or narrative. This is especially true in the case of the chapter on television, which appears to have been given merely lip-service.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Just like Indian cinema, television has had a deep impact on gender portrayal as well as popular culture, right from the days of <em>Ramayan</em>, <em>Nukkad</em> and <em>Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi</em> (all on Doordarshan), <em>Antakshari</em>, <em>Hasratein</em> and <em>Amaanat</em> on Zee, to <em>KBC</em> and <em>Kyunkii</em> <em>Saas Bhi&hellip;</em>on Star Plus and, now, <em>Uttaran</em> and <em>Balika Vadhu </em>on Colors, not to mention scores of Tamil cult dramas. This book has missed a trick or two in relating the TV journey of the last 30 years (ever since Asiad &rsquo;82), which has permeated deep into the cultural and societal orientations of our society.</p>\n<p class="p3">Having said that, the book has in detail captured trends in print, films and advertising. These are supported with fairly rich referencing from articles and journals throughout. The thesis that the authors want to relate is captured in the concluding chapter &mdash; &ldquo;Media has assumed such a major role because it is going through an extraordinary change, a sort of metamorphosis in the last couple of decades.&rdquo; Perhaps more than the general reader, <em>Media, Gender</em>&hellip; will be of more interest and use to students, especially those studying arts or mass communication.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Insights</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p3"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Change of prayers</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1">If you don&rsquo;t like one charity, substitute it with another.

The sex-abuse cases seems to have affected the sensibilities of many Catholics, who simply stopped giving to the church. According to <strong>Dan M Hungerman</strong> of the <strong>National Bureau of Economic Research</strong> (<strong>NBER</strong>), the sex-abuse scandal generated over $3 billion in donations to non-Catholic faiths and a 2-million-member fall in the Catholic population. As a result, many conventional theories have been challenged by these results, suggesting that shocks and policies that focus on one religious group can have spillover effects in other religious groups. However, the negative effect of the scandal in the Catholic church did not lead to an overall decrease in religious participation.</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>Title:</strong>&nbsp;NBER Working Paper No. 17589</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>Source:</strong>&nbsp;National Bureau of Economic Research</p>\n<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>School for CEOs</strong></span></p>\n<p class="p1">The early experiences of a manager affect his career and working style later in life.

Have good internal communication and feedback processes. Make decision-making participative and create opportunities for people to grow. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Full potential:</strong>&nbsp;Allowing people to take up challenging assignments shows faith in their abilities and gives them the opportunity to stretch themselves. Employees should be encouraged to work on cross-functional assignments, allowing them to build diverse skill sets. By exploring more avenues, people find new areas of interest and bring fresh perspectives and energy to the business. &nbsp;For instance, an overseas secondment exposes them to new cultures, working styles and gives global exposure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Engage and empower:</strong> Successful people are a sign of successful organisations. Provide your employees with the best possible working environment &mdash; be it technology tools, a good team, mentors, training programmes or simply the freedom to come up with creative solutions and implement them. Guide them, so they learn from their mistakes. This will equip them to take on bigger challenges in the long run and deliver beyond expectations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Nurture talent:</strong> Understand who your key talent is at various levels, and the level of engagement. Ensure that the right steps are being taken to retain and nurture them to keep the talent pipeline flowing. The challenge is to ensure the right people are in the right place so they are motivated. Have a performance, coaching and development programme for each individual. Also, acknowledging and rewarding those who mentor and coach others sets in motion a culture for this to continue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Develop future leaders:</strong> Identify young, dynamic individuals who are self-driven and willing to shoulder more responsibilities. Also, help them hone their leadership skills and build the emotional intelligence that makes a &lsquo;good leader&rsquo;. Have platforms where these employees get the opportunity to give their recommendations on live issues. These suggestions should be considered by the leadership team and communicated back to give an insight into why the leadership took the decisions it did.

(486, 16, '', 'Trading charges', '<p class="p1">For a company named&nbsp;Lilliput, it certainly made big headlines. In October 2011, newspapers were agog with reports that promoter Sanjeev Narula and private equity majors, Bain Capital and TPG, who had invested in the children&rsquo;s clothing company, were at loggerheads over the soundness of the company&rsquo;s financials. Lilliput isn&rsquo;t the only investor-promoter relationship that&rsquo;s turned sour and the newness of the courtship wasn&rsquo;t the only reason. Cracks have deepened in other seasoned partnerships as well, with some disputes featuring ICICI Venture already in litigation. The most prominent one is perhaps Subhiksha where promoter R Subramanian has filed a Rs 500-crore defamation suit against Wipro chairman Azim Premji whose Zash Investment had bought a 10% stake in Subhiksha from ICICI Venture for Rs 230 crore. Subramanian maintains that Premji&rsquo;s defamatory statements about Subhiksha in a media interview had caused substantial loss of goodwill. The Bombay High Court has asked Premji to file a reply; meanwhile, he continues to nurse his financial wounds, having earlier said that the Subhiksha investment was an &ldquo;error&rdquo;. His efforts at seeking redressal led him to serve a legal notice to Subhiksha board members, which included ICICI Venture representatives as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p1"><strong>Agree to disagree - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Like its part sale of Subhiksha, there is another legacy exit that has come back to haunt ICICI Venture, that of Transafe Services (TSL), a joint venture with Balmer Lawrie. After controlling partner ICICI Venture sold its 71% stake in the JV, the then managing director resigned, too. It was later discovered that the then management had overstated profits considerably over successive years. Since Balmer Lawrie bought ICICI Venture&rsquo;s stake on the basis of an inflated valuation, its last annual report states that it has filed a civil suit in the Calcutta High Court against &ldquo;erstwhile majority shareholders represented by ICICI Venture, seeking relief <em>inter alia</em> to the effect that the sale of shares in TSL to the company by ICICI Venture is void entailing consequent restoration of all advantages derived by each party from the void contract.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class="p3">Not surprisingly, since the issue under discussion was thorny and, in some matters clearly <em>sub judice</em>, none of the parties contacted &mdash; be it ICICI Venture&rsquo;s Vishakha Mulye or Balmer Lawrie managing director Virendra Sinha, Lilliput&rsquo;s Narula, Bain Capital&rsquo;s Amit Chandra or Subhiksha&rsquo;s R Subramanian &mdash; wanted to comment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">And since the parties involved refused to voice their point of view, it is very hard to deduce where the blame should lie and to what extent in each case. However, Satish Mandhana, managing director, IDFC PE, feels that a big deal is being made out of a few stray instances. He says, &ldquo;Barring exceptional circumstances, a PE investor and a promoter&rsquo;s interests are aligned, and in such exceptional cases the courts will decide who actually has to be blamed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Shrinking deal size - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">While there is no denying that in the Indian context, amicable relationship with a promoter is of paramount importance, conflicts are not something that promoters and investors can plan for. PR Srinivasan, founder, Exponentia Capital, says, &ldquo;The dispute is always about bad numbers, either there is underperformance or there is cooking of books. Investors are unlikely to keep quiet if it is the latter.&rdquo; He adds that the management is equally to blame for choosing PE investors on the basis of price rather than choosing investors who have a good understanding of the risk management challenges of the business. &ldquo;Obviously, they start arguing at the first sign of trouble,&rdquo; he concludes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>Top PE deals in 2011 - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">This point about private investors being incompetent at assessing risk is something that Mandhana does not agree with. His take, &ldquo;One needs to see the track record of the fund in other deals as no PE investor would like to indulge in conduct that jeopardises their deal-making ability.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">PE investing is not only about cashing in on opportunities; it is also about profitable exits.

(487, 16, '', 'Keeping it hot', '<p class="p1">Jayaram Banan is a very busy man. He is the quintessential Delhi businessman &mdash; nondescript but glued to his phone and always talking shop. Banan is also the unrivalled <em>dosa</em> king of Delhi. He runs Sagar Ratna, a restaurant that Delhites love to frequent, especially on Sundays, after a long evening of cultural hobnobbing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">Sagar Ratna has come a long way from its beginnings as a quaint 40-seater in a south Delhi residential colony over 25 years ago. The chain now has 67 outlets spread across Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and the NCR. Such is the rise that PE investors have paid Rs 180 crore for a controlling stake in the operation. In 2000, Sagar Ratna&rsquo;s turnover was about Rs 12 crore, which doubled to Rs 25 crore in 2005, and was roughly Rs 70 crore in 2011. The chain makes an impressive 15-20% profit. And all this success has been showcased to the world by a man who was born in a little village called Karkala, 30 km from Udupi. One of seven children, Banan never saw himself living a life in the village. And his ascent to the high flying life of a restaurateur started when Banan failed his school exams, stole some money from his father and ran away to find a life in Mumbai.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Humble beginnings&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">In Mumbai, he landed his first job in a canteen. &ldquo;I washed dishes in the canteen of Hindustan Organic Chemicals,&rdquo; recalls the 54-year-old Banan. His first promotion came within three months of joining the canteen where he was moved up to waiting on tables. Eight years later, Banan quit as night manager to move to the capital, where he started a canteen of his own at Central Electronics in Ghaziabad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2"><strong>Sagar Ratna - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">Banan realised there was an opportunity in food. Delhi was gradually becoming more cosmopolitan and the demand for food to match different palettes was increasing. And in 1986 he started Sagar, renting a shop in Defence Colony for Rs 3,250 a week where he served south Indian staples like <em>idli</em>, <em>dosa</em> and the like. &ldquo;It was very difficult to pay rent but the restaurant picked up really fast,&rdquo; says Banan. Sagar grew. Soon Banan rented adjacent shops and the floors above the restaurant to increase seating capacity. But Delhities couldn&rsquo;t get enough of the &ldquo;Madrasi&rdquo; restaurant and the serpentine queues in Defence Colony continued. In 1991, Banan bought out another popular South Indian eatery, Woodlands. This restaurant was aimed toward the more affluent. Its location (in the famous Lodhi hotel) needed a different ambience than the bare minimum the Defence Colony outlet featured. He invested Rs 50,000 in furniture, increased the prices on the menu card and christened it Sagar Ratna. For a while it seemed the Sagar Ratna juggernaut would continue to roll unhindered.&nbsp; But the 1990s weren&rsquo;t a good time to eat out. The general trend, analysts say, was to eat at home. Restaurants were aggressively expanding but Sagar Ratna bucked the trend and in 1996 it branched out by adopting the franchise model.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>Second wind</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Sagar Ratna&rsquo;s growth story has been in spurts. &ldquo;Most of our 67 restaurants opened during the last decade,&rdquo; reveals K Suresh, CFO, Sagar Ratna. And roughly 60% of the outlets are franchises.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">More than the loosening of control, which helped expansion, what&rsquo;s really helped Sagar Ratna in the past decade is its decision to step out of its comfort zone of vegetarian cuisine to service a broader customer base. In 2001, Banan launched Swagath, which serves coastal and Chettinad cuisine. The restaurant very quickly made it to most lists of best restaurants in the capital. Swagath now has 11 outlets&nbsp; and earned over Rs 30 crore last year (It is run as a separate profit centre under the Sagar Ratna banner).</p>\n<p class="p3">The smell of success reached as far as New York, where it tempted private equity firm India Equity Partners to taste the <em>chutney</em>. In August 2011, IEP shelled out Rs 180 crore for a controlling stake in the food chain. While IEP&rsquo;s Arvind Nair moved in as CEO, Banan has stayed on as chairman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strategic move to improve business and expand to become a pan-India restaurant chain,&rdquo; says Banan of the takeover.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">&ldquo;The brand is powerful. Whatever money Banan got will appear small in five years,&rdquo; says Harminder Sahni, founder and MD, Wazir Advisors. According to a study by Wazir Advisors, in 2009, Sagar Ratna&rsquo;s brand penetration was well below 20% in North India. The potential to expand, therefore, remains tremendous.</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>The secret ingredient</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">But what keeps Sagar Ratna&rsquo;s customers coming back for more? &ldquo;Sagar Ratna is a South Indian restaurant selling authentic food where there are not many South Indian chains,&rdquo; says Sahni. While Chennai veterans like Saravana Bhavan have a few outlets in Central Delhi, they have not been able to challenge Sagar Ratna&rsquo;s domination despite several attempts. That&rsquo;s because, says Sahni, Saravana Bhavan&rsquo;s focus isn&rsquo;t really on North India. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s looking more toward international markets,&rdquo; <br /> he points out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">Meanwhile, Banan continues to rely on his roots, bringing in almost all of the 5,000 strong employee pool &mdash; and not just cooks &mdash; from Mangalore or Tamil Nadu. But it&rsquo;s an advantage that is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. Eateries are notoriously poor paymasters and with increasing industrialisation down south, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s getting more and more difficult to get labour from there,&rdquo; says Banan ruefully.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p4"><strong>And a little more spice</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Sagar Ratna now plans to set up shop in other parts of the country. And that&rsquo;s where it faces another challenge&mdash;it will now have to evolve and change its flavours according to the regional palette. The same <em>sambhar</em> that&rsquo;s a hit with spice-loving Punjabis may not sell in, say, Ahmedabad (where people like it sweet).</p>\n<p class="p3">Further, Sagar Ratna is absent almost everywhere except the North. That&rsquo;s why it might not be able to compete with the likes of Saravana Bhavan in the South and the innumerable Udupi joints in Mumbai, which understand their markets inside out. This is what Sagar Ratna will have to master while it widens its presence. Analysts also argue that the new owners might, in their bid to create a uniform flavour, eliminate the &ldquo;homemade touch&rdquo; from the food. That would be disastrous, as would be any attempt to exchange the &lsquo;family&rsquo; environment for a more sterile corporate environment.</p>\n<p class="p3">&nbsp;But CFO Suresh disagrees. &ldquo;The clauses of agreement ensure win-win situation for both of us. Banan participates in day-to-day business, and there is consultation on daily basis,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class="p3">Banan, meanwhile, is unperturbed. He sees the brand growing to 500 outlets within the next five years. He has won all his battles on his own terms and insists he will continue winning it the same way.

(489, 15, '', 'IT''s new prescription', '<p class="p1">If you undergo an angioplasty in the US, your doctors and hospitals will bill your insurance company using just a single code to describe the cardiac procedure. If you&rsquo;ve sprained your ankle, they could use one of four codes. All that is set to change dramatically in two years. On October 1, 2013, the US healthcare system will mandatorily shift to a newer system of coding through which doctors and hospitals bill insurers. Under ICD-10, as the new system is called, instead of the earlier single code for&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p2">angioplasty, there will be a staggering 1,170 ways of classifying the surgery, depending on the location, the device used and descriptions. There will also be 72 codes for a sprained ankle. The two extra digits in the new system (seven against five currently) will mean significantly more paperwork for American physicians and hospital administrators. For Indian IT companies, though, those two digits mean a $30-billion opportunity.</p>\n<p class="p3">Currently, the US uses the ICD-9 classification, which has been around since 1979. The next revision was ready in the 1990s and about 25 countries around the world have already adopted it. But the US has been dragging its heels, citing high costs, the need for training staff and the complexity of the new codes, and has already deferred one deadline to switch to the new system. Now, with just over two years to go for this government-imposed deadline, the panic to make the transition is building up to a frenzy &mdash; and that&rsquo;s where Indian IT companies come in.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Decoding the new system</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">But first, what is ICD all about? Developed by the World Health Organisation, the International Classification of Disease (ICD) is a standardised framework used across the healthcare industry to compile, report and track diseases and various health conditions. Numeric and alpha-numeric codes cover the diagnosis as well as treatment procedure, so that every health condition is assigned a unique code. ICD-9 comprises over 14,000 diagnosis codes and 13,000 hospital procedure codes. But not only is it outdated, it&rsquo;s also running out of space, so codes for a particular ailment are shifted to other areas that still have room &mdash; some types of heart disease are currently classified in eye treatment codes, for instance.</p>\n<p class="p3">That isn&rsquo;t the only problem. The current system lacks specificity. For example, if a patient is treated for a burn on his right hand, ICD-9 records this only as a burn on the hand. So if he returns some time later with a burn on his left hand, the same code will be reported. That could mean trouble with insurance reimbursement claims since the patient will have to file additional documentation to prove there were two, separate injuries. In the new code, the extra characters will not only identify left from right but also the initial and subsequent encounters, ensuring ease of reimbursement. Not surprisingly, that means a multi-fold increase in the numbers of codes &mdash; 67,000 diagnostic codes and 85,000 hospital procedure codes, to be precise. Indeed, the idea is to have codes for every conceivable ailment, cause and treatment, from the obvious to the bizarre (<em>see: There&rsquo;s a code for that?</em>). &ldquo;Because of the dramatic increase in the number of codes as well as the size of the codes, one-to-one mapping [making the new codes a function of the old] isn&rsquo;t possible,&rdquo; says Amit Shukla, head of sales &amp; client services for US, payer and provider (healthcare) vertical at Wipro Technologies.</p>\n<p class="p3"><strong>There''s a code for that - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p class="p3">That increases the complexity of the conversion but, still, ICD-10 is expected to bring in several benefits to the creaking American healthcare system. Emerging diseases can be incorporated very quickly into the code-set and quality of care is likely to improve, given enhanced data collection. Pradeep Nair, global head and vice-president, life sciences and healthcare, at HCL Technologies, points out another advantage: it will improve the accuracy of payment systems and identify fraud and abuse by more accurately defining services rendered (the US follows a &lsquo;payer&rsquo; model of healthcare where payments are made either by the government or third-party insurance companies).</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>The India advantage</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">There&rsquo;s a lot of work to be done before ICD-10 can roll out onto computer systems across the US. And it involves not just technology, but people and processes as well. People will have to be re-trained to use the new codes, the underlying logic in business processes will have to be re-examined and IT systems will have to be overhauled. &ldquo;The ICD-10 transition involves both business and system changes with financial implications, which cannot be solely addressed through a software code crawling engine,&rdquo; says Eric Paternoster, CEO and director of Infosys&rsquo; Public Services, an American subsidiary of the Bangalore-based IT services firm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">The impact will be felt across the supply side of healthcare. While medical professionals will grapple with the complexity of the new codes, for payers, the impact ranges from processes like claims and eligibility verification, to functions like claim adjudication, underwriting and design of benefits etc. For providers, on the other hand, the new system will lead to changes in how electronic medical records are maintained and management of revenue cycles. That&rsquo;s because initially, there may be an increase in rejection of claims due to incorrect codes although administrative costs will reduce over time since the specificity of codes will mean fewer claims will be sent back <br /> with queries.</p>\n<p class="p3">Not surprisingly, the big healthcare players in the US are turning to India for all their IT requirements and that&rsquo;s where the opportunity lies. HCL Technologies has been chosen by leading healthcare payer United Health as well as Blue Cross and Blue Shield to support their transition to ICD-10. Infosys, Cognizant and Wipro, too, say they have been selected to help major payers and providers in the US make the transition to the <br /> new system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">But the floodgates are yet to open. According to a December 2011 payer market survey by HealthEdge, only 22% of the respondents felt completely prepared for the new coding standard, while 37% said they were only starting to prepare for it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Getting ready</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">How are Indian solution providers preparing? For starters, they&rsquo;re ramping up their healthcare practices &mdash; although companies do not announce headcount numbers for specific industry verticals, revenue growth is a good indicator to capture the shift. And the industry-wise revenue break-up of Indian IT services companies reveals that healthcare is one of the fastest-growing verticals. For the quarter ended December 2011, HCL Technologies saw a 15.9% sequential growth in revenues in its healthcare practice. The growth at TCS and Cognizant: 14.8% and 11%, respectively. Cognizant earns as much as 26% of its total revenues from healthcare, against Wipro&rsquo;s 10%, HCL&rsquo;s 8.4%, TCS&rsquo; 5.3% and Infosys&rsquo; 1.8%. No wonder Vinayambika, senior vice-president of the healthcare practice at Cognizant, is quick to point out, &ldquo;We have been focused on the healthcare space for over 17 years and have deep insights into key events and regulatory directives that impact the US healthcare industry.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">If head-hunters and executive search firms are to be believed, there&rsquo;s a big scramble for talent. However, the search is not for large volumes of entry-level engineers but for experienced people with deep domain expertise. There aren&rsquo;t too many people with prior &lsquo;business experience&rsquo; in the payer and provider market in the US, so companies are falling over themselves to grab whoever they can.</p>\n<p class="p3">Apart from adding people, IT services companies have also built automated tools to make a more compelling proposition. Infosys has a product called iTransform, which is an end-to-end ICD-10 offering that the company claims saves up to 50% of the cost and time to make the transition as compared to the manual process. To sweeten the deal further, Infosys is offering this product as a &lsquo;hosted&rsquo; model, which means that clients don&rsquo;t have to invest huge amounts upfront in building the infrastructure and can simply pay per use.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">HCL Technologies has a tool called iCRM that identifies the financial and business implications of the transition and develops a roadmap to effectively deal with such issues. It also offers services around iCRM to expedite the process of implementing the new code. Similarly, Cognizant has built a T-10 platform, which starts from assessment and goes all the way to implementation. Wipro has also developed tools for the strategy, planning and implementation of the new system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p3">That is not all. Companies are no longer content with just implementation; they are looking to ink end-to-end deals, right from the consulting stage to road-mapping to remediation to testing and finally support. And this is where they hope to play their &lsquo;full-services offering&rsquo; card by displaying competencies in IT consulting, systems integration, testing and support outsourcing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p5"><strong>Not all rosy</strong></p>\n<p class="p2">Will that be enough to succeed? Consultants say more than existing relationships with clients in the healthcare space, what companies need is deep understanding of provider and payer operations, especially with respect to billing systems and codes. &ldquo;This is what poses the biggest challenge to IT companies, since there is a real dearth of people proficient in ICD-10,&rdquo; says an analyst with a global consulting firm.</p>\n<p class="p3">The other worry is the growing clamour in the US for another postponement of the deadline for compliance with the new system. The US is already among the last countries to make the switch from 9 to 10, but now the healthcare industry has a fresh argument. Rather than make the transition to 10, which is already a couple of decades old, why not wait a little longer and be the first to move to ICD-11, they suggest? If that lobbying works, the opportunity for Indian IT may also be pushed back &mdash; and it may well have to encode several thousand more classifications for heart surgery.&nbsp;</p>', '`Indian companies are banking on a new medical billing system in the US', '5', '', 0, '', 'its-new-prescription-489', 483, 1, 0, 0, 13, 'IT''s new prescription ', 'Indian companies are banking on a new medical billing system in the US', '', '', '', 'Medical insurance,International Classification of Disease,HCL Technologies,United Health,Blue Cross,Blue Shield,Infosys,Cognizant,Wipro', 0, NULL, '2015-02-11 13:28:52', '2015-03-02 14:28:22', '2012-02-18', 0),
(490, 14, '', 'Small Wonders', '<p>Remember the recent ad for a &ldquo;caaaaaar&rdquo;?&nbsp;The first glimpse of the RE60 may have had you saying something similar, with a slight change in inflection to: &ldquo;car???????&rdquo; Indeed, Bajaj Auto&rsquo;s new four-wheeler looks more like a child&rsquo;s toy than a vehicle that is supposed to ferry four adults and a driver from point A to point B. But the Pune-based company does not want its new vehicle to be clubbed with the various small cars crowding India&rsquo;s roads or, worse, comparisons with Tata Motors&rsquo; Nano. Indeed, Bajaj Auto is at pains to declare that the RE60 is not a car at all.</p>\n<p>Still, comparisons between the RE60, which was unveiled at the Auto Expo in Delhi last month, and the revamped Nano, which was launched in November, are inevitable. Both are extremely small vehicles, priced to appeal to the common man and by the time they finally hit the roads, had become an uneasy reflection of their company&rsquo;s health. And, although it is early days yet, both seemed poised for a bumpy ride ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>How are the new small wonders of the Indian auto industry going to reach out to their target customers? What different strategies will they adopt? And, most importantly, will they succeed?</p>\n<p><strong>RE60: Auto drive</strong></p>\n<p>Despite all his protests about being &ldquo;anti-car&rdquo;, Bajaj Auto managing director Rajiv Bajaj was expected to showcase a small passenger car at the Auto Expo. What he finally unveiled &mdash; and which had been in the making for nearly five years &mdash; was a souped-up version of the ubiquitous autorickshaw. The RE60 is not a car, Bajaj insisted; it is just a four-wheeeler. Which means it is not even in the same space as the Nano. Instead, Bajaj wants it to replace the fleet of nearly a million autorickshaws across India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whether that happens or not, industry analysts unanimously agree on certain points: the RE60 is not a challenger to the Tata Nano at any level. It will take at least two or three years after its launch for the vehicle to make any significant impact on the company&rsquo;s bottomline. And it is also not an aspirational product that can lift the Bajaj brand in any way.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>No comparison - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p>The RE60 is also a latecomer to the small vehicle party: Tata Motors&rsquo; Iris was launched last year as a four-wheel, four-seater public vehicle. Of course, Bajaj has traditionally been a slow-mover when it comes to new product lines. It continued making geared scooters through the 1990s even as customers moved up to small cars from Maruti and, later, Hyundai. The Pulsar motorcycle, which went on to change the company&rsquo;s fortunes, wasn&rsquo;t launched until end-2001. Even in the three-wheeler segment, which it has dominated for nearly four decades, Bajaj didn&rsquo;t realise the potential for a three-wheeler goods carrier until much later, by which time Piaggio had already captured the category. Tata&rsquo;s Iris has similarly created a new category.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The editor of a leading car magazinecalls the Bajaj RE60 &ldquo;a three-wheeler with four wheels&rdquo;. &ldquo;It is not a huge achievement from an automotive point of view,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Bajaj Auto has been pragmatic. RE60 just goes to show that it is incredibly difficult to get into the passenger car segment. Developing a car is not easy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An auto consultant who was part of the team working on RE60 points out that the original idea <em>was</em> to launch a small car (Rajiv Bajaj&rsquo;s claims notwithstanding). But, he says, &ldquo;The math didn&rsquo;t work out. Getting price points right is not easy.&rdquo; Instead of trying to squeeze out a car on an auto budget (and then selling it dirt cheap, <em>a la</em> the Nano, which overshot its budget several-fold but stuck to the Rs 1 lakh price tag during its launch), Bajaj Auto decided to stay with what it knows best: the rear engine, last mile people carrier.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now that it has finally got the vehicle off the blocks, what will Bajaj do with the RE60? It is the market leader in autorickshaws; won&rsquo;t the RE60 cannibalise its own product? Rajiv Bajaj doesn&rsquo;t think so. He recently told an online management journal that the launch of the four-wheeler is about &ldquo;creating a new category and providing more options.&rdquo; Bajaj did not reply to an email questionnaire sent by <em>Outlook Business</em>.</p>\n<p>Just how welcome will those options be? Anyone who&rsquo;s travelled in an autorickshaw will aver that the vehicle feels like a death-trap on wheels, and exposes passengers and drivers to dust and pollution. However, in many ways, it is also ideal for crowded Indian city roads: it takes up less space, is easily manoeuvred and has a short turning radius.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The lack of those attributes &mdash; and the still unknown maintenance cost of the vehicle &mdash;may be a strike against the RE60 when it comes down to customers&rsquo; purchase decisions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is another very important determinant for RE60&rsquo;s success on the roads: government policies. &ldquo;It is not yet clear whether existing three-wheeler permits will be converted into permits for RE60 [a four-wheeler] or entirely new permits have to be taken,&rdquo; says Shivram Poojary, a Bajaj Auto three-wheeler dealer in Navi Mumbai. Currently, the regional transport offices in cities like Mumbai do not issue any new permits for three-wheelers. Existing permits are traded between drivers for #1 lakh for a five-year period.</p>\n<p>The RE60 will not cost much more than an autorickshaw (expected to be priced at Rs 1.5-1.75 lakh versus Rs 1.3 lakh for an autorickshaw) and the added advantage that it has is the full weight of the Bajaj Auto distribution network (nearly 500 dealers and 1,500 service centres across India) behind it. Whether that will be enough to drive sales of the RE60 remains to be seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Nano: Second life</strong></p>\n<p>There was so much fanfare when Tata Motors finally rolled out the Nano in 2009. It was touted as the great hope of the Indian middle class, the car that would allow families to travel together in safety and comfort &mdash; and not break the bank, either. But that was then. Relocating the plant from West Bengal to Gujarat disrupted production schedules and delayed deliveries. Then, safety concerns over manufacturing flaws made buyers cancel bookings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It did not help that Tata Motors seemed to expect the Nano to sell by itself. The first TV commercial for the car was aired only two years after the launch and it stuck to the original brief, portraying a lower-income family in small-town India. Not surprisingly, not only was there no brand connect with urban Indians, there was no aspirational value attached to the car. The result: Against an installed capacity of 250,000 cars a year, Tata Motors sold 70,432 Nanos in FY11 and 47,112 units in FY12 till date, according to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). The original target of 25,000 units a month now seems a distant dream. So much so that even Tata group chairman Ratan Tata recently called the Nano, his pet project, a &ldquo;failed opportunity&rdquo;.</p>\n<p><strong>Bumpy ride - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p>Siddharth Singh, associate professor of marketing at Hyderabad&rsquo;s Indian School of Business, says Tata should not have presented Nano as a cheap car. Instead, it should have been showcased as a better-value alternative to entry-level cars. &ldquo;Aspirational consumers may not want to buy a cheap car midway between a &lsquo;real&rsquo; car and a two-wheeler,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They may be interested in a &lsquo;real&rsquo; car even if they have to pay a little more.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That change is now happening. An updated version of the Nano was launched a couple of months ago, and it came with better mileage and air-conditioning. Features like booster-assisted brakes (which provide additional brake power so the driver does not need to exert unnecessary force), which were earlier available only in the higher end models, have now been added even to the standard model. The interiors have been upgraded to look more premium and eight new colours with exotic names like neon rush, mojito green and meteor silver have been introduced. Significantly, the Nano&rsquo;s USP &mdash; its price &mdash; remains unchanged.</p>\n<p>The company&rsquo;s plan is fairly simple &mdash; and quite obvious. It is time to steer the Nano away from its &lsquo;poor man&rsquo;s drive&rsquo; image that seems to have stuck to it. The latest advertising campaign for the Nano 2012 shows a group of young friends zipping through bumpy terrain and highways for a cup of tea. &ldquo;The focus for the new communication was to showcase the car&rsquo;s capabilities and performance,&rdquo; points out Sarita Raghavan, business head, Rediffusion Y&amp;R, Tata Motors&rsquo; ad agency. She adds that the two-month-old campaign is already showing results. &ldquo;The commercial has over 100,000 hits online and there has been an increase in walk-ins and enquiries at dealerships.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But an ad campaign alone won&rsquo;t be enough to solve all that ails the Nano. Tata Motors is also ensuring that distribution and financing are in order. Easier and faster loans, exclusive showrooms in tier 3 and tier 4 cities and the option to buy an extended warranty and maintenance contract for a token amount (Rs 99) are just some of the ways by which it is wooing buyers back.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Will all this work? Harish Bijoor, CEO of the Bangalore-based brand consultancy that goes by his name, has his doubts. &ldquo;Tata Motors has changed gears completely from its last campaign and such drastic change brings the danger of inconsistency in the message. And while this campaign will work with urban consumers, will it connect with the tier 3 and 4 markets? I&rsquo;m not so sure.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>', 'Small cars have become hot property, especially with Bajaj''s new four-wheeler and Tata''s repositioned Nano', '33,40', '', 0, '', 'small-wonders-490', 484, 1, 0, 0, 13, 'Small Wonders ', 'Small cars have become hot property, especially with Bajaj''s new four-wheeler and Tata''s repositioned Nano', '', '', '', 'Bajaj Auto,Bajaj RE60,Tata Motors,Nano', 0, NULL, '2015-02-11 15:12:40', '2015-03-02 14:28:06', '2012-02-18', 0),

There are too many no-smoking areas and most smokers use lighters,&rdquo; he says with some regret.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If that is true, Khanna could end up making a fortune if matchboxes go extinct. &ldquo;This is just a pursuit with no intention to monetise,&rdquo; he says with a glint. For the uninitiated, this is quite different from collecting stamps or maps, which calls for greater attention and even some running costs. In contrast, Khanna hasn&rsquo;t paid more than <span>&euro;</span>2 for a box. &ldquo;The only hitch is they get a little moist during the rains,&rdquo; he points out. The best place to look for a matchbox is the hotel room. Khanna himself confesses to pinching quite a few and says there are antique shops in Europe that sell very affordable matchboxes. &ldquo;In the past, airlines like Pan Am gave matchboxes away. That never takes place today,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Khanna&rsquo;s collection is large and continues to grow. He was gifted 2,000 matchboxes by a relative a few years ago, but he is not aware of an association of people who collect matchboxes.

But that&rsquo;s far from the truth. <em>Beyond the Familiar</em> starts like that and I started reading it with some trepidation. But that apart, it is a readable book and it does drive home truths and workable management principles.</p>\r\n<p>A disturbing fact that only 1% of 6,000 large public companies sustained profitable growth over the full 15 years between 1990 and 2004 and only 24% over any five consecutive years, sets the tone of the book. The authors then go on to show with real examples how most companies that mouth the obvious sound principles of management rarely follow or execute. The principles of an &ldquo;open organisation, relevant customer performance, customer trust, continuous improvement and innovating beyond the familiar&rdquo; are generally ignored, resulting in dire consequences. How Nokia won by being an open organisation, but lost its global position by not innovating; P&amp;G&rsquo;s remarkable success story through close contact with its consumers; Infosys&rsquo; growth through its clarity of vision; and GE&rsquo;s investment in adjacent innovation are some examples of success exemplified in the book.</p>\r\n<p>What I found interesting was the fact that to be successful, you do not always need to be the &ldquo;first&rdquo; in path-breaking innovation or have the &ldquo;best&rdquo; product. In many cases, being a great &ldquo;follower&rdquo; and offering &ldquo;consistency&rdquo; resulted in sustained growth. Indian examples that come to mind as great followers are Nirma, Ghari Detergent, etc, and the Kwality restaurant chain for consistency of quality. The authors offer examples of Apple and P&amp;G being fast followers. They also emphasise that it is important to deal with customer dissatisfaction rather than mere customer delight. A subtle but critical difference. The use of research and social media is a must.</p>\r\n<p>The book is repetitive in parts but its essence is that apart from trying to deliver a big idea, it is as important to resort to incremental innovations and win consumer trust. Above all, openness for constant improvement and not becoming complacent when you&rsquo;re a leader, are key to sustained success. The CEO&rsquo;s role is vital to ensure this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The book is worth a read.

(498, 11, '', 'Lucky 30', '<p>Everybody is twisted in their own way and has a vice or two. For those with means, vices are cultivated and those who can&rsquo;t, make do with what they get. For rich Kutchi businessmen, smoking a <em>beedi</em> could well be a taste or style statement, but for the <em>aam aadmi</em>, a <em>beedi</em> is the cheapest luxury he can afford. Appearances though can be deceptive and at times very. For, at the heart of the humble &lsquo;30&rsquo; brand <em>beedi</em> lies an even humbler rag to riches tale of the Mangalore based Bharath Group.</p>\n<p>Its founder, B Manjunath Pai, ran away from home when he was 15 years old. He was certain that if he stayed, he would end up bent over wood fires cooking feasts for temples and weddings, like his parents did before him. The young lad survived by working in a corner store next door to a local temple in the sleepy town of Karkala in coastal Karnataka. To sustain his &lsquo;Houdini&rsquo; act, he graduated to selling saris, slept outside the sari shop at night and learnt to roll <em>beedi</em>s in between customers. He then started hawking his self-rolled <em>beedi</em>s and since they sold well, he decided to make it his main activity. All he had then, was his savings of #30 and that is where the brand name for his best selling <em>beedi </em>would come from &mdash; &lsquo;Thirty Number&rsquo; also known as <em>Tees Chaap </em>in Hindi.</p>\n<p>In 1962, the company moved its administrative office from Karkala to Mangalore for better connectivity. Today, Bharath Beedi Works has a network of 15 centres across Udupi and Mangalore. Raw material is distributed to designated contractors (who issue it to workers) from these centres, and finished <em>beedi</em>s are collected and deposited by them. Inventory is managed smoothly to make sure there&rsquo;s just 10 days&rsquo; stock of raw materials and finished goods at any given point of time. And since, the company has mastered <em>beedi</em> manufacturing over 82 years, it&rsquo;s practically impossible for a competitor to replicate its product overnight. After all, the entire process is important: the sourcing of the <em>tendu </em>leaf, the right mix of tobacco, rolling it right and roasting it perfectly.</p>\n<p><strong>"<em>Satya</em> (truth), <em>Dharma</em> (duty) and <em>Nishtha</em> (devotion) encompasses my management philosophy" - B Ganapathi Pai, chairman, Bharath Group&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>For maintaining this consistency, credit is due to the founder and then his eldest son B Ganapathi Pai, who ably took on the mantle despite personal adversity. Due to the untimely demise of his brothers in the late 70s, Pai worked shoulder to shoulder with his father until the latter passed away in 1982. After that, Pai slogged doggedly for the next two decades till his children and those of his brothers were able to join the business. Till this day, B Manjunath Pai continues to be his greatest inspiration. B Ganapathi Pai, chairman, Bharath Group reminisces, &ldquo;My father taught me three things &mdash; <em>Satya</em> (truth), <em>Dharma </em>(duty), <em>Nishtha </em>(devotion) and that encompasses my entire management philosophy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Lighting up</strong></p>\n<p>While <em>beedi</em> is said to have originated in the 1890s in Madhya Pradesh, it was in Mangalore where its making was elevated to a fine art. Pai says, &ldquo;Rolling a <em>beedi</em> is a time tested process, more like a family recipe and that is why Mangalore <em>beedi</em>s are famous for their finish and enjoy a premium in the market.&rdquo; The big jump came when competitors in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan switched over to manufacturing Mangalore type <em>beedi</em>s in the 70s and 80s. Without the benefit of visible differentiation, seasoned as well as inquisitive consumers turned to the <em>beedi</em> that gave them the best puff. From rolling 30 <em>beedi</em>s on the founding day, the company now rolls out 60 million <em>beedi</em>s each day, 300 days of the year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another interesting fact about the company is that its <em>beedi</em> is rolled in Mangalore but consumed largely in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and parts of western Uttar Pradesh through a network of more than 500 distributors. While it was a logistical nightmare to start with, it has now been converted into a distinct strength &mdash; a reach of over 100 cities and over 100,000 retail outlets -&mdash; one that the company intends to leverage going forward. Not only that; it has a near monopoly in exports having started in 1975, about 30% of its production is shipped to the Middle East, South East Asia, South Africa and Japan.</p>\n<p>Besides its existing markets, for future growth the company is banking on breaking into adjoining areas where it has a strong base, say into eastern Madhya Pradesh, eastern Maharashtra, etc, and into new markets such as Uttarakhand where it is in talks with distributors and retailers. Since tobacco products are not allowed to advertise, retailer push is critical.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Clich&eacute;d as it may sound, the bond established over three quarters of a century between the company, its employees and the trade, holds the key. &ldquo;We have always incentivised our distributors,&rdquo; Pai says. &ldquo;For example, if there is a price hike, the distributor is given an average month&rsquo;s sales stock at the old price and it&rsquo;s our policy that they must pass on 50% of the benefit down the chain.&rdquo; Discreet checks are done to ensure that is indeed complied with and it is such steps that have given the company a strong foothold within the trading community. Pai adds, &ldquo;As a result, most of our employees have been with us for 30-40 years and many of our distributors and suppliers have been there for generations.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Puffing on</strong></p>\n<p>Though Bharath Beedi has been able to withstand competition from other national players like Mangalore Ganesh, Telephone, Desai and Pataka, it cannot afford to sit on its laurels. Rising input costs apart, the biggest challenge is the lack of a uniform minimum wage in the industry. <em>Beedi</em> workers in north India and West Bengal get half the wages paid in Karnataka for the same amount of work. So, if the minimum wage is Rs 120 per 1,000 <em>beedi</em>s in Karnataka, the comparative rolling cost is Rs 70 in Uttar Pradesh and Rs 60 in West Bengal. It is unlikely that any respite is in sight for Bharath Beedi, given that revision of minimum wage is a state issue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The company&rsquo;s worries do not end here. Besides the wage disparity, there is also the unorganised and counterfeit market to deal with. Half the total <em>beedi</em> market of Rs 5,000 crore is catered to by manufacturers who do not pay applicable duties and under-invoice their production, which is reflected in their lower selling price. So, while Bharath&rsquo;s &lsquo;30&rsquo; brand sells 25 <em>beedi</em>s for Rs 10, its counterpart in West Bengal could be selling 25 <em>beedi</em>s for Rs 6 or Rs 7. The organised market of Rs 2,500 crore is further equally divided between Mangalore and non-Mangalore <em>beedi</em>s and it is in the single brand Mangalore type <em>beedi</em> that &lsquo;30&rsquo; brand stands out with a third of the market share. Moreover, for a minimum wage paying player like Bharath Beedi, labour makes up 60-65% of cost. Transportation and raw material take up another 30-35%, leaving it with a 5-10% net margin. Reducing labour cost through mechanisation is also not possible as naturally grown <em>tendu </em>leaves cannot be standardised and fed through machines. In fact, manual cutting of the leaf minimises wastage (only defective sections are cut away).</p>\n<p><strong>Burning bright - Graphic</strong></p>\n<p>While the introduction of GST will be a positive, non-uniform VAT and the current cost structure leaves the company with very little operating leeway. Pai laments. &ldquo;The irony is West Bengal is the cheapest place to manufacture <em>beedi</em>s in the country. A state which was Communist for a large part of its history is paying the lowest wage. How can I compete with someone paying half the wages?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s another dimension to the labour problem. The younger generation of workers, often better educated and attracted to more lucrative jobs, is not coming into the industry, leading to a shortfall in production. Pai cautions, &ldquo;While we have consciously avoided it so far, the eventual outcome would be that we will have to unwillingly migrate production to other states.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As it is foolhardy to compete on price and it does not want to deviate from its minimum wage commitment, Bharath Beedi is focusing on brand building and maintaining quality. Finely blended non-Virginia tobacco is the heart of a <em>beedi</em>. So, the company has started procuring tobacco directly from farmers and processing it at Nipani, near the Karnataka-Maharashtra border. More than the cost saving, the organic farming being promoted ensures that tobacco quality remains consistent. The other positive fallout is the strengthening of the bond with the farmer as after every crop, the company buys the farmer&rsquo;s output irrespective of whether the quantity and quality delivered was as agreed upon. Where possible, the company blends such tobacco bought without compromising quality, but its assured buying ensures that it gets a discount during times of shortage.</p>\n<p><strong>Right blend</strong></p>\n<p>Tobacco and tobacco-based products may have an ominous ring to them but Pai does not shy away from pointing out the collateral benefits enjoyed by the overall community. &ldquo;Tobacco might be bad, but it is our <em>annadatta </em>(provider of food),&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;What is most heartening is that a major part of our workforce is women and despite working from home, they are eligible for bonus, maternity leave as well as PF benefits, unlike in the unorganised sector.&rdquo; Even if the Bharath Group&rsquo;s ongoing, manifold and pro-active &lsquo;giving back to society&rsquo; activities are ignored, there are many stories of women supporting their families and enabling a higher education for their children with the wages they earn by rolling <em>beedi</em>s. Bharath Beedi therefore has always been seen as a benevolent employer not only in its district but the entire state as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bollywood stumbled upon a pining heart and unadulterated lust via <em>Beedi Jalai Le </em>only in 2006, but for B Manjunath Pai, the founder of Bharath Beedi Works, the fire in his belly must have burnt the brightest on July 30, 1930. The empire seeded with Rs 30 that day has metamorphosed into a Rs 700 crore group today, with the core business still contributing 75% of the revenues and much of the profit. Despite having diversified into printing, automobiles, bookstores, real estate and malls, its cash rich position ensures that its entire expansion is funded through internal accruals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In its own way the number 30 has been lucky for the company. So much so that Pai says, &ldquo;People in the trade associated with us go with 30 voluntarily, and all our associates consider 30 their lucky charm &mdash; their car and phone numbers invariably have 30 in them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The genius of B Manjunath Pai lies in the way he went about organising a work force that was scalable as the company grew. And grow it did, it is only now that scaling up has hit a roadblock due to the playing field getting more uneven. The story of the &lsquo;30&rsquo; brand and its creator are intertwined. It&rsquo;s hard to distinguish where the creator stops and the brand begins, and vice versa. The brand initially flourished due to the zeal of the founder and then due to the sheer tenacity of B Ganapathi Pai. The goodwill they generated together has not only paid back many times over but continues to sustain Bharath Beedi Works even today.&nbsp;</p>', 'The growth of thirty brand beedi over the years has been driven by a combination of grit, quality and fair play ', '2', '', 0, '', 'lucky-30-498', 492, 1, 0, 0, 13, 'Lucky 30', 'The growth of thirty brand beedi over the years has been driven by a combination of grit, quality and fair play ', '', '', '', '30 Brand beedi,Bharath Group,Bharath Beedi Works', 0, NULL, '2015-02-11 17:44:41', '2015-03-02 14:21:05', '2012-03-03', 0),

Currently the factory is operating at 50% capacity (1,500-1,800 litres per day) in the peak season, but Taranjeet Singh, Gurbachan&rsquo;s son, plans to double capacity in two years, given sufficient demand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Currently, apart from parlours in Netaji Subhash Place, Model Town and Punjabi Bagh, Giani has expanded via the franchisee route since 2008, growing to 20 franchisee-run parlours in Delhi, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Ludhiana, Amritsar and Chandigarh. As production capacity can be increased without higher investment, the Singhs are planning on growing regionally with more outlets in the neighbouring states, which is bound to improve margins and profits.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of now, ice cream is supplied once in 15 days. The cost of a single refrigerated truck trip to, say, Amritsar and Ludhiana from Manesar is about Rs 5,000-6,000, borne equally by the franchisee stores in the two cities. Jaipur, less than 200 km from Manesar on the same highway, is also easily serviceable.&nbsp; Gurcharan Singh, meanwhile, does not see Mother Dairy, Amul and Kwality Walls as his competitors. &ldquo;They sell ice creams in a packed form,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We sell ours in parlours.&rdquo; Giani also adds <em>gajar</em> and <em>dal</em> <em>halwas</em> to its menu in the lean (winter) season.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The senior Singh has an interesting array of syrup jars on the table, each labelled more exotically than the other &mdash; musk melon, lemon green tea, blackberry. &ldquo;Till a few years ago, no one had heard of blackberry or blueberry,&rdquo; says Gurbachan. &ldquo;Ice creams were all about vanilla, strawberry and tutti-frutti.&rdquo; Not any more. The Giani Special, Belgian Chocolate and Hot Chocolate Fudge are among the chain&rsquo;s bestsellers. &ldquo;We add at least one flavour a month,&rdquo; says Taranjeet Singh, who did a course on frozen desserts in Italy and is the moving force behind Giani&rsquo;s tasty experiments. Gelatos were introduced three years ago and there is also a sugar-free variant for diabetics.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Freeze zone</strong></p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Their product range and pricing is very smartly done,&rdquo; says Harminder Sahni, founder and MD, Wazir Advisors, a Gurgaon-based management consulting firm. &ldquo;The ice cream has been kept affordable and cost much less than it would in a restaurant. Moreover, the focus is entirely on ice cream. If you go to Nirula&rsquo;s, ice cream is not the only thing they serve.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If the widespread trend of eating out has favoured the hotels and restaurants business, Giani has something else working for it. &ldquo;Earlier, people used to have ice cream very occasionally,&rdquo; says Gurbachan Singh. &ldquo;Now, they have become more regular.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Not surprisingly, the turnover shot up from Rs 30 lakh in 2006 to Rs 1.25 crore in 2011. Profits are in the range of 15% to 20% of sales but, margins are thinning with increasing costs. &ldquo;In the last two decades the prices were raised only once in three or four years,&rdquo; says Gurbachan Singh, who admits they are now forced to raise prices every year &mdash; the last upward revision came six months ago. The Singhs try to keep labour costs low and manage with about 30 employees at their factory and three owned outlets.&nbsp;Gurbachan Singh is not a big fan of malls either: &ldquo;People go there mostly to do window shopping, and rentals for shops are very high, too.&rdquo; Only four of Giani&rsquo;s 20 franchisee-run outlets are located in malls.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>"In the past two decades, prices were raised only once in three or four years. now we have to increase them every year" - Gurbachan Singh, proprietor, Giani Ice Cream</strong></p>\r\n<p>Have there been PE offers? &ldquo;Investors have approached us but we don&rsquo;t want to sell for now,&rdquo; says Gurbachan Singh, who says he feels emotionally attached to the business founded by his father. &ldquo;It can affect the quality of products.&rdquo; Moreover, &ldquo;PE is not the answer to every small business,&rdquo; Wazir&rsquo;s Sahni says. &ldquo;Not everyone can get it and not everyone can handle it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>However, Giani&rsquo;s certainly needs to learn a thing or two about upgrading the ambience of its parlours to woo customers. &ldquo;The management&rsquo;s attitude has to change from &lsquo;transactional&rsquo; to &lsquo;professional&rsquo;, which reflects in all such things,&rdquo; Sahni says.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Singhs, though, have some audacious plans. &ldquo;We want to be the number one ice cream in India,&rdquo; says Taranjeet Singh. &ldquo;We are looking at UP and just opened a store in Rajasthan. We will think about the south only after we have covered the north.&rdquo;&nbsp;To get there, his strategy is as simple as it has been successful, &ldquo;We stick to quality and we try to provide fresh ice cream at a reasonable price.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>', 'Giani Ice Cream intends to stay irresistibly affordable and come close to your neighbourhood ', '9', '0', 0, '', 'capital-flavours-499', 493, 1, 1, 1, 19, 'Capital flavours', 'Giani ice cream intends to stay irresistibly affordable and come close to your neighbourhood ', '', '', '', 'Giani Ice Cream', 0, NULL, '2015-02-11 18:12:37', '2015-06-22 11:53:03', '2012-03-03', 43),
(500, 35, '0', 'Clickety click', '<p>Bengaluru-based Tresa George, 25, is new to the world of internet shopping. After her first online purchase in December, she now shops online for almost everything except groceries. George, who works at Goldman Sachs, says she has no time to shop and online stores help her buy things she wants at the click of a mouse. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so convenient,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I get the product in a week and if I don&rsquo;t like it, the delivery man comes back to pick it up, so I can return it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Thousands of others like George have taken to online shopping like never before. It&rsquo;s difficult to resist online stores like Myntra, Fashionandyou and 99labels, which offer more products and better prices than neighbourhood stores. And consumer appetite for online shopping is so strong that there are nearly 200 online stores now.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Online retailing kicked off in a big way with the launch of websites like Flipkart and Myntra in 2007. Myntra was launched in the personal products space and then repositioned as a lifestyle and fashion retailer in late 2010. Some of these companies expect to turn profitable this year &mdash; Myntra and Fashionandyou say it will happen by December and, in keeping with the industry trend, online retailers who have launched in the last six months or so say break even will take three or four years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Industry body Assocham says the online retail market will grow to Rs 7,000 crore by 2015 from Rs 2,000 crore now, backed by the easy availability of broadband services and increasing internet penetration across the country. The figure looks quite plausible considering the 15-20% month-on-month growth seen by most online retail sites. Some like Zivame (an online lingerie store), which started operations six months back, is seeing 100% month-on-month growth in sales.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am quite surprised at our growth,&rdquo; says Richa Kar, CEO. &ldquo;We get most of our orders from small cities and towns such as Girudi in Bihar, Padra in Gujarat and Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu. We see this as an achievement.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Tiered story</strong></p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just Zivame. The entire e-commerce industry is getting its maximum growth from tier 2 and 3 cities. While buyers in tier 1 cities shop online for convenience, shoppers in lower-tier cities turn to online stores because their preferred brands don&rsquo;t have a retail presence in their town, or don&rsquo;t stock the products they want.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Vijay Gumani, who runs a chain of baby products stores in Bengaluru called Appleofmyi, says constant enquiries from people in smaller towns led to the store going online as Hoopos. Currently, Hoopos services 2,400 pincodes, including interior locations in the North East.</p>\r\n<p>In a sense, online stores have become a proxy for brick and mortar stores, filling in the gap created by the low penetration of brands in India. The country&rsquo;s online retail growth story is quite different from that of the West, where the physical retail network was established first, after which sales shifted away from stores to online retailers. &ldquo;In India, it&rsquo;s the reverse. Online retailing is growing before we can see growth in brick and mortar stores,&rdquo; says Gumani.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Organised retail is just 4-5% of the $550-billion Indian retail market and a small percentage of that is present in lower tier cities. &ldquo;Brand penetration is low in India because the economics don&rsquo;t work for retailers to put up a store in a city where only a few customers may want to buy their products. For such customers, the only access to merchandise is through online stores,&rdquo; says Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail consultancy Technopak Advisors. Mukesh Bansal, CEO, Myntra, says 50% of the 10,000 orders his site gets in a day come from lower tier cities. &ldquo;The online medium gives big brands a platform to reach out to buyers in smaller cities.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Going cheap</strong></p>\r\n<p>Another key driver for online sales is the heavy discount offered by cyber retailers. Flash sale sites such as Fashionandyou and 99labels offer steeply discounted products for a limited time, working like the online version of factory outlets. A sale starts at a specific hour for a limited time and the inventory put up usually sells out within an hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The lifestyle industry produces 30-40% excess stuff every quarter,&rdquo; says Harish Bahl, founder and chairman, Fashionandyou, which gets about 10,000 orders a day. The online store offers brands a platform to liquidate their inventory and, in turn, gets deep discounts.</p>\r\n<p>Ishita Swarup, CEO of 99labels, says discounts for a limited period of time create a sense of urgency among buyers. &ldquo;The feeling that they might miss the sale generates interest,&rdquo; she says. The site sells about 300 domestic brands, besides brands from Europe and the US.</p>\r\n<p>Fashionandyou&rsquo;s Bahl says his model is sustainable because it&rsquo;s the only retailer to have a third of its merchandise change every day. A sale lasts for only three days on Bahl&rsquo;s portal, which means everyday 33% of the goods on the site are fresh stuff. His company works with 800-1,000 merchants, so sourcing products is not a problem. &ldquo;Even if we have 10-12 discount sales every day, a brand will repeat itself only every three months,&rdquo; says Bahl. The repeat presence is sure because brands do end up with excess stock every quarter.</p>\r\n<p>Beside, online stores can offer huge discounts since they don&rsquo;t have to pay for real estate, which forms 35-40% of total costs for a retail store. Of course, the sites still have to incur expenses on technology, warehousing, logistics and marketing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But not all sites follow the flash sale model. Myntra sells products at the maximum retail price (MRP). Myntra&rsquo;s Bansal says discount sales may happen in the future but they will be a small portion of the pie at Myntra. &ldquo;To scale up and sustain the business, discount retailers will have to&nbsp; morph into an MRP model,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\r\n<p>Technopak&rsquo;s Singhal feels there is enough space for all kinds of online stores. He notes, &ldquo;Growth in India will be much quicker than in the US because there are still many products that are not sold online.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Take my money&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>Naturally, venture capital and private equity players are sensing a serious business opportunity in the online retail space. PE firms have already invested in close to half a dozen online retailers. Some examples: Accel India, Tiger Capital and IDG Ventures have invested $38 million in Myntra; Norwest Venture Partners, Intel Capital, Sequoia Capital and Nokia Growth Partners have invested $40 million in Fashionandyou; and 99labels has raised $3.5 million from Infoedge. &ldquo;In the West, e-commerce is a three-decade old industry, whereas in India it has just started growing,&rdquo; says Mukul Singhal, vice president, Saif Partners. Hoping to replicate the success it had with its investment in Vancle, an online apparel store in China, Saif has invested $6 million in Zovi, $10 million in FirstCry and $5 million in InkFruit. The fund also has investments in sites like MakeMyTrip and JustDial.</p>\r\n<p>Prashanth Prakash, partner, Accel India, a US-based VC fund with investments in Flipkart, LetsBuy and Myntra, says investors have always been looking for digital businesses that can achieve a reasonable scale. He adds, &ldquo;Ad-driven businesses have not grown much. They are concentrated between Google and Facebook, whereas e-commerce companies such as Flipkart or Myntra have shown reasonable scale.&rdquo; Prakash should know for Myntra is already targeting a revenue of Rs 500 crore in FY13.</p>\r\n<p>Going ahead, experts feel consolidation in the e-commerce space is inevitable. Notwithstanding the mushrooming of online retailers, only a few sites will survive over the next five years and their success will depend on their business proposition and financial strength.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;In the next nine months, you will witness consolidation,&rdquo; says Singhal, who sees companies that are not able to raise capital shutting down and small niche players being bought over. Consolidation has already started with Flipkart acquiring its smaller rival, LetsBuy. &ldquo;Early stage investors will experiment with consolidation and, in the case of LetsBuy, there was synergy because both retailers sell electronic items,&rdquo; says Prakash.</p>\r\n<p>SAIF&rsquo;s Singhal believes that consolidation in the online retail space will be similar to what happened with online travel portals that shrunk to just three market leaders from around 10-15 portals in the past.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The survival of online stores will depend on a combination of brand building, execution, technology and logistics. Remember, e-commerce, though not in its infancy stage, is still a very new industry.

(501, 36, '0', 'Room to spare', '<p>Chennai is many things to many people but a happening address for posh hotels it was not, at least not till a couple of years ago. Now it appears that every hotel major wants a slice of the city&rsquo;s upbeat hospitality sector (<em>See: It&rsquo;s raining hotels</em>). The figures are startling: the number of premium rooms has gone up from 1,800 in FY07 to 3,021, a jump of nearly 65% in less than four years. Another 522 rooms will be added once ITC&rsquo;s Grand Chola opens next month. By FY15, the number of premium rooms in the city would have risen to about 5,010, or 180%, if all the projects coming up meet their deadlines.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>It''s raining hotels- Graphic</strong></p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s likely to lead to an oversupply situation, until this incremental supply is absorbed,&rdquo; says Pavethra Ponniah, analyst, Icra. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also likely to put pressure on ARRs (average room rates).&rdquo; But, as a developing market with multiple feeder businesses in the manufacturing and servicing sectors, Ponniah feels the city has the potential over the longer term to absorb the glut. In the short to medium term, the Chennai conference and exhibition market is enjoying higher conference traffic, diverted from Hyderabad due to the Telangana-related unrest in the Andhra metro. The southern metro has recovered faster from the slowdown than other Indian cities, due to its proximity to the auto industry and the revival in the IT/ITeS sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The India State Ranking Survey 2011 by global hospitality consultancy HVS says Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have an ideal market for hotels based on state expenditure on tourism and the necessary infrastructure to support tourist arrivals. At 68.2%, Chennai&rsquo;s occupancy rate is better than that of Delhi (66.7%) and Mumbai (62.5%). Sunjae&nbsp;Sharma, general manager, Hyatt Regency, which opened in August last year and will remain the biggest luxury hotel in Chennai till ITC&rsquo;s Grand Chola launches next month, strikes an optimistic note, &ldquo;The city has a buoyant industrial sector and the addition of global hospitality players will fuel supply and push demand further.&rdquo; That will take quite some time. In the meantime, customers have a reason to cheer. The incremental supply in rooms is likely to improve the value for money proposition in the hotel industry in Chennai &mdash; if demand is high and there aren&rsquo;t enough rooms to go around, rates skyrocket without infrastructure to match.
